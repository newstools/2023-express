A package worth four percent for two consecutive years could be offered in the coming days. Most unions are expected to reject the new deal but rail firms hope that if train drivers in Aslef can be convinced to accept, it may put pressure on the RMT leader Mick Lynch to accept a compromise. Just one in 10 services will run on today’s “Tragic Thursday” – the worst day of strike action in a working week for decades. The offer may be formally put to Aslef, which is striking today, early next week. It has also emerged the rail industry is considering offering discounts for family trips and lifting the cap on season tickets to achieve a breakthrough. Rail bosses are worried some members voted against a previous pay deal without first knowing all of the perks. The family members of rail staff will be entitled to a 75 percent reduction on fares for leisure travel. Bigger discounts are also being offered for workers’ annual season tickets. Rail staff get 75 percent off but this is capped at £2,750 annually. Any cost above this is borne by rail workers. Discussions are underway about removing the cap, a move described by rail insiders as “a game changer” as most workers do not have train travel paid for by their employer.
