Kate Hudson, 43, donned a pale yellow two-piece and a matching yellow trench coat as she walked the red carpet at the BAFTA Tea Party in Beverly Hills. The Hollywood actress exposed her toned midriff and sensational figure in the tightfitting ensemble. Kate placed the yellow coat over her shoulders and accessorised with sparkly silver heels and a matching clutch. She pulled her blonde hair into a bun and parted her bangs in the middle. The BAFTA Tea Party "welcomes nominees, members and guests for a uniquely elegant gathering. The event is an exclusive affair, limited to invited guests and BAFTA Members only," according to its website.
