Medvedev suggested Nato leaders should stop sending arms and ammunition to the Ukrainian military in support of President Zelensky or face a nuclear response. In a post on Telegram, the former Russian president said: "The defeat of a nuclear power in a conventional war may trigger a nuclear war. Nuclear powers have never lost major conflicts on which their fate depends. And this should be obvious to anyone. Even a Western politician with any trace of intelligence." In a clear warning to NATO leaders, Medvedev highlighted the risks of their policy on aiding Ukraine ahead of their meeting at Ramstein Air Base, Germany. The agenda for the summit includes discussing strategies and providing support for the West's mission to counter Russian forces in Ukraine. Medvedev, who served as the president of Russia from 2008 to 2012, currently holds the post of deputy head in Russia's security council led by Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin has clarified that Medvedev's statements coincided with Moscow's existing nuclear doctrine. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES..
