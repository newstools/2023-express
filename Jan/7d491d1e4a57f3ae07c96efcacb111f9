A volcano in Hawaii is erupting once again with a code red warning issued. Kilauea, the most active volcano on the island, only stopped erupting in December for the first time since September 2021. "The opening phases of eruptions are dynamic. Webcam imagery shows fissures at the base of Halemaʻumaʻu crater generating lava flows on the surface of the crater floor," the USGS said. "The activity is confined to Halemaʻumaʻu and the hazards will be reassessed as the eruption progresses." The Hawaii Emergency Management Agency said lava is confined to the crater and that no communities are threatened.

It comes after a rare dual eruption on Hawaii’s Big Island, where for around two weeks starting November 27, Mauna Loa and Kilauea were both active at the same time. The double eruption was so unique because the volcanoes are fed by different magma or "plumbing" systems, and neither eruption is sparked by the other, Jessica Ferracane, public affairs specialist for Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, told ABC News. Previously Mauna Loa had not erupted since 1984.
