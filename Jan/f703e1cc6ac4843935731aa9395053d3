Ageless Amanda Holden looks sensational in this round-up of her best photos from last year. The star has enjoyed a series of luxurious holidays, including her most recent getaway over the festive season, when she stretched out her long limbs at a Mauritius resort while surrounded by palm trees. Earlier in the year, she also practised her diving skills in glamorous Greece, and biked around picturesque Cornwall, while work recently took her to Sicily for filming sessions. The Britain's Got Talent judge declared passionately in one Facebook video: "I live for holidays!" - and her compilation of bikini-clad photos clearly documents how much she enjoys sun, sea and sand. One of Amanda's favourite swimwear brands is Melissa Odabash, and she's rocked numerous bikinis by the renowned designer over the months, among others, much to the delight of her 1.8 million followers.
