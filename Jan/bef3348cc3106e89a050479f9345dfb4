The Channel 4 reality star shared no less than eight snaps with her 468,000 Instagram followers. The couple were seen taking in the major tourist attractions in the French capital, as they seemingly put their recent difficulties behind them. The 31-year-old Gogglebox regular, who is expecting her first child, captioned her upload simply: "Ellie and Nat in Paris FR." It was soon liked more than 30,000 times, with some cheeky fans asking if a proposal was on the cards. Their trip comes 10 months after Nat was left fighting for his life. He was involved in a terrifying car crash, in which he suffered a broken neck and back, as well as two collapsed lungs.
