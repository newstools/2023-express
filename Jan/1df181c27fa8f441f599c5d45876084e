Midsomer Murders season 23 started on AcornTV in America in December 2022 with new episodes airing on a weekly basis. So far, there has been no word from ITV on when the beloved British crime drama is going to be airing on this side of the pond. So, for now at least, fans are going to have to relive previous episodes, including The Ghost of Causton Abbey which airs on Friday, January 13, at 9pm. WARNING: This article contains spoilers from Midsomer Murders. Sylvia Reynolds is seen as a fading stage actress who is in town when a disused abbey, that is believed to be cursed, is about to be turned into a pub. But following the launch night, the locals and Sylvia are spooked as the supposed curse claims its first victim. Legendary musical theatre performer Elaine Paige is behind Sylvia Reynolds and is probably best known for starring in the original West End production of Cats as Grizabella. As well as a radio presenter, singer and producer, Paige has appeared in a number of series and films, such as Life, Speed Love, Tales of the Unexpected, Marple and Home from Home.

She went on to star in the iconic Carry On films Follow That Camel and Carry on Doctor. In more recent years, Harris has had minor roles in Casualty, People are Messy and EastEnders. Few details are known about the character of Irene Taylor ahead of the episode airing. Pathologist Fleur Perkins is first introduced at the start of season 20 and makes quite an impression with DCI John Barnaby (played by Neil Dudgeon). She can't help but crack a few deadpan jokes which don't exactly sit right with him in the first instance. EastEnders fans will remember actress Annette Badland as Babe Smith for three years before making her exit in 2017. She has also been behind Margaret Blaine in Doctor Who, Mrs Glenna Fitzgibbons in Outlander season one and Mae in Ted Lasso.
