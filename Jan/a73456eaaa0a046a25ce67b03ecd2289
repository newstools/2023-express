Princess Beatrice appears to be going through a style revolution of late, having stepped out in a series of sophisticated ensembles and elegant outfits to attend recent events. Many royal fans think her style shifted towards more flattering, statement pieces since the birth of her daughter, Sienna. From dramatic silhouettes to striking floral prints, the 34-year-old royal's style has firmly earned her a reputation for being one of the best-dressed royal ladies. There's one element to her effortless dressing, however, that has become synonymous with Beatrice's style - a headband. The royal owns them in several colours and textures to complement her famous auburn hair. Out of all the Royal Family, no one wears a headband quite like Princess Beatrice. There's something about the royal's go-to accessory that elevates every ensemble.
