Mark Labbett, 57, has not been shy at showing off her incredible 10 stone weight loss, with The Chase star making an appearance last night at London's Dominion Theatre. The Chaser was making an appearance at the Dirty Dancing West End press launch, making sure to pose alongside the show's stars. Mark looked dapper in a white shirt and dark smart coat, teamed with black trousers and shiny leather shoes. He posed for snaps alongside Baby actress Kira Malou, with the quizzer towering over the young lady as she sported a black mini dress with a sheer train. Mark completely changed his diet due to battling diabetes and said that played a part in the reasoning behind his weight loss.
