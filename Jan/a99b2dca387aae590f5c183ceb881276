Patrick Mahomes has admitted he leant on NFL legend Tom Brady for advice ahead of Sunday's AFC Championship game. The Kansas City Chiefs take on the Philadelphia Eagles at Arrowhead on Sunday night. The Chiefs are aiming to make the Super Bowl for the third time in five years, and have been favourites to win the whole thing for the majority of the season. Mahomes, widely regarded as the best quarterback of his generation, has the chance to cement that legacy if he is able to lead the Chiefs to another ring. With the pressure of a franchise on his shoulders, Mahomes has sought advice from seven-time Super Bowl winner Brady. Ahead of Sunday's game, the 27-year-old opened up on his conversations with the 'GOAT'. He said: “I talked to Tom a little bit, I have a good relationship with him now and he gives me a lot of advice. “Why would you not want to learn from the GOAT? Any time anybody like that wants to give me advice I’ll take it in. It’s cool to see the guys you’ve watched growing up, your whole life, be able to talk to you.” Mahomes suffered a high ankle sprain during last week's win over the Jacksonville Jaguars, and had to exit the game early as a result. The injury routinely sidelines players for approximately three weeks, but the quarterback is eager to play. Head coach Andy Reid said: "I mean he's had injuries before so he can bank on that past experience that he's had. He'll do fine. It's just a matter of making sure that he's safe. Safe as you can be out there on the football field." Backup quarterback Chad Henne was forced to come in for Mahomes last week against the Jaguars, and is in line to start against the Eagles if Mahomes' injury flares up again.
