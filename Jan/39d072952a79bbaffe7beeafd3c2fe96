The Australian Open approaches its decisive weekend with the men's semi-finals taking place in Melbourne today. But Novak Djokovic's father, Srdjan, won't be present at Victoria Park amid backlash over his controversial involvement in a pro-Russia video earlier this week. Srdjan Djokovic has broken his silence after featuring in a video with Russian protestors, in which he was heard saying, 'long live Russia' amid the country's invasion of Ukraine. He won't be seated at the Rod Laver Arena when Djokovic faces unseeded American Tommy Paul for a place in Sunday's final. Before the Serb takes to the court on his quest for a 10th Australian Open crown, third seed Stefanos Tsitsipas faces 18th-seed Karen Khachanov. Tsitsipas is vying to reach his second Grand Slam final after the 2021 French Open. British duo Alfie Hewett and Gordon Reid are also aiming for a fourth successive wheelchair doubles title in the final. They face Dutch pairing Maikel Scheffers and Ruben Spaargaren in search of what would be their 15th Grand Slam doubles title. Follow Australian Open LIVE updates below...
