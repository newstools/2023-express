Firefighters are tackling a massive blaze at a warehouse in Shropshire. A Shropshire Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) spokesman said: "We are dealing with a serious fire at Hadley Industrial Estate in Telford. "Crews from Telford, Wellington and Shrewsbury are in attendance. "We are advising all nearby residents to keep windows and doors closed as a precaution due to smoke coming from the building." Video tweeted by SFRS from the scene showed several firefighters outside the building, with smoke pouring out of a large hole in the side. The cause of the fire remains unclear, as does the reason why a hole was blown through the metallic wall at the side. No casualties have been reported as a result of the blaze. Four firefighters wore breathing apparatus and used hose reels and main jets to tackle the fire along with the aerial ladder platform. Station Manager Paul Gray said: “The fire is now out, and crews are damping down and making sure the area is safe. We did advise residents to shut their windows and doors if they were in close proximity to the fire due to the smoke plume but we’d like to reassure the public they can now return to normal. “We believe the fire was caused accidentally by hot works taking place as part of the refurbishment of the building. "I’d like to take this opportunity to thank those on site who worked well with the Service to bring the incident under control with the additional use of some their equipment.” Hadley Industrial Estate is in the north of the town, half a mile from the Princess Royal Hospital.
