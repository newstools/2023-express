If you've taken some time away from Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone 2.0, then now is the perfect moment to jump back in. Both Call of Duty games have just been updated with brand new playlists for January 4. It's great news for fans of Warzone 2.0's Trios mode, because the loadout price has been lowered to $24,000. As for Modern Warfare 2, Infinity Ward has introduced the previously announced Bounty Mode. The news was announced on Twitter, complete with a small list of Playlist patch notes explaining all of the changes. Battle Royale • Solos, Duos, Trios, Quads • 3rd Person BR - Duos • Mini Royale - Trios DMZ • Trios Gameplay changes • The Loadout price in Battle Royale Trios has been lowered to $24000! • Bounty mode - Take down High Value Targets in this new TDM-style mode. Bounty Mode is similar to Team Deathmatch, only with one big difference. The players with the most kills on each team will become High Value Targets. If you're good enough to become a High Value Target, then your position will be displayed on the map, making it difficult to run and hide. On the flipside, if you manage to kill a High Value Target, you'll earn double points for your team. The High Value Target will change throughout the game, meaning you could be next if you start building up a monster killstreak.
