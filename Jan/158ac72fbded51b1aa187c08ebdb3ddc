Hollywood royalty joined forces with actual royalty on Sunday as Zara and Mike Tindall mingled with Thor star Chris Hemsworth and his wife Elsa Pataky. The foursome attended the Magic Millions polo and showjumping event on Australia's Gold Coast. Zara, 41, looked stunning in a electric blue midi dress complete with puffed sleeves and a belt. Rugby ace Mike, 44, also looked dapper in a pale pink blazer worn over a blue shirt and white trousers. Spanish actress Elsa, 46, matched Zara in a blue ruffled dress while Hollywood hunk Chris, 39, looked debonair in a crisp white shirt. Although their friendship may seem unlikely at first, the two couples are part of a group of ambassadors for The Star Gold Coast Magic Millions Carnival and Raceday, plus the Pacific Fair Magic Millions Polo and Showjumping. Later in the day, Zara changed into her riding gear for a competitive game of polo.
