Angelina Jolie, 47, looked effortlessly chic as she stepped out for a bit of shopping with her daughter Zahara, 17, in New York. The Hollywood actress sported a long black trench coat, paired with grey flared trousers and black ankle boots. Angelina went for a simple makeup look, consisting of a glossy lip while accessorising with dark sunglasses and a small black clutch bag. Meanwhile, Zahara cut a casual figure in a blue top and coat, teamed with trousers and a pair of Converse. This comes after Angelina missed the recent Golden Globes where her ex-husband Brad Pitt lost the Best Actor in a Supporting Role gong to Ke Huy Quan.
