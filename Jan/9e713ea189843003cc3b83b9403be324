One in 200 people (262,000) said they had a different gender identity to the sex registered at their birth. London had the highest percentage of trans men and women. It is the first time the voluntary question on gender identity had been included. Those who filled in the Office for National Statistics (ONS) questionnaire were asked: "Is the gender you identify with the same as your sex registered at birth?" Some 45.7 million people (94 percent of the population) answered the question, with 45.4 million (93.5 percent) responding "yes", while 262,000 (0.5 percent) said "no". The other 2.9 million (6 percent) did not answer. Brighton and Hove was the local authority with the highest percentage of people who identified as non-binary - meaning they do not identify as exclusively male or female.  Dr Jane Hamlin, president of the Beaumont Society charity, which supports transgender and non-binary people, said: "It is encouraging that the census included questions about gender identity as this helps to show that although trans people are a tiny minority of the population they account for a large number of real living people. "The number does seem a little on the low side, but so many trans and non-binary people are cautious about revealing they are trans." It is understood the findings will help ministers make policy decisions and comply with equality laws. The ONS also published separate data on sexuality. Across England and Wales, it found more than one in 100 identified as trans or other gender identities in 21 local authorities. The highest percentages were in London's Newham (1.5 percent) and Brent (1.3) plus Oxford (1.3). Bromsgrove and Derbyshire Dales were just 0.2 percent.
