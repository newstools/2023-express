A car crashed into the railings outside Buckingham Palace and exploded into flames. A video has captured the moment a black saloon ploughed into the iron perimeter beside the palace Canada Gate early on Saturday morning. Emergency services rushed to the scene at the western side of The Mall following a call from a bystander around 7.20am and closed off the area. Police and fire services rescued the driver, a man in his 20s, who was not seriously injured. Officials don't believe the incident was terror-related, with police saying in a statement that it was not "suspicious". Footage from the scene shows thick smoke billowing into the sky above Buckingham Palace as the camera nears the fire. A closer view shows the car dwarfed by a column of flames enveloping the bonnet before fire crews arrive. READ MORE: POLL: Should Andrew be allowed to use HRH title again?
