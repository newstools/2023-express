The Good Morning Britain presenters were also joined by journalist and editor Andrew Pierce and political journalist Kevin McGuire. The team continued to discuss the continuous strikes throughout the train services and Royal Mail and the impact it has had on the general public. Kevin passionately gave his opinion and dropped a swear word live on air, leaving Susanna to apologise on his behalf. The conversation began to get heated when they were discussing the Government’s controversial anti-strike laws, which would restrict workers’ right to strike by imposing minimum service levels. Kevin slammed: "I know you parrot the government's propaganda on what happens around Europe. "What have the European Trade Union leaders, what you say about minimum standards is b******s, sorry, I am just quoting Labour propaganda." Susanna gasped in shock at the language Kevin used, and interjected: "Hang on a moment, where did that come from Kevin?"

"So, an apology for people who were offended by that." Trying to make light of the mistake, Kevin asked: "Alright, if I said something that rhymes with 'rollocks' how is that? Are we alright there?" Still not impressed with his language, Susanna continued: "Well I think we all know what word you are referring to Kevin as you said it." Kevin added: "He [Andrew Pierce] is still talking about it, however, we describe it. We have a completely different system in Europe. "First of all they have a fundamental right to strike which we don't have here, you just have protection against being sued at times. "The agreements are by agreements of the minimum standards, the government are going to issue work orders and tell you what to do. "It is going to cause chaos and prolong disputes."
