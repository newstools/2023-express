Gwyneth Paltrow, 50, asked her 8.2 million followers: "Is it this way?... Or is it this way?" The Goop founder wore a black triangle bralette with matching bottoms as she promoted her eye masks. The Iron Mask actress opted to go makeup free as she showed off her taut stomach. She captioned the post: "No matter which way you wear them, they are the best I’ve ever tried @goop eye masks." Fans flocked to comment on the post, as Mrs Marsh wrote: "Why are you so perfect?" while Millie agreed, saying: "You are perfection." Jen remarked: "Too busy staring at your perfect body to notice anything else." Holly added: "Same, same, same GP I can’t process that you are 50."
