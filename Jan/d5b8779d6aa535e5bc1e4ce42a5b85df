 Royal author Omid Scobie hit out at claims the Duchess of Sussex influenced in any way Prince Harry's decision over his exit from the Firm, his family or any other aspect of his life. Appearing on the YouTube channel of Common Sense, the author of the flattering but unauthorised biography Finding Freedom said: "It's bizarre, because I think that the image that is often portrayed is that Meghan is a sort of witch-like character that has cast a spell over Harry and he is unable to make a decision for himself, to think straight, to treat his relationship with his family in the way that he wants or tell his own story without her involvement."    Referring to the six-part Netflix documentary released in December focused on the Sussexes' romance, struggles with the media and exit from the Firm, Mr Scobie added: "And actually, it couldn't be further from the truth, and I think that's something that the docu-series addressed really well, how much of that journey was Harry in the driving seat and Meghan just sort of figuring it out as they went alone. But I think again these are things that don't suit the narrative." FOLLOW THIS LIVE BLOG FOR UPDATES ON THE ROYAL FAMILY...
