Liverpool defender Andy Robertson has hit out at his team-mates for their role in the 3-1 defeat to Brentford before he came on the pitch. The Scotland international came on at half-time when the Reds were trailing 2-0.  Robertson told Viaplay: "Obviously we didn't do what we were supposed to do. It's as simple as that. "We didn't have any runners in-behind, we didn't have anyone high and wide, we didn't have anyone in spaces, we couldn't keep the ball, we lost the second balls, balls in-behind they dealt with, set-pieces they dealt with. So yeah, when you all add all those things up, you're never going to get a result at this place. "We knew what Brentford are good at, it's not hard to work out what they're good at, and they're very consistent at it. We were prepared as to what we were expecting but obviously just struggled with it.

You go in at half-time at 2-0 down and you have to fight an uphill battle. "We tried, the first 15-20 minutes of the second half I thought we pushed well, we got a goal, we obviously got one chalked off, we had a couple of half chances and then we started to commit more bodies forward the later it got and we got hit on the counter-attack. "I don't think we can have any complaints about the result today, about where the three points went, I think Brentford deserved it and that's why we find ourselves in the position that we're in."
