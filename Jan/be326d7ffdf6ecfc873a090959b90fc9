There are under two weeks left of the January transfer window and all around the country the elite Premier League clubs will be busy looking to do some late deals to add to their squads before the deadline. Arsenal have been active over the past few days, and sealed their first signing on Friday with the capture of Belgian winger Leandro Trossard from Brighton. On Friday night, reports emerged that the Gunners could also be interested in Real Madrid central midfielder Eduardo Camavinga. But they have now been dealt a blow in their pursuit, and could be forced to look elsewhere. Meanwhile, Manchester United are already looking ahead to the summer, with rumours intensifying that they could swoop for Tottenham and England striker Harry Kane. The 29-year-old seems to be keen on a move himself, and it remains to be seen if there are developments in the coming days. Spurs themselves surely need to make at least a signing or two soon to appease Antonio Conte, while the likes of Liverpool, Chelsea, Newcastle and Leeds could also open their wallets again before February. So will we see any more confirmed deals today? There is only one place to find out... Join Express Sport's live coverage of the January transfer window below
