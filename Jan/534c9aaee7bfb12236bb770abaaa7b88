Royal Family members harboured "concerns" about the way Prince Harry was using therapy, it has been claimed. The Duke of Sussex, who speaks extensively about his mental health journey and his relationship with therapy in his newly-released book Spare, is understood to have been seeing a therapist while he was living in the UK. While both King Charles and Prince William acknowledged the fifth-in-line to the throne needed professional help to overcome some of his issues, therapy appeared to make him angrier and more determined to blame others for his struggles, the Telegraph wrote. The royals also feared therapy was turning Harry against his family members, the newspaper understands, with Harry reportedly becoming increasingly distant from his father and older brother as he was undergoing therapy. The Duke himself claimed in Spare the Prince of Wales feared his brother was being "brainwashed" by his therapist. This report comes after a separate source told the Independent while speaking about the Sussexes' move to California: "He has been kidnapped by a cult of psychotherapy and Meghan. It is impossible for him to return in these circumstances." FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATESâ€¦
