Jennifer Grey, 62, is known as the face of Hollywood in the 1980s, starring in the likes of Ferris Bueller's Day Off and Dirty Dancing alongside the late Patrick Swayze. The 1987 film has become a cult classic, with Jennifer undergoing quite the transformation in the 37 years since. After the film's release, Jennifer decided to get a rhinoplasty to alter the appearance of her nose. According to the actor, it was at the suggestion of her mother, who believed that the operation would make it easier for casting directors to think of her for further parts. After she underwent surgery on her nose for the second time in the early nineties, however, her face became so unrecognisable Michael Douglas failed to recognise her at a movie premiere.
