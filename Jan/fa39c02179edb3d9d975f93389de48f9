The weekend may be closing in, but there's still a couple of Wordle puzzles to figure out before we're able to relax. If you want to keep your Wordle winning streak alive, then you'll need to work pretty hard to solve this one. Fortunately, this is where Express Online comes in. If you need help solving Wordle 565 for January 5, then head to the bottom of the page for a selection of spoiler-free hints and clues. Good luck, because you're going to need it. The game that spawned a thousand clones, the aim of Wordle is to figure out a five letter word in just six guesses. To solve the puzzle, you'll need to pay close attention to the colour of the tiles. If the tile turns grey, then the letter you've guessed doesn't appear in the final word. If it turns yellow, then the letter appears in the word, just not in that position. A green tile means the letter is in the word and in the correct place. The game is so popular that there's even a Lord of the Rings themed Wordle called Lordle, a musical variant called Heardle, and a hardcore Wordle game called Quordle - where the aim is to guess four words instead of just one. If you're not great with words, then you'll prefer something like Nerdle, where you've got to figure out a maths equation.
