Camilla added that the King’s new spokesman recently took her and a few colleagues out to discuss what the plan was for the upcoming year.She said: “I’m there, as you can imagine, saying, ‘Can you tell me a bit more about Charles's relationship with Harry? Do you think Harry and Meghan will come to the coronation?’"She added: “I get stonewalled most of the time, this is the irony of all this.“At the time of negative publicity, do you know what the Palace press office was doing? They were phoning me and trying to deny most of these stories.”Shocked that the Palace call the press over articles, Camilla admitted they get in touch if they believe something wrong has been written.She continued: “The point is, people are being extremely naive, Harry included, if he thinks that everything comes from the Palace.

Camilla slammed: “Anybody who watched the Oprah interview, as she stared at Meghan telling her about the colour of the skin, interpreted that as a claim that the family were racist.“Harry then says in another breath, ‘Silence is abuse you’ve got to call out interpretations in the press when they’re wrong'.“If he didn’t think that he meant that the Royal Family were racist when the press covered it as racist and William is there having to say, ‘We’re not a racist family’.“Why didn’t they step forward and say, ‘Sorry we didn’t mean they were racist’? They just left it for months.”This Morning continues weekdays on ITV from 10am
