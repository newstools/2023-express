Jake Paul and Tommy Fury had to be separated by security as they went straight at each other in the ring. The pair square off on February 26 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia live on BT Sport Box Office. Both men traded words as they butted heads before being separated by security as Paul lunged for Fury's throat. "He's fought taxi drivers, he has no chin, it's all a joke. I'm ending you February 26, your not built for this moment, it's all fake confidence you can't even knockout a tax driver," shouted Paul. To which, Fury retorted: "I will school you. I was beating better guys than you in the amteurs when I was 14 while you were messing around on the Disney channel. I guarantee if it's the last thing I do in boxing, you are over in four weeks so enjoy the last few weeks as a so cold boxer. "When I hit you on the chin it's all over for you... All I've had for the last few years is 'when are you fighting Jake? You backed out, you're scared'. You had two lucky opportunities to get out of this fight and you should taken them. Mark my words it's all over."  "Tommy has so much to lose, his family is going to disown him when I knock him the f*** out. Sorry Tyson, I love you but it's over for your brother," said Paul in reference to The Gypsy King's promise that he will retire his brother if he loses to the YouTube star.
