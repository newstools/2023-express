Glossybox is known for its subscription boxes, however from time to time the brand releases limited edition boxes that can be purchased by non-subscribers without a commitment. With Valentine's Day just two weeks away, beauty is a great option when it comes to choosing a gift, and it could also be given before the day to help create a Valentine's look.   Although priced at under £40, the box is worth £112 and includes 12 products, with six full-sized and six deluxe-sized items.
