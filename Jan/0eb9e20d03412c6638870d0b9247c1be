Planning a weekend away or short break is always a great way to uplift your mood. The cost of living crisis has resulted in Brits looking for cheaper holidays and Travelodge’s latest sale is the perfect solution. Available now, Travelodge has discounted over two million hotel rooms in its big winter sale. Travellers can now find hotels slashed to £34 or less at over 580 properties, making it perfect for booking a quick getaway. This means that if a family of four booked a room, it would work out to only £8 per person, making it cheaper than a meal out. There’s plenty of hotels to choose from including grade II listed hotels, so be sure to book now. Good news, there’s plenty of time to plan your trips as discounted stays are available from Friday, January 16, 2023 and continue to the rest of the year. Despite its budget prices, Travelodge offers high-quality service and has recently upgraded 65 of its hotels to its new budget luxe design and recently opened London Wimbledon, Docklands and Hexam. If you’d like to enjoy a Valentine’s Day weekend away or Mother’s Day trip, the Regent Hotel Leamington Spa is a great pick and has been recently updated to a new luxe premium look, for budget prices. Plus, Queen Victoria famously stayed in room 13 at the hotel. Seaside escapes are always a great idea for family holidays and Travelodge has 36 hotels to pick from on the British Coastline. Popular coastal locations include Blackpool, Brighton, Bournemouth, Scarborough, Southend-on-Sea and Torquay. There’s no need to worry about finding food as over 200 Travelodge hotels feature an on-site restaurant that offers breakfast, dinner and a bar menu. Plus, it serves unlimited hot buffet breakfast from £8.99 and for each paying adult, two kids under 15 eat for free.
