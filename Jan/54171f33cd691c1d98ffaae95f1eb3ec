Ditching EU regulations about lithium – used to power the batteries of electric cars – is expected to give the sector a major boost. Champions of Britain’s lithium industry want the country to mine its own reserves of the vital metal, refine it, and also produce the batteries that electric cars need. It is hoped the UK will supply eight percent of Europe’s refined lithium. The battery industry and supply chain is expected to deliver 100,000 jobs by 2040. The push to make a Britain a “powerhouse in refined lithium” comes as the UK prepares for the end of the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030. There is concern about competition for the critical minerals such as lithium, graphite and cobalt used in batteries. Business minister Nusrat Ghani said in December that “China produced 76 per cent of rare earth elements from 2016 to 2020”. A Government source said: “Our Brexit Freedoms Bill is freeing the country from unnecessary regulation and providing the basis for enormous growth in new sectors. Lithium is a good example of this.”  Tees Valley Lithium plans to build a lithium hydroxide refinery at Teesside Freeport’s Wilton Inter-national Chemical Park. The plant is expected to be the largest in Europe, creating 1,000 jobs. Meanwhile, British Lithium aims to produce battery-grade lithium carbonate from Cornish granite. Chief executive Andrew Smith said: “We have developed our pilot plant in record time and are very happy with how the business is progressing. We estimate full production will start in four years." “There is huge global demand for lithium and the UK needs to have its own domestic supply.” Last year President Joe Biden unveiled a $3billion investment package to boost supplies of lithium-ion batteries. Refinery projects have also been launched in France and Germany.
