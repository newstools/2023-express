Aries You’re still achieving and still pushing to reach your goals and you should be proud of the progress you have made so far. You have an insatiable appetite for challenge and this will amaze someone who has never seen this side of your nature before. Taurus You’re tired of the attitude of a colleague who makes it clear they will do what they have to do and no more. Since they aren’t ever going to change it should be made clear to them that you are no longer supporting them and they should not expect to be rewarded for work they have not done Gemini Once a decision has been made, you won’t be able to change your mind so be sure you are making the right one. There will be a greater need than normal to watch what you say in front of others. Someone is feeling sensitive and vulnerable.                         Cancer Don’t give up on whatever it is you are trying to do. Be prepared to put in time and effort to prove to yourself and to others that you really want to achieve. Trying something for the first time will feel daunting. Even if your original attempt is not met with much enthusiasm from others, you can improve on this. Leo Your dedication to a cause is causing problems at home. It is time to rearrange your priorities. Work you are doing on a voluntary basis is not being acknowledged or appreciated while those at the top are happily taking credit for all that has been done. It might be time to rearrange your priorities. Virgo Be careful as if it is not you, someone may be feeling vulnerable today. Managing emotions will be tricky and to make matters worse, you sense a friend or workmate is hiding the truth about a matter that needs to be addressed as soon as possible.     Libra When you are asked for an opinion, try not to sit on the fence as you so often do. Be positive and be objective. Most of all, allow yourself to think that things will work out for the best and share in other people’s happiness. Scorpio A partner in work or romance is behaving strangely but constant suspicion on your part is not going to help your relationship. It could even create its own problems. Just be sure to discreetly check facts, figures and other information before making a long-term commitment. Sagittarius Positive thinking is all well and good but a little caution thrown in cannot do you any wrong. You don’t want to build your confidence so much that it makes you seem smug. Scale back your expectations just a little to avoid having to face unnecessary disappointment.    Capricorn Others will look to you to take charge of a work or community project. Assuming a position of authority could create a difficult situation when someone will make it known in no uncertain terms that they had expected to be given that opportunity. Aquarius It makes sense to take time out of your schedule for structured play. Taking regular breaks can be exactly what you need to be more productive. Just don’t go off when you feel like it. Make a schedule that includes breaks, and stick to it. Pisces Something isn’t quite right but you can’t work out what it is. The more you try to fill in what’s missing, the more frustrated you become. Instead of focusing on what is going wrong, focus on what is going right and your thoughts will soon start to veer away from if onlys.
