An off-duty policeman saw the Foyle's War star, 43, reversing into a vehicle in her Honda CR-V after a night out with friends. Mathew Howell, prosecuting, said a test showed she had been more than twice the legal drink-drive limit. Weeks, of Byworth, West Sussex, who also appeared in Midsomer Murders, The Ruth Rendell Mysteries and Death In Paradise, admitted drink-driving on November 28. She told Worthing magistrates: "I was expecting to stay the night in a friend's house. "But the man in question invited his lover to the property and I was in danger of being coerced into sexual actions with them, which I found extremely unwelcome." Weeks said she was receiving only Universal Credit at present and no longer living at a centre for people with drug and alcohol problems. The actress made no comment after being banned from driving for 20 months and fined £120 with £85 costs. In 2015, Oxford graduate Weeks was caught speeding with her son in the back, while under a driving ban. She was ordered to wear an electronic tag and observe a nightly curfew for a month. A year later, she disappeared during a stay as a voluntary patient at a care centre near her home. It sparked a police appeal, but the actress was later found safe and well. In 2019, Weeks, who played driver Samantha Stewart in Foyle's War from 2002 to 2015, split from her husband, hypnotherapist Lorne Stormonth-Darling. They wed in 2005.
