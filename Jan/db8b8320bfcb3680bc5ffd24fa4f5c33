Prince Andrew “remains a danger” to the Royal Family’s image, according to a commentator after reports claimed the King closed his Buckingham Palace sleeping quarters Royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams believes the Duke of York, 62, “does not seem inclined to live quietly” despite King Charles’ desire to place him “on the periphery” of the Firm. His remarks follow an insider account suggesting the King, 74, sees the Palace as “no place” for his younger brother. The source claimed Andrew is no longer allowed to sleep in a suite he has enjoyed for many years in the residence. “It is true that he no longer occupies rooms at Buckingham Palace, though this will doubtless be explained away as part of the 10-year renovation of the palace, it is a sign that King Charles and the Prince of Wales are determined that he should in the future be on the periphery of royal life," Mr Fitzwilliams told Fox Digital.  "They are all too aware of the public’s hostility toward him [and] the aura of entitlement… He does not seem inclined to live quietly, privately, possibly to help run the royal estates, which would make sense." Andrew was stripped of his royal and military honours in 2022 after Virginia Giuffre accused him of sexually assaulting her three times when she was 17. Andrew reached an out-of-court settlement with Ms Giuffre in March to stave off a civil court case. The Duke has repeatedly denied the allegations and the undisclosed sum was not an admission of liability.

The Duke of York’s representatives and Buckingham Palace have been approached for comment.
