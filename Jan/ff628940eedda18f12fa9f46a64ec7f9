The 43-year-old, who married Frank in December 2015, is a doting mum to two young children. As well as her own children, Christine has a close bond with her stepdaughters, Isla and Luna, who she has known since they were young. They are Frank's daughters from a previous relationship with model Elen Rivas. The Loose Women panellist rarely shares photos of her two children but took to Instagram on Thursday to share a sweet photo of her youngest child. The first photo showed the couple's three-year-old daughter, Patricia, playing a game and a glimpse of Freddie, 18 months. The presenter only showed the backs of their toddler's heads, showing the brother and sister's striking curls. A second photo was of Freddie on his own as his mum Christine gushed over her baby boy's growing tresses, telling her 637,000 followers: "The curls are getting curlier." Frank was quick to react as he was one of the 10,000 followers who liked the post.
