Speaking on behalf of FairBettingSites, body language expert Darren Stanton has analysed the Duke of Sussex followig his latest interview with Michael Strahan. Mr Stanton said: “When Harry talks about Camilla, he does not show the same open hand gestures as when he talks about other members of his family. “This shows he clearly does not love her the same way he does other members despite him saying he loves all his family. He clearly holds Camilla responsible towards the break-up of his mother and father.” He added: “He also later says he did not want them to be married, but he did give his blessing for them to be together, so we see a break in the pattern of non-verbal responses which is significant. “We call these differences red flags that tell me he feels very differently towards Camilla versus his brother and father.” FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
