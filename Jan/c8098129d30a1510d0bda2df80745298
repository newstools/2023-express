Death in Paradise season 12, episode four, will see DS Naomi Thomas (played by Shantol Jackson) venture to her home island of Saint Barnabas for her best friend's wedding. Soon after Monique Hays (Gia Re) walks down the aisle to meet her soon-to-be husband, the church doors open. Standing in the doorway is Monique's estranged mum Odette Hayes (Nicola Alexis), who causes a commotion as she left her family 15 years ago. This is far from the first time actress Alexis has appeared in a popular drama though.

She starred in the show for a year back in 2002 and was fresh from Hendon, having only graduated nine months prior to joining Sun Hill. Ruby had a good attitude towards policing and was eager to do her best but her downfall came when PC David Kent (Todd Carty) got involved. She bought a knock off Walkman from an old school friend and knowing there was no evidence, he threw a box of goods at the suspect, forcing him to handle it. The case went to court and David forced Ruby to lie under oath and commit perjury. The trial went through but she couldn't deal with the fact she lied and so resigned from the force shortly after. The Bill isn't the only show that Alexis has featured in either during her career. She has also made appearances in Dangerfield, Absolute Power, Doctors, Fleabag, The Girl Before and DI Ray.
