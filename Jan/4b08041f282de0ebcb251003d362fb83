Alvaro Morata has provided an update on his wife, Alice Campello after she was left in intensive care after giving birth to their fourth child earlier this week. Campello had to receive specialist care at Madrid's University Hospital of Navarra, leaving the Atletico Madrid forward 'scared'. Morata revealed with a post on Tuesday that Campello has given birth to Bella, accompanied by an adorable image of the baby sleeping in pink and white pyjamas. But he added that the model-turned-businesswoman had suffered 'complications', leaving her in the ICU. Morata wrote: "Yesterday Bella was born, and it's just like we dreamed it would be. Mom, unfortunately, after the childbirth that went very well, she had some complications that made us very scared. "Alice is strong and recovering little by little. Now she is in the intensive care of Clinica Universidad de Navarra, and she is being taken care of by wonderful doctors. We will never stop thanking them for the affection they have given us at all times, for their professionalism, for never making us feel alone... I can only estimate them immensely. We hug you and thank you for all the messages and the beautiful words you wrote to us worried. Will keep you posted."
