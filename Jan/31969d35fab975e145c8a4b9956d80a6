The return of Jon Jones to the UFC is arguably the most highly-anticipated in combat sports, and we could be just weeks ago from seeing it happen. One of the greatest fighters in the history of the UFC, Jones has dominated the light-heavyweight category since he arrived in 2008 - winning 20 fights and losing one, controversially coming by way of disqualification, with many not counting the loss on his record. Jones has spent time away from the octagon in recent years. But for the past 18 months, Jones has been training his body to make the adjustment from light heavyweight to heavyweight - a whopping 50lb difference. Jones, who usually fights at 205lbs, is now walking around at 160lbs, in his preparation to return to the sport that he has helped grow, ahead of his exciting debut at heavyweight, which has been confirmed to be in the first quarter of this year. UFC president Dana White has been keen to make a fight happen, ideally wanting heavyweight champion Francis Ngannou to be ready, with Jones to be awarded a title fight in his first ever bout at the weight. But with nothing developing, and Ngannou's current status unknown, another potential opponent has emerged - arguably the most dangerous fighter in the division. Ciryl Gane has called out Jones for a fight at UFC 285 at Las Vegas in March, in a tweet with some reporting that a fight could be in the works. Gane tweeted: "Where you at @JonnyBones. I'm free this March, Vegas." Gane has not fought since his highly impressive victory over Tai Tuivasa, in his home country France this past August. Gane has lost just once in the UFC, which came last January in an awkward bout against current champion Ngannou. But the Cameroonian has remained sidelined from the fight, after suffering a serius knee injury. If Ngannou is still not able to fight anytime soon, Gane would seemingly be the next man up for Jones, with both men looking to make a statement, before challenging the champion.
