RAC Fuel Watch data shows petrol fell by 8.4p last month to 151.06p making a full 55-litre tank for a family car £4.63 cheaper (£83.08). Diesel came down by 9.4p to 173.97p meaning a complete fill-up was £5.19 less than it was at the start of the month at £95.68. Unleaded bought at one of the big four supermarkets reduced by 10p a litre from an average of 157.86p to 147.76p and diesel by 11.4p from 181.66p to 170.23p. Drivers and experts have continually highlighted the widening gap between the price of petrol and diesel, which is now to an unprecedented 23p. Many tradespeople are being held to ransom by diesel costs, given the ongoing cost of living crisis and the slower fall in price compared to petrol. Wholesale prices, which have fallen considerably since mid-October, remained largely unchanged with petrol averaging 106p a litre throughout December while diesel was 123.4p.

For diesel drivers the figure should be nearer to 160p a litre – 14p lower than the average at the end of 2022. Simon Williams, RAC fuel spokesperson, said it was positive that price cuts were being made, but that drivers were still being unfairly hit with unnecessarily high costs. He added: “On the face of it, December looks like it was a good month for drivers with 9p coming off at the pumps on top of November’s 6p, but there’s no question that the drop should have been far bigger given how far wholesale prices have come down.

Another supermarket, Morrisons, is helping its customers save money on fuel by offering 5p off every litre at the pumps this January. All customers that spend £35 in store between Thursday, January 5, and Sunday, January 15, will receive a coupon. Mr Williams continued, saying: “Looking at prices in Northern Ireland is a good reference for what should be happening across the rest of the UK as petrol was 4.5p cheaper there than the UK average at the start of December but was nearly 7p lower at the end of the month at just 144.43p. “For diesel the difference is even more pronounced as a litre was 7p cheaper at the beginning of December and 9.5p less by the close at 164.55p. “If fuel can be sold this cheaply in Northern Ireland, then this must mean something is very wrong with fuel retailing in mainland UK.” In Europe prices are also considerably cheaper as the average price of a litre of unleaded is 144p and diesel 152p. Just across the Channel in France unleaded is an average of 146p and diesel 154p. In fact, when compared to the 27 EU countries we currently have the second most expensive diesel and the sixth most expensive petrol.
