Happy New Year, and happy new transfer window, with the beginning of January bringing Manchester United supporters hope that they will finally sign a striker. Erik ten Hag’s side looked starved of a No 9 once again on Saturday afternoon in their 1-0 victory over Wolves. Marcus Rashford scored the all-important goal on a day, which glossed over what was an underwhelming display by the team overall. United struggled to link up in the final third at the Molineux Stadium, with Ten Hag’s forwards all struggling to make their presence known. Cody Gakpo was a well-known target heading into January but he has ended up joining Liverpool instead. Internal discussions are ongoing about whether to pursue Marco Asensio or Joao Felix, who is desperate to leave Atletico Madrid. More traditional No 9’s are also being explored, with Marcus Thuram the latest to be linked with a move to Old Trafford, and he certainly won’t be the last.
