Some £15billion is wasted in unclaimed benefits every year as millions of people miss out on money they are entitled to during the worst cost of living crisis since the 1950s. What's more, benefits like PIP are a gateway to other financial help in the form of 'freebie benefits' from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) which could be worth more than £10,000 in additional fnancial support. Britons, who rely on PIP because they have a health condition or disability that affects their everyday lives, are struggling to pay soaring energy bills and food prices. Rising inflation hits those on the lowest incomes the hardest, but some are missing out on financial support that could help to ease financial pressures. Thousands of Britons are losing out on PIP which is not means tested so can be claimed even if people are working. Furthermore, Express.co.uk has found at least 10 freebie benefits that people may be eligible for if they are successfully claiming benefits like PIP or pension credit.

The disability payment’s daily living component pays a lower weekly rate of £61.85 and a higher rate of £92.40. The mobility component works out at £24.45 a week for the lower rate and £64.50 for the higher rate. PIP claimants who qualify for the higher weekly rates of both components would receive £627.60 a month.  Unfortunately, PIP claimants won't automatically qualify for the Warm Home Discount, which has this year risen from £140 to £150. To qualify for the discount this year, Britons need to be on means-tested benefits and the property they live in must have a "high energy cost score based on its characteristics". That means those in smaller properties may no longer qualify for the first time in years. People can check if they are eligible for a discount by using the eligibility checker on the GOV.UK website.
