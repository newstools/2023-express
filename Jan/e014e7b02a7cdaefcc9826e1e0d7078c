A US Navy plane has crashed in a horrific incident, with two pilots injured. A spokesperson from NAS Whiting Field confirmed the plane is one of their Training Air Wing Five's T-6B aircrafts. Two parachutes were reported but the condition of the pilots was originally unknown. As of 6.30pm GMT, The Baldwin County Sheriff’s Office confirmed that both pilots were rescued and taken to a local hospital for treatment. The pilots were found in an area away from the crash site, one of several scenes being investigated. “Two pilots had to eject, parachutes deployed,” said Baldwin County Sheriff Hoss Mack. “Pilots do not have serious injuries but are being taken to be evaluated.”  Two black boxes were found along with plane debris in a local’s yard. The incident took place between County Road 87 and Allen Road in Robertsdale, Alabama. No other injuries have been reported at this time, and the cause of the incident is under investigation, according to a public affairs officer with NAS Whiting Field. Naval Air Station Whiting Field is a US Navy base located near Milton, Florida. In October 23, 2020, a Navy T-6B aircraft also crashed in the area. In that incident, in which the training plane crashed into a residential neighbourhood near Foley, a student pilot and an instructor pilot were killed. It comes as four people were killed in a plane crash in Lavaca County, Texas. The state’s DPS confirmed the fatalities occurred at around 11am local time when the small plane crashed near CR 462 and FM 318 in Lavaca County. The Yoakum Municipal Airport is within a mile of where the plane crashed. One person is hurt and was taken to a hospital in Victoria.
