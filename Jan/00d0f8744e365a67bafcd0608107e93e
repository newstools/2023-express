Meghan Markle is reportedly planning to write her own bombshell memoir in what could be a fresh onslaught on the Royal Family. The Duke of Sussex's tell-all book Spare - which has promised "raw, unflinching honesty" - is out later this month. And Meghan is reportedly following in her husband's footsteps with a memoir of her own. According to one source, the Duchess of Sussex is "contemplating getting entirely candid about her time in the royal limelight" and "fully intends to write this book and leave no stone unturned". A Hollywood agent told The Mail on Sunday: "I would find it surprising if Meghan didn't publish her own story, to be honest. Spare is clearly Prince Harry's chance to tell his, but hers is equally compelling. I mean, how many actresses end up marrying a Prince?" The Montecito-based couple, who recently released their explosive Netflix series, reportedly signed a four-book deal with publishers Penguin Random House in 2021. Meghan has already released children's book The Bench and the pair, who quit royal duties in 2020, are rumoured to be working on a wellness tome. A representative for the Duchess has been contacted for comment. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES ON THE ROYAL FAMILY:
