The prankster behind the sexual noises played on BBC's coverage of Wolves vs Liverpool in the FA Cup has revealed himself as Youtuber 'Jarvo69'. The broadcaster has offered an official apology for the incident which quickly went viral. Gary Lineker and co were left baffled as the noises began minutes after the pre-match coverage had got underway. They continued on repeat for the duration with no member of the BBC studio able to find where the noises were coming from. They were later revealed by Lineker to be coming from an old mobile phone with youtube 'Jarvo69' taking responsibility for it in a video on his page as he showed himself playing the noises. He also released a video on Twitter showing him in the studio earlier that day. The BBC press office has released a statement apologising for what happened, confirming they will launch a full investigation. A BBC spokesperson said: “We apologise to any viewers offended during the live coverage of the football this evening.

He has taken part in pitch invasions at the cricket, rugby and Champions League final in a series of stunts that have brought him a substantial online following. The YouTuber appears to have hidden a mobile phone somewhere in the studio with Lineker revealing the device behind the prank on Twitter after it was found once the focus turned to the match action. Posting a picture of the phone, he wrote: "Well, we found this taped to the back of the set. As sabotage goes it was quite amusing." The sexual sound clip has been regularly used on social media in the last decade, usually placed towards the end of largely mundane videos as users look to prank their friends and followers who are listening aloud and often in public places but this is the first time that it has been heard on national television.

The quartet struggled to contain their laughter as they tried to remain professional despite the unusual situation they found themselves in. The two former England strikers then tried to take advantage of the situation to get in pranks of their own, each trying to place the blame on Murphy. First Lineker said: "Will you stop making those noises Danny?" before Shearer took the opportunity of the stadium lights briefly going off to make a light-hearted gag at Murphy's expense. The Newcastle legend joked: "Floodlights going off, Danny Murphy's phone going off in the studio, what else can happen?" It remains to be seen what the outcome of the BBC investigation will be while Jarvo has promised to reveal the full story behind the prank on his YouTube page at a later date.
