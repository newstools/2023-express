The opening Grand Slam of the campaign is set to kick off, with the Australian Open right around the corner. The world’s best tennis players will all be heading to Melbourne later this month, with the opening round of the tournament kicking off on January 16.  One man who makes his return to the event is two-time champion Novak Djokovic, who dramatically missed last year’s event. After being crowned champion in 2021, Djokovic was unable to defend his title after being deported from Melbourne. This came after the Serbian star failed to get vaccinated against Covid-19, breaking tournament rules and Australian law, leading to his deportation after initially being placed in isolation. One year on though, Djokovic is now back to compete. The Djokovic saga no doubt split opinion in the world of tennis 12 months ago. Ahead of this month’s tournament though, the Serbian is hoping he still has the support of the Aussie locals. He said: “Over the years I’ve been really fortunate to start very strong in Australia and I love playing there.  “After obviously what happened earlier this year, hopefully I can have a decent reception there and hopefully that can help me play some good tennis.” Djokovic will no doubt be keen to make up for lost time in 2023, starting from the very beginning of the tournament, and will no doubt have his eyes on the upcoming tournament draw. Here are all the details you need to know in regard to this month’s draw. The draw for this year’s Australian Open draw in Melbourne will take place on Thursday, January 12 at the Margaret Court Arena.  At the time of writing it currently remains unknown as to what time the draw begins. At the 2022 event, the draw took place at 4am UK time, 3pm local time. Tennis fans wanting to watch the Australian Open draw can tune in to the tournament’s official YouTube channel, where a stream will be broadcasted.
