A homeowner has slammed a furniture company after a botched delivery punched holes in his £500k property and left his new sofa jammed on the stairs. Luke Ansell, 27, recently ordered a sofa to deck out his new home a month after moving into the Bournemouth residence. But a delivery crew left the brand-new £2,000 sofa from designersofas4u.co.uk lodged in his staircase. The sofa was delivered on January 19 by two men who insisted they made tight deliveries "all the time", Mr Ansell said. But they struggled to get the sofa up his narrow staircase and later abandoned it there. Photographs shared by Mr Ansell show the trail of disaster the pair left behind. One picture from the base of the staircase shows the sofa broken out of its plastic packaging while resting against a wall.

In the second picture, the couch is visibly stuck between the bannister and ceiling and partially embedded in the wall. The picture shows the attempted delivery has etched long, deep scratches into the surrounding wall. The photos show Mr Ansell was ultimately able to move the sofa, but he also uncovers additional damage. One of the walls on his staircase now has a triangular hole punched in, with paintwork crumbling inside. The deep hole shows the damage done to both the plaster and woodwork as workers crammed the sofa into the small entryway. Scratches lead up to the top of the stairs, with dust tracks also coating the staircase. Express.co.uk has contacted Designer Sofas For You for comment.
