A furious Toby Carvery customer had to "wait two hours" for their main course after the restaurant "ran out of meat". The diner says they were in the middle of eating their starter at around 3.10pm when the staff told them there was no meat left.  It meant their main course was not served until 5.10pm. The experience at The Plough, in Endon, Stoke-on-Trent, has resulted in a head office complaint, reports StokeonTrentLive. It comes as diners and community leaders are calling for the venue to get a facelift both internally and externally. Toby Carvery has previously responded by promising customers an "enhanced experience" at the under-fire pub and restaurant.  The diner left their fuming review on TripAdvisor. They have described their visit over the festive period as an "absolute disgrace" and gave it a score of one star out of five. The reviewer states: "We arrived on Boxing Day at 3pm and were served our starters - only then to be told that there was no meat available for the carvery. We were asked to wait for the next sitting. Finally at 5.10pm we were offered food. "It was absolutely atrocious and we were then expected to pay the full bill. The desserts were extremely poor and cold. I have now contacted head office as this is just not acceptable." Toby Carvery is aware of the complaint made by the diner. The venue said: "We are disappointed to hear that you are not satisfied with your visit. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We will use your comments to refine our efforts to ensure this issue does not happen again." Toby Carvery is a British carvery chain with 158 restaurants owned and operated by Mitchells & Butlers.
