Drivers have been urged to use a little-known gear-changing technique to boost their car's fuel efficiency and save money on petrol and diesel. By using the highest gear possible within the speed limit, drivers can boost their fuel economy. Excessive speed is the biggest fuel-guzzling factor, with drivers being urged to have a light right foot. This will ensure all acceleration is gentle, which is very important to fuel-efficient driving. One of the best ways to achieve a high mph is by driving in the highest possible gear for the vehicle while keeping within the speed limit. In urban areas, drivers are advised to change up through the gears as quickly as they can with the lowest revs possible.

Mark Akbar, Managing Director at CarStore, urged drivers to monitor how they use their gears, as this could save money. He said: “It's not part of the driving test to learn how to use your gears efficiently, you simply have to be able to use them to get the car to move at various speeds. “However, to make the most out of every drop of fuel and maintain maximum efficiency, it's vital that you're always using the right gear at the right time.

The speed of 56mph has often been talked about as being the optimum speed. This was due to the old fuel consumption test being run at three speeds: urban, 56mph and 75mph – and 56mph was always, unsurprisingly, the most efficient of these. Typically, cars are most efficient at 45-50mph.  By driving aggressively and applying brakes suddenly, drivers can burn up to 20 percent more fuel. The current RAC Fuel Watch indicates that drivers will have to pay 165.77p per litre of unleaded. The situation is even worse for diesel car owners who will have to fork out 190.23p per litre on average. The price of petrol is expected to stay the same, while the price of diesel is likely to rise even further.
