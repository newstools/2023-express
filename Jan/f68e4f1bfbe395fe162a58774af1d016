BBC Breakfast was met with a backlash from viewers over the increased coverage of Prince Harry memoir, with many claiming it was being given too much "attention" and labelling the broadcaster as "utterly pathetic". Ahead of the release of Spare, which is set to hit shelves next week, leaked extracts have been shared by the Guardian. BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell detailed his thoughts on the leaked extracts to host Ben Thompson. "There is no comment from Kensington Palace," he made clear. "I suspect that will be the position throughout today and throughout the coming days. "The second thing to say is the BBC hasn't seen an actual copy of this book, but it's absolutely clear The Guardian's correspondent in New York has got a copy of the book despite the very tight security."

Referring to the alleged altercation between Harry and William, he commented: "As we all know, family disagreements occur, they are best settled in private. "But as you say, this book, it would appear, is full of specific details of the collapse of this relationship." Some viewers slammed Nicholas' take on the reported incident and took to Twitter to complain about the coverage. Twitter user @HughEdw31897368 wrote: "This is utterly pathetic.
