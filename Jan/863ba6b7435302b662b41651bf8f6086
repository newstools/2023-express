Soaring energy bills and rising food prices made life difficult for many in 2022 as Britons struggled to make ends meet during the cost of living crisis. However, the new year is the perfect time to start a new savings habit to put some extra cash away for increasing bills, emergencies or even the odd treat. There are several money saving challenges doing the rounds on social media giving people plenty of choice in terms of which one is better for them, depending on how much they have left over after paying for essentials.  Money saving challenges are always popular at this time of year and could leave people hundreds or thousands of pounds better off by the end of 2023. People can start saving from just one pence on the first day and can choose to put the money away into jars, envelopes or savings accounts. Anyone taking part in the 1p Savings Challenge will have £667.95 at the end of 12 months if they stick to it every single day. For those feeling a bit more flush, the £5 savings challenge will leave people almost £7,000 better off by the end of the year.
