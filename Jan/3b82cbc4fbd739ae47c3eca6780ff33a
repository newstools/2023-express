Chelsea supporters have already had a gripping month but things could shift into an entirely different gear now that deadline day has arrived. Manager Graham Potter claimed earlier in January that he did not expect much more business to be done, but co-owner Todd Boehly seemingly has different ideas and he could continue his blowout in the coming hours. Deals for Mykhaylo Mudryk, Benoit Badiashile, Noni Madueke, Malo Gusto, Andrey Santos, David Datro Fofana and Joao Felix would be enough for most teams, but the Blues hierarchy are on a mission to compete with the Premier League's big guns, and they seem to be in a hurry about it. Sagas involving Argentina star Enzo Fernandez and Brighton midfielder Moises Caicedo will be decided one way or the other over the course of the day. Fernandez would command a British record fee if they see the deal through, while convincing the Seagulls to finally cash in on their Ecuadorian ace would be an incredible feat in itself. As Chelsea fans wait patiently to discover whether those working behind the scenes have done enough, follow Express Sport's live transfer updates below...
