Salma Hayek, 56, has been busy in recent weeks alongside Channing Tatum, 42, as the pair promote their latest venture, Magic Mike's Last Dance. The two decided to close out their journey on the film together by experiencing the real thing, the Magic Mike Live tour, which made a stop in Miami. Salma shared a short video on Instagram of the evening, in which she and her pals, including Channing, could be seen partying the night away while watching the hunky performers. The Hollywood paired a hot pink tie-up shirt with a plunging lace corset top underneath, exposing her ample assets. Salma paired this with black wide-legged pants featuring a hip cut-out, and styled her dark tresses in their usual straight look.
