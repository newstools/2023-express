It will comprise events unimaginable in 1953 and which simply have no formal part in the ancient ritual of anointing the new monarch, by the Grace of God, Defender of the Faith. The programme has the King’s fingerprints all over it. “Inclusion” is the sub-heading and popular appeal is at the top of the agenda. According to the Palace, it will be a “solemn religious service, as well as an occasion for celebration and pageantry”. The fun begins with a huge showbusiness production at Windsor Castle featuring “global music icons and contemporary stars”, broadcast live by the BBC, backed by a “world-class orchestra” playing musical favourites, chosen no doubt by the King, who prides himself on his refined musical taste. The Coronation Choir, a diverse group of various ethnicities, will have a starring role, with people from all parts of British society and the Commonwealth receiving free tickets. His mother’s coronation was very much the last trump of the British Empire but Charles’s event will be a celebration of 21st century togetherness, tradition, culture and love of crown and country. The intended message is clear: a modern monarchy can meet changing times by adapting to them without sacrificing its innate mystery or majesty as one reign succeeds another.
