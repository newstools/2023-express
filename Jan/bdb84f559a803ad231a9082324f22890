The Golden Globes returned for 2023 in style after the ceremony was shrouded in controversy last year, when it was turned into a "private event" by its organisers, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), after they faced backlash over a lack of black members. Despite the scaled-down event last year, the stars made a jaw-dropping return to the red carpet last night in Beverly Hills, California. Halloween actress Jamie Lee Curtis, 64, looked elegant in a regal, floor-length black gown featuring a show-stopping lace cape as she took to the red carpet with a beaming smile. Bond girl Ana de Armas stunned in an eye-popping monochromatic sleeveless gown with a diamante-embellished geometrical pattern, which she paired with a diamond-encrusted bracelet. America's Got Talent judge Heidi Klum, 49, showed off her incredibly toned legs as she posed for pictures alongside husband Tom Kaulitz, 33, in a glitzy silver sequinned dress and matching heels. The star-studded ceremony saw Game of Thrones spin-off House of the Dragon and HBO's White Lotus achieving top prizes. Austin Butler, 31, won a gong for his performance as Elvis Presley in the Baz Luhrmann biopic, while Michelle Yeoh, 60, won the Best Actress award for Everything Everywhere All at Once.
