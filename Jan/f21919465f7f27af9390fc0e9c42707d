Thanks to the multiple leaks of his long-awaited memoir, “Spare”, I now know how Harry lost his virginity, how sore his todger was when he got frostbite, how jealous he was of his brother and how mentally scarred he quite understandably is by his mother’s tragic death. But when it came to the oft-repeated (and hotly disputed) row over a bridesmaid’s dress and then hurt feelings over whether William’s wife, Catherine, should lend Meghan her lip gloss, even I found myself mouthing “Harry, shut up!” I don’t really care who was right or wrong. I don’t care that Harry and Meghan were upset they had to shop in Ikea when William and Catherine had classier stuff in their Kensington Palace apartment.And I don’t care Harry felt that it was unfair he was given a smaller bedroom than his brother in his grandmother’s magnificent castle in Scotland.To carry a lifelong chip on your shoulder because you were born the second child is, quite frankly, ludicrous.The only positive note to come out of this sorry tale of woe is that, for the first time, we have heard Harry say he wants his father and his brother back.That’s encouraging, even though he has accused Charles and William of rebuffing his attempts at reconciliation.Harry, it would seem, wants an apology. Only then will he consider if he will attend one of the most important events in his father’s life: the Coronation. Harry unbridled is proving both petty-minded and dangerous. Controlling his own narrative, without guidance or advice, is a risky game.He is, it seems to me, now a man riddled with internal conflict and confusion.Last year, on a visit to the UK, he called in on his grandmother, the Queen. He wanted, he said, to “make sure she had the right people around her”.How ironic that now seems. Because we really need to know who is “around” Harry.From the evidence of his book and endless round of interviews, this troubled Prince badly needs a safe pair of hands nearby.
