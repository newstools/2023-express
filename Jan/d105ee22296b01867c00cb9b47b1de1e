A mum has had an absolutely amazing start to her 2023 after winning £30K from a lottery ticket. Beth Guest, 40, was a winner in the People's Postcode Lottery - weeks after she almost cancelled her ticket. Beth, from Dursley, Gloucestershire, runs a playgroup which she set up while on maternity leave. She won the money when GL11 6HA was announced as a winner on New Year's Eve. Mum-of-two Beth told GloucestershireLive: “I’m gobsmacked. This is really good news. "I never thought I would win in a million years. I nearly cancelled my ticket a few weeks ago – I’m glad I didn’t now!” Beth added: “This has come at the right time and will help a lot. It’ll help me finish the house. "I got the kitchen done but the appliances are all second hand so it will be nice to upgrade them. I run a playgroup for the local community. I set the group up while I was on maternity leave with my second son and there are some bits I’ve had my eye on that I’ve wanted to buy for a while so it’ll be nice to get that.”   Beth said she would celebrate with a hot chocolate as she was 'in disbelief' and described the situation as surreal. Beth was the only person playing with the winning postcode, but had anyone else been then they also would have won £30,000. Postcode Lottery ambassador Matt Johnson presented Beth with her prize. He said: “What a lovely way to end 2022 - a massive congratulations to Beth and her family!” People’s Postcode Lottery costs £10 a month to play and there are guaranteed winners every day.
