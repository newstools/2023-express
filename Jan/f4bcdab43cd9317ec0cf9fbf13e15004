There are just six days of the January transfer window remaining and many clubs from across the Premier League and elsewhere are starting to wrap up their business in the mid-season market. The likes of Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester United have already welcomed some new faces over the last few weeks but could still be poised to add further quality to their ranks before the all-important deadline at the end of this month. Chelsea have spent over Â£150million on player recruitment in January alone but are said to be considering a late swoop for Sporting full-back Pedro Porro, who is also believed to be a priority target for Tottenham. The north Londoners have been in talks regarding a move for Porro in recent days but now seemingly face the possibility of seeing their plans wrecked by Chelsea if the Blues decide to firm up their interest between now and the end of the window. Arsenal, meanwhile, are thought to be chasing a move for Real Valladolid youngster Ivan Fresneda and could be set to make him their third winter signing after the recent arrivals of Leandro Trossard and Jakub Kiwior. United have also been linked with a handful of big-name players since bringing in Wout Weghorst on loan from Burnley earlier this month, although it remains to be seen if the Red Devils will act to make further improvements to their squad before the window slams shut.
