There are only days remaining until the January transfer window slams shut, with a whole host of Premier League clubs frantically working on deals to sign new players. Chelsea have shelled out huge sums of cash this month to bolster their squad, while the likes of Manchester United, Arsenal and Tottenham have also made improvements. Arsenal have stormed to the top of the Premier League table after winning 16 of their 19 matches and will be hoping to get their hands on their first title since 2004 in May. On Monday, the Gunners secured the signing of Poland defender Jakub Kiwior from Serie A side Spezia for £17.6million. Across north London, Tottenham completed their first signing of the window on Wednesday as they snapped up Villarreal winger Arnaut Danjuma on loan. Chelsea, meanwhile, have already splashed out £87m to sign Mykhaylo Mudryk, while also bringing in defender Benoit Badiashile, winger Noni Madueke, midfielder Andrey Santos and strikers Joao Felix and David Fofana as owner Todd Boehly flexes his financial clout. And earlier this month Manchester United signed Wout Weghorst and Jack Butland on loan. The final days of the transfer window are likely to be intense as clubs attempt to get late deals over the line.
