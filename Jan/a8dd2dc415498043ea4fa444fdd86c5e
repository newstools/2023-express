A student has denied threatening behaviour after he allegedly threw eggs at King Charles during a visit to York. Patrick Thelwell, 23, appeared at York Magistrates Court on Friday charged with a Section 4 public order offence relating to the incident on November 9. Wearing a top that exposed his midriff, Thelwell, 23, also pleaded not guilty to using threatening or abusive words or behaviour. His defence argued that Thelwell see's the actions as "necessary" and "part of protest against the establishment". The defendant entered court wearing a top that exposed his midriff to enter his pleas. His solicitor, Nicola Hall,  said the issues at trial would include whether his actions "were part of legitimate protest" and whether they "looked likely to cause fear of unlawful violence". Senior District Judge Paul Goldspring released Thelwell on undconditional bail. A trial was set for April 14 at York Magistrates Court. The incident occured during a walk about by King Charles and Camilla, Queen Consort in York to unveil a stature of the late Queen at York Minster. The King and Queen arrived to a welcome by local digitaries when four eggs were thrown, all of which missed. Security quickly ushered them away.
