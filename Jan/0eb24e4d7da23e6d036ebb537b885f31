Simon Cowell, 63, was pictured leaving the Britain's Got Talent auditions at the London Palladium on Tuesday evening. The media mogul continued to show off the results of his reported three stone weight loss, wearing a dark grey t-shirt with black trousers and his signature aviator sunglasses. He looked in good spirits as he headed home in a car following the 2023 launch of the ITV talent show. Simon's appearance has been a hot topic over the last few months since he ditched his unhealthy lifestyle following a fall at his home in 2017. He also says that he no longer uses Botox and fillers. He told The Sun: "There was a phase where everyone was having their faces pumped full of this and the other. “I saw a picture of me from ‘before’ the other day, and didn't recognise it as me first of all...Enough was enough. There is no filler in my face at all now. Zero."
