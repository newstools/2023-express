Charles and William had a strained relationship for years but have united in a common cause since the departure of Harry and Meghan to California, Prince Andrew’s scandals and the death of the Queen. But now the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are slowly driving a wedge between them and it could spell trouble. The King reportedly wants to invite Harry and Meghan to his Coronation in May, believing their absence would be a greater distraction than their presence. Understandably William is concerned that his brother will stage a “stunt” that would overshadow the event, and at the very least give him more material for books and TV deals. I have to say I tend to agree with William and fear Harry and Meghan are very cleverly pitting the King and his heir against each other. Charles is said to have asked the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, said to be close to the Sussexes, to broker a deal. But I’m not sure we need priests, however well-meaning, involved in this family feud. Personally, I don’t believe the accuracy of a recent poll which showed a majority in favour of the west-coast whingers coming to the big day. Everyone I meet wants them stripped of their titles and banished from the royal orbit for good. If the King cut them adrift from the institution, while welcoming them to private family occasions, I’m sure the public would back him to the hilt. But I fear he will continue to tread softly, perhaps inspired by his mother’s example, and hope the Sussex campaign of vilifying the monarchy, the press and the public peters out. I’m told by good sources that William is “deeply hurt” by Harry washing so much dirty linen in public. But Charles has pleaded with both sons not to make his last years a “misery” and would still like a reconciliation. Is Charles wise or weak? And is William cautious or stubborn? Opinion will be divided but they need to agree on a strategy – and fast.
