The online world is now such a critical part of our lives, particularly after the pandemic, that it cannot be ignored. The Bill will require the social media platforms and search engines to put in place the systems and processes so that they have to think about safety, right at the start of their whole design process. The Bill sets out clear protections against illegal content, such as terrorism or child sexual exploitation material, but we all know there are lots of things online that might not be illegal but are deeply harmful to those who read them. When I was an MP, I got a significant amount of online abuse and threats. It does affect your confidence. We're all conscious that there is content out there that is not healthy. It might be promoting self-harm or eating disorders, it might be anti-Semitic or even violent misogynistic content. No parent or Parliamentarian can want to allow this type of content to continue to flourish unchecked. Weâ€™ve now got the opportunity to ensure the platforms take responsibility for what is being posted online. A lot of these online platforms grew so quickly. Inevitably, it will always take Governments quite a long time to work out how to regulate effectively. It's the same principles as the Health and Safety at Work legislation, which we now take for granted, but at the time it was probably quite ground-breaking. The UK, when we get this bill passed, will be a world leader in online safety regulation. I think a specific Code of Practice, that Ofcom has to pulish and the platforms have to comply with will demonstrate that the Government takes violence against women and girls, and making their online experiences safer, very seriously.
