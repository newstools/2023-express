A man, described as an "extremely dangerous" individual by police has been found guilty of raping a woman while she slept. Marcelle DaCosta,Â 36, of West End Avenue, Leyton, was found guilty of rape after he attacked a woman after she fell asleep at a party. During a trial at Wood Green Crown Court the jury heard that the victim, a woman in her 20s left a party with DaCosta and two others in February 2021 before visiting another residence in Enfield, London. The court heard that the woman attempted to leave the parties twice. In the early hours of the morning, the woman fell asleep and DaCosta raped her. Several days later she reported the attack to police. DaCosta was arrested in 2021 on suspicion of rape. He was subsequently charged in December 2021. Following the unanimous guilty verdict, Detective Sergeant Myles Bossman from the North Area Public Protection team of the Met Police, who led the investigation branded DaCosta an "extremely dangerous" individual who shows no remorse for his actions. In a statement Detective Bossman added: "In what can only be described as predatory, he subjected a woman scarcely known to him to serious sexual assault without any remorse for his actions. "The victim was at her most vulnerable as she slept. "The verdict shows that such violence against women will not be tolerated." He went on to credit the woman for her "bravery and strength" in coming forward. "I hope the conviction goes some way to providing closure after what must have been a shocking experience", he added. The Met is encouraging anyone who is a victim or witness to sexual assault to come forward. Detective Bossman said: "There is zero tolerance for such serious offences. This conviction serves as a reminder that those who commit such horrific offences will be found and justice duly be served." DaCosta is due to be sentenced next month.
