The sudden death of Lisa Marie Presley last week stunned the world, especially after such a busy week in the public eye honouring her father Elvis Presley. Just four days before she died, the 54-year-old made a speech at Graceland to celebrate what would have been The King’s 88th birthday. She then flew back to Los Angeles for a party with Elvis movie star Austin Butler and director Baz Luhrmann. A day later she attended the Golden Globe Awards in support of the film’s nominations, alongside her mother Priscilla Presley and Memphis Mafia member Jerry Schilling. The man who played her father shared his love for her as he won the Best Drama Actor award, yet tragically within a couple of days she’d suffered a cardiac arrest and died. Among those paying tribute to Lisa Marie, who will be buried at Graceland by Elvis and her son Benjamin – who died in 2020 – was Linda Thompson. The King’s old flame lived with him at Graceland from 1972-6 after his marriage fell apart. During those years the 22-year-old Miss Tennessee model helped raise Lisa Marie when she stayed at the mansion during her school holidays. The 72-year-old has since posted pictures on her Instagram with Elvis and his daughter, admitting after her death: “My heart is too heavy for words…” But now she’s broken her silence. Linda shared a picture of Lisa Marie with her mother Priscilla and daughters Riley Keough and Harper and Finley Lockwood. The snap was taken around the release of the Elvis movie last summer when the five Presley women gave their hands and footprints in the late star’s honour, to go outside Hollywood’s famous Chinese theatre.
