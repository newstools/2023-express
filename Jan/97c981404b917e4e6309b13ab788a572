Evacuation orders and avalanche warnings have been issued as a severe storm lashes America's West Coast, prompting flooding, snarling traffic and the closure of highways. The phenomenon is set to cause more misery just days after more than 60 people were killed when "bomb cyclone" Storm Elliott brought sub-zero temperatures and widespread snowfall.  The phenomenon is set to cause more misery just days after more than 60 people were killed when "bomb cyclone" Storm Elliott brought sub-zero temperatures and widespread snowfall. At least one person - a 72-year-old - has died as a result of the latest storm after being struck by a falling tree in California on Saturday afternoon. The Golden State is experiencing the wrath of the storm - described as an "atmospheric river" - this weekend but it is expected to move into the Midwest. The storm is pulling in a long and wide plume of moisture from the Pacific Ocean. The phenomena has been dubbed the "pineapple express" due to how quickly water vapour, which turns to precipitation, is transported from Hawaii to the Golden State. It is set to cross the Rocky Mountains and batter parts of the Midwest as it recover from the devastating winter blast before Christmas. In a respite for middle-America, the current storm would likely be more short lived and less intense. Flooding and rock slides closed portions of roads across Northern California. The California Highway Patrol said a section of US 101 - one of the state's main traffic arteries - was closed south of San Francisco because of flooding. The highway has since been reopened.  In the high Sierra Nevada, as much as two feet (0.6 meters) of snow could accumulate into early Sunday. Avalanche warnings were issued in the backcountry around Lake Tahoe and Mammoth Lakes south of Yosemite. The National Weather Service in Sacramento warned about hazardous driving conditions and posted photos on Twitter showing traffic on snow-covered mountain passes, where vehicles were required to have chains or four-wheel drive.  A Sacramento Municipal Utility District online map showed more than 153,000 customers were affected by power outages on Saturday. "SMUD crews are responding to outages across the region during this powerful winter storm," the utility said in a Twitter message, adding that it was preparing additional resources while working to restore power. “Too many road closures to count at this point,” the weather agency in Sacramento said in an afternoon tweet yesterday. Sacramento County urged residents in the unincorporated community of Wilton to evacuate, warning that flooded roadways could "cut off access to leave the area". Rainfall in downtown San Francisco on Saturday topped five inches (12.7 centimetres) at mid-afternoon, making it the second-wettest day on record, behind a November 1994 deluge. With rain continuing to fall, it could threaten the nearly three-decade old record. Videos on Twitter showed mud-coloured water streaming along San Francisco streets, and a staircase in Oakland turned into a waterfall by heavy rains.

One ski resort south of Lake Tahoe closed chair lifts because of flooding and operational problems, and posted a photo on Twitter showing one lift tower and its empty chairs surrounded by water. “We're seeing a lot of flooding,” Carpenter said. The Sacramento agency released a map of 24-hour precipitation through Saturday morning, showing a wide range of totals in the region, from less than an inch (2.54 centimetres) in some areas to more than five inches (12.7 centimetres) in the Sierra foothills. The Mammoth Mountain Ski Area reported numerous lift closings, citing high winds, low visibility and ice. The Stockton Police Department posted photos of a flooded railroad underpass and a car which appeared to have stalled in more than a foot (30 centimetres) of water. The rain was welcomed in drought-parched California, but much more precipitation is needed to make a significant difference. The past three years have been California’s driest on record. A winter storm warning was in effect into Sunday for the upper elevations of the Sierra from south of Yosemite National Park to north of Lake Tahoe, where as much as five feet (1.5 meters) of snow is possible atop the mountains, the National Weather Service said in Reno, Nevada. A flood watch was in effect across much of Northern California through New Year’s Eve. Officials warned that rivers and streams could overflow and urged residents to have sandbags ready. Some rainfall totals in the San Francisco Bay Area topped four inches (10 centimetres).

In El Dorado County, east of Sacramento, a stretch of Highway 50 was closed because of flooding. Humboldt County, where a 6.4 magnitude earthquake struck on December 20, also saw roadways begin to flood, according to the National Weather Service’s Eureka office. A bridge that was temporarily closed last week due to earthquake damage may be closed again if the Eel River, which it crosses, gets too high, officials said. It was the first of several storms expected to roll across California over the next week. The current system is expected to be warmer and wetter, while next week’s storms will be colder, said Hannah Chandler-Cooley, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Sacramento. The Sacramento region could receive a total of four to five inches (10 to 13 centimetres) of rain over the span of the week, Chandler-Cooley said. "Strong winds could cause tree damage and lead to power outages and high waves on Lake Tahoe may capsize small vessels," the weather service in Reno said. On the Sierra’s eastern front, flood watches and warnings were issued into the weekend north and south of Reno, Nevada, where minor to moderate flooding was forecast along some rivers and streams. In Southern California, moderate-to-heavy rain was falling Saturday. The region will begin drying out on New Year’s Day, with no rainfall expected during Monday's Rose Parade in Pasadena. Another round of heavy showers was forecast for Tuesday or Wednesday, the National Weather Service in Oxnard said.
