NFL star Damar Hamlin remains in a critical condition in hospital after suffering a cardiac arrest during the Buffalo Bills' game against the Cincinnati Bengals on Monday night. Hamlin's family released a statement on Tuesday thanking fans for their prayers. Hamlin received CPR on the field for six minutes, and reports claim paramedics used a defibrillator to restart his heart. The Bills safety, aged just 24, suffered the cardiac arrest after making a routine tackle on Bengals player Tee Higgins. After being treated on the field, Hamlin was loaded into an ambulance and taken to the University of Cincinnati Hospital, where he remains in a critical condition. Players from both teams were seen in tears on the field, and fans later waited outside the hospital hoping for good news. A fundraiser set up by Hamlin to buy toys for underprivileged children has now raised nearly $4million - after setting a target of just $2,500. And on Tuesday evening, Hamlin's family released a statement to thank fans for their generosity and medical professionals for their work in trying to save his life. The statement read: "On behalf of our family, we want to express our sincere gratitude for the love and support shown to Damar during this challenging time. We are deeply moved by the prayers, kind words and donations from fans around the country. "We also want to acknowledge the dedicated first responders and healthcare professionals at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center who have provided exceptional care to Damar. "We feel so blessed to be part of the Buffalo Bills organization and to have their support. We also want to thank Coach Taylor and the Bengals for everything they've done. "Your generosity and compassion mean the world to us. Please keep Damar in your prayers. We will release updates as soon as we have them."
