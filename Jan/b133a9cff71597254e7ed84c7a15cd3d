The clock is really beginning to tick down now with just five days remaining of the January transfer window. Premier League managers up and down the country will no doubt be desperate for their clubs to work some last-minute magic and bring in a quality reinforcement or two to boost their squads ahead of the second half of the season. Arsenal have been the name on everyone's lips due to their sensational campaign so far, and the Gunners have also been active in January, splashing out on signing winger Leandro Trossard from Brighton and defender Jakub Kiwior from Spezia. Mikel Arteta's desire for a central midfielder is well-known, though, and Real Sociedad star Martín Zubimendi is the latest name mentioned as a possibility. Could there be a breakthrough in a move for the 23-year-old today? Elsewhere, Manchester United are another of the elite sides hoping for at least one more signing. Rumour has it that Inter Milan right-back Denzel Dumfries' agent is currently in England and ready to hold talks with potential suitors over a deal. But will the Red Devils be able to hold off the competition and get their man? Meanwhile, Leeds are after Juventus' Weston McKennie, Tottenham are closing in on Sporting wing-back Pedro Porro and Chelsea are eyeing Brighton's Moises Caicedo.
