Nick Sands said Julian, 65, was not officially “presumed dead” after he vanished in his beloved LA hills nearly two weeks ago with wife Evgenia Citkowitz, 59. But he added: “I know in my heart that he has gone. However, sibling rivalry being what it is, it would be just like him to walk out of there and prove me wrong.” Nick revealed his Room With a View star brother was an experienced climber – scaling the Matterhorn and Eiger – after walking the Yorkshire Dales while growing up in Gargrave. Financial adviser Nick said: “When he recently walked the full length of the Pennine Way, he took just a small tent and averaged over 30 miles a day – not bad for a guy over 60.” In recent years Julian travelled the world in well-received one-man shows. The Arachnophobia actor, who moved to LA after movie success in the 80s and 90s, and Evgenia were last seen near his favourite place, the 10,000ft Mount Baldy. Despite being hampered by deadly storms, rescuers yesterday vowed to continue the search.
