The attack, on Saturday lunchtime, left several people injured, including the young girl who yesterday remained in a serious but stable condition in hospital. Detectives said the man was taken into custody after a car was stopped in Barnet, shortly before 4pm on Sunday.  The shooting, at around 1.30pm on Saturday, took place as mourners attended a service for a 20-year-old British-Colombian cancer victim andher 50-year-old mother. Family and friends of Sara Sanchez and her mother, Fresia Calderon, were at St Aloysius Church ­opposite Euston Railway station for the memorial. Mrs Calderon is understood to have died from a blood clot in November after a flight from Colombia to Heathrow, before Ms Sanchez died from terminal ­leukaemia three weeks later. It was when members of the congregation went outside to release white doves – a symbol of peace – that a man started firing a shotgun into the crowd from a car.  Police along with paramedics from London Ambulance Service and London Air Ambulance rushed to the scene amid reports of multiple injuries. Three women – aged 41, 48 and 54 – were taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, although the 48-year-old’s wounds were assessed as being potentially life-changing. A 21-year-old woman was also taken to a central London hospital, with her condition assessed as not life-threatening. Mrs Calderon had been married to a convicted member of the Cali drug cartel in Colombia.
