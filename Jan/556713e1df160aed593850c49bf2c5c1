A former US Navy SEAL father-of-four who went AWOL in 2019 has been killed in heavy fighting in Ukraine. American defence sources confirmed the death of Daniel W. Swift, who they said was not fighting in an official capacity, yesterday. Mr Swift's death comes as Russia begins an offensive in the Zaporizhzhia area in Ukraine shelling more than 160 times over the past day.    Swift, a 1st class petty officer, was injured in heavy fighting around Dnipro and reportedly died of his wounds. Dnipro has also been heavily shelled and bombed and Russian military leaders said today its troops had begun "offensive operations" in the region claiming to have "taken more advantageous lines and positions". It is not known where his body is or if it will be repatriated to the US. The US Navy, under which SEAL special forces teams operate, said Swift deserted his post in San Diego, California, in March 2019. A spokesperson said: “We cannot speculate as to why the former sailor was in Ukraine.” At least five other Americans are known to have died fighting in Ukraine, according to State Department statements and reports from individual families. Swift joined the Navy in 2005 and was assigned to a SEAL unit in 2007. He voluntarily left the service in January 2014, but rejoined in 2015, and was assigned to a SEAL unit a year later. After he deserted, Naval Special Warfare Command stripped him of his SEAL qualification — essentially revoking the trident SEALs wear. Swift also worked briefly — just over three months in 2015 — as a police officer in Medford, Oregon. Medford Police Department Deputy Chief Trevor Arnold had no further information Friday. He wrote a book in 2020 called “The Fall of a Man.” Its Amazon page says he became a father at age 20 and “by the time he was thirty he had deployed as a Navy SEAL five times to include Iraq, Afghanistan and Yemen." It adds that he had four children.

At least 6,000 people contacted the Ukrainian embassy in Washington during the opening weeks of the war seeking information about how to volunteer on behalf of Ukraine. Half the potential volunteers were quickly rejected for lacking military experience, having a criminal record, or otherwise not being fit to serve, Ukraine's military attaché said last year. An unknown number of Americans have joined units of foreign fighters supporting Kyiv, including former military members. Others are volunteering with aid groups and human-rights organizations. The Biden administration has made it clear that no current US service members are in combat in Ukraine, although there are some assigned to the embassy in Kyiv, including for security and with the defense attache's office. The State Department declined to address Swift's death specifically but said in a statement that it could confirm the recent death of a US citizen in Ukraine. The department said: “We are in touch with his family and providing all possible consular assistance.” DON'T MISS: US media says there is 'little evidence' of Palace 'army' trying to debunk Harry's claims
