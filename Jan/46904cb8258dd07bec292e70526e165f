Some 5.7 million Self-Assessment customers have only a couple of weeks to file their tax returns or face a financial penalty. Self-Assessment forms are filled in by those who are either self-employed or who own business to inform HMRC about their income and how much they need to pay in tax. The deadline for completing this tax return form is January 31, 2022 which means people who have yet to file do not have long left. Over 12 million customers are predicted to file a tax return for the 2021 to 2022 tax year by the deadline this month. According to HMRC, 129 customers submitted their returns on the first day of the New Year between 00:00am and 00:59am. More than 42,500 individuals decided to begin 2023 by submitting their tax return on 31 December 31 and January 1. Around 25,043 tax returns were filed on New Year’s Eve with the peak time for filing being between 14:00pm and 14:59pm.

Ahead of January 31, 2022, HMRC is warning the affected 5.3 million of the potential consequences they may face if they fail to complete their tax returns. Myrtle Lloyd, HMRC's director general for customer services, emphasised the importance of those who are self employed meeting this deadline later this month. She explained: “There is less than one month for customers to submit their tax returns and my message to those yet to start is: don’t delay, do it online. “HMRC provides lots of useful information to help you get started. Visit GOV.UK and search ‘Self Assessment’.” Customers are being warned by HMRC that the deadline to submit a paper return has already passed. As a result, tax returns can only be filed online and anyone who does so after January 31 could face a penalty. It should be noted that HMRC will treat people with genuine excuses for missing the deadline with leniency.

For anyone who is late in filing their tax returns, an initial £100 fixed penalty is awarded, even if there is no tax to pay, or if the tax due is paid on time. After a three-month period, there are additional daily penalties of £10 per day, up to a maximum amount of £900. At the six month mark, a further penalty of five percent of the tax due or £300 is added to the amount owed, whichever is greater at the time. When 12 months have passed, another five percent or £300 charge will be added once again, whichever is greater. Notably, there are extra penalties for paying late of five percent of the tax unpaid at 30 days, six months and 12 months.
