There's just over two weeks left of the January transfer window and clubs are still working apace to make signings before the 11pm January 31 deadline. Arsenal are scampering to find a forward after watching Chelsea swoop in and snap up Mykhaylo Mudryk. The Blues paid the Â£88million fee that the Gunners were reluctant to pay to Shakhtar Donetsk for the Ukrainian winger. Mudryk was unveiled to the Stamford Bridge crowd on Sunday and will become Chelsea's second most expensive signing ever if all his add-ons are paid to Shakhtar. Arsenal have now moved on to alternatives having also been denied Joao Felix by Chelsea earlier in the window. Among them are Barcelona duo Raphinha and Ferran Torres, though it is unclear if Mikel Arteta can snare either player. The Spaniard confirmed on Sunday after Arsenal defeated rivals Tottenham 2-0 in the north London derby that they remain keen to bring in fresh talent. Liverpool are another club who could be on the search for reinforcements late in the window. The Reds are desperately struggling for form and are shy of some energetic midfielders, though Jurgen Klopp has suggested any more additions - having already signed Cody Gakpo this month - are unlikely. While Manchester United brought in striker Wout Weghorst on loan but could yet be on the market to do more business before the deadline. Erik ten Hag's team were another side to have a good weekend as they defeated Premier League champions and nearby neighbours Man City in the derby at Old Trafford.
