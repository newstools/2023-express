 The average price of petrol rose to 148.77p a litre yesterday, having dropped to 148.35p a litre last Monday (January 23). Diesel averaged 170.36p a litre yesterday, having fallen to 170.29p a litre on Wednesday and Thursday of last week. Both of these prices are significantly lower than record prices set in July, when petrol peaked at 191.53p per litre and diesel at 199.07p. In comparison, one year ago, petrol averaged 146.53p a litre and diesel 149.91p a litre. Oil had dropped below $78 (£63.34) a barrel at the start of January but was valued last week at between $86 (£69.84) and $88 (71.46). The resulting increase fuelled rises in the wholesale cost of road fuel. Petrol had bottomed out at 49.2p a litre in December but stood at 62.7p at the end of last week.

Oil has fallen back in recent days, dragging wholesale prices with it, but not enough to prevent eventual pump price increases. So far, the price rises have been slow to take off, as highlighted by the AA’s fuel price spokesperson, Luke Bosdet. He added: “After a fall of close to 43p a litre since the summer record, drivers feared that a rebound in petrol prices would eventually happen.

But, putting today’s price in context, it is only 0.9p below the average price at the start of the Ukraine war (February 24 – 149.67p) when pump prices surged.” The HMRC also released official fuel consumption statistics today. They show that the UK petrol consumption remains at around 1.35 billion litres a month, having been just above 1.4 billion litres pre-pandemic. In 2019, the UK consumed 16.851 billion litres of petrol but last year got through 16.116 billion litres. Likewise, diesel consumption had been 30.035 billion litres in 2019 but last year stood at 29.144 billion litres.

Mr Bosdet continued, saying: “A 13p increase in wholesale petrol costs, if sustained, would propel the average petrol price to below the 167.0p a litre average on the day of the fuel duty cut – but only because of the 5p cut (6p with VAT). “Meanwhile, petrol and diesel as an essential expenditure in the cost of living crisis has been underlined by today’s figures from HMRC. “Demand remains down compared to pre-pandemic but not by much.” Fuel duty changes will be made towards the end of March when Chancellor Jeremy Hunt set to make a decision on whether to extend the 5p per litre cut. The Office for Budget Responsibility published its Economic and Fiscal Outlook report which included information about a potential 23 percent increase in fuel duty. It was said that the changes would be introduced with the Spring Statement, with it adding £5.7billion to Government coffers next year. This would be a record cash increase, and the first time any Government has raised fuel duty rates in cash terms since January 1, 2011. If the move was to go through then the current rate of fuel duty – cut from 57.95p per litre to 52.95p per litre in March 2022 – would rise to about 65p.
