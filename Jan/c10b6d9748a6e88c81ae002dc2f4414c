Talks of reconciliation between Prince Harry and the Royal Family are off the table, a royal source has revealed, as royals are still reeling from the fallout of the Duke's bombshell memoir. Since releasing his tell-all book, members of the Royal Household have been ignoring the Duke of Sussex, dodging questions about Harry and his wife Meghan Markle. The America-based couple reportedly fears an invitation to the King’s coronation may never come their way as a result. An unnamed royal insider confirmed the speculation to The Sun, saying: "There has been no conversations or contact." Royals, one by one, have come out for the first time since Harry’s book publication - all seemingly ignoring Harry. While on a visit to the Open Door Charity in Liverpool, Prince William and Kate kept their mouth shut when asked if the Prince of Wales had "had a chance to read your brother’s book at all". In a video shared by ITV royal producer Lizzie Robinson on Twitter, both the Prince and Princess of Wales walk by without commenting.  Instead, the royal couple moved forward with their royal engagement last Tuesday, thanking the incredible hospital workers and nurses for their hard work during the challenging winter months amid the NHS backlog crisis. A beaming King Charles was the first royal to emerge after Harry’s attacks on the Royal Household. The monarch, who attended a Sunday Service at St Lawrence's Church in Norfolk, smiled and waved as he spoke to wellwishers outside the church and did not mention Harry's memoir. Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, later come out in a Twitter post, in which she wished good luck to England Hockey team as the Men’s World Cup got underway last Friday in India. While she said she and her husband were behind the hockey team for their upcoming matches, she ignored Harry’s explosive memoir. She tweeted: "Good luck to David Ames, Paul Revington and the whole @EnglandHockey team as the Men’s World Cup gets underway”, adding: “My husband and I so enjoyed spending time with you at the Commonwealth Games and know you will do everyone proud in India. I’ll be cheering you on from home! - Sophie."

Buckingham Palace has so far refused to comment on the allegations, as pressure mounts on King Charles to strike back. Writing for the Daily Mail, Tom Bower said the King caught many guests off guard during a recent private dinner at Clarence House where he expressed his "obvious reluctance" to tackle his son’s disloyalty. Instead of confronting Harry, the monarch will "shy away from a bitter battle", King Charles told his guest, Mr Bower reported.

Mr Bower explained: "Such a suggestion must have truly shocked Britain’s monarchists, a constituency that makes up the vast majority of King Charles’ subjects." The growing rage around Harry’s memoir could put invitations to Charles’ coronation in peril, according to royal expert Robert Jobson. The Sunrise royal editor told Australian television: "I don't think politically it would be acceptable to the public, so I don't think he will be there." The ceremony, scheduled for May 6, will be cut down from two hours to one, with only 2,000 guests attending, in a scaled-back event amid the cost of living crisis.
