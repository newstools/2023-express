The Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s invite to King Charles III’s Coronation ceremony in May could be in doubt in light of the latest claims made by Harry in his bombshell memoir. In a comment piece for Sky News Australia, royal biographer Angela Levin has warned the Duke that he shouldn’t “hold breath” for an invite after his recent comments that he wants to reconcile with his family but only if the royals accept “accountability”. In her article, Ms Levin, who has met and interviewed Prince Harry, also claims that Harry’s betrayal has “backfired”. The royal expert added: “There are probably fewer people than he wanted feeling sorry for him”. The Coronation is set to take place in London on May 6, 2023, the same day that the couple’s young son Archie will be celebrating his fourth birthday. The coronation will be held at Westminster Abbey, which is the same place where Queen Elizabeth II held her coronation in 1953. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES…
