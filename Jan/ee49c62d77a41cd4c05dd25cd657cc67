Louise Redknapp, 48, took to social media earlier today to take her fans backstage while posing up a storm to show off her new season wardrobe update. The Eternal singer looked fabulous as she posed up a storm in a studio, while getting her hair and makeup retouched. In the clip, she could be seen giving the camera a fierce look while crossing one leg over the other to show off her thigh-high leather boots. Louise was dressed in a black velvet wrap dress, which was only partially visible underneath an oversized leather coat, paired with matching gloves. The Two Faced singer looked confident with her short blonde locks styled in loose waves and an air blow machine keeping them away from her face.
