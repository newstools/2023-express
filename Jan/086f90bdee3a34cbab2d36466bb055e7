Government complacency risks jeopardising the future of one of Britain's "economic powerhouses", it adds. The damning report from the Communications and Digital Committee urges ministers to commit to making the creative industries a key feature of its growth plan. The Lords also call for changes to education, citing employers' increasing demands for a "blend of creative and digital skills". The Daily Express launched our Strike A Chord Crusade after discovering that the number of children studying GCSE had plummeted by 19 percent in the past decade while A-Level figures are down 50 percent. It calls for music to be given the same status as core subjects maths, English and the sciences.  Pre-pandemic, the creative industries were worth over Â£110billion to the UK economy. Baroness Stowell, chair of the committee, described the UK's creative industries as "economic powerhouses". The report states: "The Government's approach is complacent and risks jeopardising the sector's commercial potential. Indeed, the creative industries scarcely featured in the 2022 Autumn Statement. This lack of focus risks affecting the UK's future prosperity, especially at a time of rising international competition in the sector and domestic economic challenges." A government spokesman said: "We are completely committed to supporting the creative industries."
