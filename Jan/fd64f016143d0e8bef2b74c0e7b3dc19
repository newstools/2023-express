Arsenal will attempt to strengthen their squad in the remaining two days of the transfer window despite having a second bid for Moises Caicedo rejected by Brighton. The Gunners have made a stunning fresh £70m proposal to their Premier League rivals, but saw it batted away on Sunday evening. Caicedo is Arsenal’s top midfield target and the 21-year-old has publicly urged Brighton to let him leave. It will now be up to the north Londoners whether they make a third bid or step away from their pursuit. If they choose the latter, another midfielder could be signed before Tuesday’s deadline. Mikel Arteta has made no secret of the fact that he wants to strengthen his squad. There is also interest in the Spain U19 right-back Ivan Fresneda. It remains to be seen how many players Arsenal bring in over the next few days. Keep up to date with all the Arsenal transfer news below…
