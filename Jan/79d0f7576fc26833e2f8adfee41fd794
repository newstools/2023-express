Chants of "you're only here for the parrots" rang around an east London football stadium on Saturday after the arrival of an unlikely set of pitch invaders - a flock of parakeets. Roughly 50 of the bright green tropical birds flew around Leyton Orient's Breyer Group Stadium for around 10 minutes as the EFL League Two leaders faced Doncaster. Orient fan Hannah Ramsey, from Hackney, said: "We see them at the ground every now and then but not usually this many or for so long. "One of them even in sat in the penalty area for a while. "Theo Archibald scored a worldie a few minutes before - I think they must have heard how good it was and flown over." The Os won the game 1-0 thanks to a dipping 25-yard volley by winger Archibald in the 68th minute.

It has often been supposed that parakeets were introduced to the UK by legendary guitarist Jimi Hendrix, or during the filming of a Humphrey Bogart film, but scientists claimed to debunk these theories in a 2019 study - after mapping half a century of sightings of the species rose-ringed parakeet (Psittacula krameri). After the flock's appearance on Saturday, Orient tweeted: "'You're only here for the parrots', rings out, as today's attendance is announced 7402, 384 travelling fans, and 50 parakeets."

"I'll take it as an omen: Orient are going up!" The victory means Orient, who have another winged creature, a wyvern, as their club crest, are five points clear at the top of the EFL League Two table, having played a game more than second-placed Stevenage.
