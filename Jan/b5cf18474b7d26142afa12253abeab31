ITV’s hit show The Masked Singer returned last Sunday with a new line-up of celebrities taking to the stage in elaborate and unusual costumes. Although many fans think they’ve already worked out who is hiding behind one of the hidden identities.  This Saturday, the remaining six contestants in the competition took to the stage following the first batch performing for the judges last weekend. Viewers got to see Jacket Potato, Rubbish, Piece of Cake, Fawn, Pigeon and Rhino all show off their vocal skills as fans were given a series of clues on who could be hiding behind the mask. Although it was one character in particular that left viewers convinced they’ve managed to work out who they are. Making their debut on the show, Rhino sang a rendition of the song Chasing Cars by Snow Patrol that left judges Davina McCall,  Jonathan Ross, Rita Ora and Mo Gilligan very impressed.
