A woman has admitted to killing her mother after being accused of stabbing her more than 30 times and filming the aftermath on her mobile phone. Hanaa Bennis, 21, has denied murdering her mother, Aziza Bennis, 58, a school dinner lady, at their Acton home on August 15, 2022. But she has admitted to manslaughter, with her lawyers arguing diminished responsibility from impaired mental function. Bennis attended her trial in the Old Bailey this afternoon, where the court heard she had a "volatile" relationship with her late mother. Prosecutor Joel Smith said police were called to the North London home she shared with her mother after neighbours heard "screams and sounds of a disturbance". He added that cries of "please don't hurt me!" emanated from the home. Ms Smith said that, at one point, Bennis was heard saying: "I'm sorry, I'm sorry." Officers arriving on the scene found the victim collapsed in her lounge. The court heard that investigators had recovered a blood-stained knife from the scene. The 58-year-old was pronounced dead on the scene despite efforts from emergency services. A post-mortem later concluded she had died from multiple stab injuries. Bennis was remanded in custody on July 31 last year, ahead of a two-week trial.
