King Charles III was not meant to be a parent, according to Prince Harry who claims his father "tried". Speaking to Tom Bradby for ITV ahead of the UK release of his UK autobiography 'Spare' on January 10, the Prince made a number of astonishing comments about his family. Harry acknowledged the "deep love" between him and his father, with Charles often referring to him as "my darling boy" when he was growing up. He said: "I love my father, I love my brother, I love my family, I always do." Referring to Charles in Spare, Harry writes: "He'd always given an air of being not quite ready for parenthood. "The responsibilities, the patience, the time.  "Even he, though a proud man, would have admitted as much. "But single parenthood - Pa was never made for that. To be fair, he tried." He also spoke of his father's admission that he should have stepped in earlier when it became clear his son had mental health problems.
