Thieves took just a little over a minute to snatch Anthony and Danielle Wilson’s £100,000 Range Rover from outside their gated home. A month later, it was found loaded on a container at a UK port bound for the Democratic Republic of Congo in central Africa.  The couple’s CCTV system recorded two thieves stealing their Range Rover Sport in a leafy Essex village. Anthony said: “When you watch the CCTV, it’s almost incredible that somebody walks up to the car, and 63 seconds later is driving an expensive car down the driveway having never seen the keys in their life.” The couple, who have a three-year-old child, believe they may have been followed by the thieves for some time before the car was taken. Danielle said: “Police said there was a chance that I’d been followed because they’d obviously got in it without the keys. So maybe they cloned the key or found a way to get into it when I’d been out and about.  “I only ever go anywhere with my little toddler, so it worried me then. I just found it really scary and the more I thought about it, the worse it got.” The car’s tracking system alerted police when it got out of range of the keys, which were still with the Wilsons in their home.
