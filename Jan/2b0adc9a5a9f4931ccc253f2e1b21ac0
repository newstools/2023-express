Arthritis is an umbrella term for several conditions where the joints become afflicted with debilitating pain. Most of these start with the deterioration of the cartilage. More painful forms of arthritis, like gout, occur when sharp "needle-shaped" crystals collect in the joints. According to some health bodies, two vitamins may contribute to the development of gout by leaving waste products in the blood. According to WebMD, gout “commonly occurs in episodic attacks that cause unexpected pain, typically through the night". It adds: “Gout attacks most commonly happen in the big toe, [...] other joints can experience severe pain and other symptoms." What's more, though the attacks typically occur at night they can last up to two weeks, and many people remain symptomless in between episodes. To prevent an attack from coming on, the University of Maryland Medical Centre cautions against the use of certain vitamins like niacin and vitamin A.

According to the Arthritis Foundation, gout develops predominantly in people "who have high levels of ruin acid in the blood".
