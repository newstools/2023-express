Six women have been arrested in connection with the death of a one-year-old boy at a nursery in Dudley in the West Midlands. The death is being treated as suspicious by the police.  Three women aged 20, 23 and 50 were arrested on December 16 on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter. They were then released on bail with strict conditions as enquiries continued. Another three women aged 51, 53 and 37 were arrested on Wednesday (January 4). Two were arrested on suspicion of corporate manslaughter and one on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter.   A criminal investigation was launched after an inspection by Ofsted following the boy’s death, according to West Midlands Police. The one-year-old died at the nursery on December 9. The nursery in Bourne Street, Dudley, and premises linked to it have since been closed by Ofsted, according to Birmingham Live. West Midlands Police has said the baby's family is being supported by specially trained officers. A post mortem examination has taken place, but more tests are to be carried out to establish the exact cause of death.  An Ofsted spokeswoman said: "We don’t comment on individual providers and it would be inappropriate for us to comment on the circumstances surrounding this child’s tragic death while a police investigation is underway." The watchdog suspended the nursery’s registration on December 14 because inspectors believed children may be at risk of harm. Inspectors visited the nursery the following day and issued a welfare requirements notice. This is a legal notice setting out a range of actions the nursery must take to make sure children are safe. Ofsted's spokeswoman said: "We are supporting the police with their ongoing investigation."
