Manchester United could announce the loan signing of Burnley striker Wout Weghorst today after he touched down in England yesterday. Weghorst has already completed part of his medical and will need to be registered before 12pm to feature in tomorrow's Manchester derby.

Harry Kane is also a new refusing to go away, with United fans told to 'keep an eye' on developments regarding the Tottenham Hotspur striker.
