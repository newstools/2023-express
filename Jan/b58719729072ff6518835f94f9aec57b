Residents in Trefusis Road, Flushing, near Falmouth were evacuated this morning after police were called to the village. Detective Inspector Claire Nicholls said residents were being "supported at Tregrew Farm as we await EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) assessment". A 100m cordon has been put in place and surrounding roads have been closed to ensure residents safety. Earlier this afternoon Flushing Ferry posted on social media:Â "Due to a possible unexploded device in Flushing the ferry service has been asked to stop by the authorities. We will resume as soon as we are allowed."  The EOD later deemed that the package was "no risk to the public". Devon and Cornwall Police confirmed that officers would be removing the cordons and roads would be reopened on Sunday evening.
