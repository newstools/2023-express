The Ministry of Defence's latest intelligence briefing on the war in Ukraine has noted moves in the Kremlin to extend the upper age of routine military conscription in Russia from 27 to 30. According to the report, Andrey Kartapolov, the head of the Russian State Duma Defence Committee believes the move could enable Putin to deliver his previously announced 30 percent increase in the size of Russia’s forces. The Ministry of Defence briefing on Sunday stated: "On 12 January 2023, Andrey Kartapolov, the head of the Russian State Duma Defence Committee, suggested Russia would extend the upper age of routine military conscription from 27 to 30 in time for the Spring 2023 draft. Kartapolov said the move would be intended to enable the previously announced 30 percent increase in the size of Russia’s forces. Last year, President Putin said he supported such a move, and Russian officials are likely sounding out public reactions. There is a realistic possibility that Russian leaders hope a change of age criteria for routine conscription could bolster personnel available to fight in Ukraine while appearing less alarming to the population than announcing another round of the unpopular ‘partial mobilisation’ process."
