A new meal plan introduced by Asda to help hard-pressed families has divided opinion. The supermarket giant says households can feed a family of four for just £20 a week with the new initiative called Just Essentials. Customers can use Asda's website to look at budget-friendly recipes and add each ingredient required, some as cheap as 16p, to their basket and then follow the method. But some shoppers argue families would benefit from home cooking and batch cooking. One man posted on Facebook: "More people should do home cooking. You'll find its cheaper and healthier." Another stated: "That is very expensive." However, the majority of Facebook users have praised Asda for the idea, introduced amid the cost-of-living crisis. One mum posted: "It is recipes using individual ingredients that are in the saver range." Another woman shared: "If this helps families who are struggling, it has to be a good idea." A third shopper wrote: "It’s all about healthy eating." Yorkshire Live reports the meal plan won the Quality Food Awards "Own Label Brand of the Year".  Examples of the options include tuna and tomato pasta and chicken stew and rice. The only things customers will need in their cupboards already to make the creations are oil, salt and pepper. Sam Dickson, acting chief customer office at Asda, said: "Our reputation for offering quality, low-cost food products means that we’re trusted by families and shoppers looking for good food on a budget. "Following the successful launch of our Just Essentials range, our seven meals for £20 plan goes one step further by offering recipe suggestions that can help customers create delicious, healthy meals for the whole family at a time when customers are looking for ways to make their shopping budgets work harder."
