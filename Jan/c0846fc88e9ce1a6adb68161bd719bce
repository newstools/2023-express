The January transfer window is nine days old and the majority of Premier League clubs are hard at work behind closed doors to put their plans for the mid-season market into action. Just under £300million was spent by teams in England's top flight last January and it seems as though a similar collective outlay could be splashed on new players over the coming weeks as managers up and down the country look to prepare their ranks for the all-important run-in. Manchester United are on the lookout for a new forward and have reportedly turned to Wout Weghorst, who is currently on loan at Besiktas from Burnley, in their bid to strengthen at the top of the pitch. The Red Devils are said to have earmarked the Dutchman as a potential signing in spite of his lacklustre Premier League strike rate of two goals from 20 appearances over the course of last season. Chelsea, meanwhile, have been tipped to go head-to-head with Tottenham for the signing of Brighton wide man Leandro Trossard on a free transfer at the end of the season. They could be joined in the hunt to land a new winger by Arsenal, who have been linked with a move for Mykhaylo Mudryk throughout the January window and will be desperate to improve their squad in order to maintain their surprise Premier League title charge.
