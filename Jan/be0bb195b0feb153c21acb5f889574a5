Lewis Hamilton may never replicate his past successes even if he stays in F1 for another five years, according to a new study. Hamilton failed to challenge Max Verstappen for the title last season as Mercedes struggled to match the pace of the frontrunners. The seven-time champion picked up his lowest-ever finish in the Drivers' Championship in 2022, P6. The Briton was also outscored by new team-mate George Russell after failing to close on the former Williams star’s early-season advantage. Hamilton was also unable to win a Grand Prix over the course of a season for the first time in his entire F1 career. In an exclusive poll for Express Sport, 43.3 per cent believe Hamilton will finish his career with between 103 and 110 race wins. The Mercedes star currently has 103 meaning he would more than likely need to surpass 110 to win another title.

In recent years, Hamilton won 11 races to secure the crown in 2018, 2019 and 2020. Meanwhile, Verstappen dominated the 2022 campaign with 15 race wins over the course of a season. Another 30.3 per cent of readers believe Hamilton will finish his career with between 111 and 120 race victories. Some 14.3 per cent feel he could win somewhere between 121 and 130 races with just 12.1 per cent backing the Mercedes driver to secure over 131 wins before his retirement. Hamilton is expected to sign a new multi-year deal at Mercedes over the winter in what could be his last deal in the sport.
