As we enter the New Year, many Britons may be looking for ways to make extra cash to sustain them and their families. With careful and intentional planning, people could be making £20,000 passive income to support their lifestyle in just eight years. By maxing out the account each year, for eight years, the total amount deposited would have been £160,000. The “key thing” she highlighted was the year-on-year growth from the account. She said: “This is where reinvesting and keeping the fund topped up and leaving it to grow is key because the size of your portfolio keeps growing so the amount you receive equally keeps growing. “As it builds up, at year eight, you can see growth worth £20,000 for that year and the total portfolio is around £238,000.

The compounding calculator showed that it would take 15 years to see a growth of £20,000 a year. She added: "Even in the worst-case scenario, we are getting therein effectively double the time."

Britons are reminded that with investing comes risk.
