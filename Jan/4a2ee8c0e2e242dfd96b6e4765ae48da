Roughly 400 Russian soldiers are reported to have died after Ukraine fired six long range missiles into occupied territory, officials have claimed. Ukraine's defence ministry said a large number of Russians had been killed “as a result of 'careless handling of heating devices’”, while 300 more were wounded. Scores of ammunition hidden in the school are believed to have blown up upon impact, causing the casualty toll to increase.
