Leading hosts including Ben Brown, Joanna Gosling, and Martine Croxall could be forced to reapply for their jobs in a rebrand with up to 14 presenters axed. From the spring, there will be no dedicated domestic news service, as the corporation merges its News and World News channels. Sources say because only five news channel presenter jobs will remain, current hosts must take a 40-minute “practical test”. It is believed they could be sacked if they fail to hold their own. Ben, 62, joined the BBC in 1988, Joanna, 51, has been a presenter for 23 years and Martine, 53, has hosted for more than 30 years. Last year she was temporarily taken off air after she was judged to have broken BBC impartiality rules with a “gleeful“ response to Boris Johnson scrapping his bid to return as Tory leader. However, high-profile presenters such as Huw Edwards, 61, Fiona Bruce, 58, and Clive Myrie, 58, are thought to havebeen spared from reapplying for jobs. The BBC expects to save more than £1million a year by cutting the number of presenters. But the broadcaster has said it hopes to find new roles for some of those affected. It declined to comment on the screen tests last night. The expected purge of newsreaders follows the recent departures of household names such as Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis, America correspondent Jon Sopel and Sunday morning presenter Andrew Marr. Emily, 52, and Jon, 63, left to present a daily podcast for Global Player. Andrew, 63, went to present radio shows for LBC and Classic FM last year. Their exits, along with several others in the previous year, are thought to have saved the corporation £2million. Former Radio 4 Feedback host Roger Bolton, 77, said licence fee-payers had been given no say over the cuts and reforms. He said: “With inflation rampant, further cuts are in the offing. All this is happening without the people who pay for the corporation being consulted. “The oft-used slogan ‘It’s your BBC’ is in danger of ringing hollow.”
