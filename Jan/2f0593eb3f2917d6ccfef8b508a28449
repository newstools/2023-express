A man has been charged with sexual offences against seven different women at a popular seaside resort. Hanok Zeray, 31, of Ringmer Road, Brighton, has been charged with rape after a woman reported being attacked in Brighton City Centre. He has also been charged in relation to five counts of sexual assault by touching and one of sexual assault by penetration in relation to six separate reports in 2022. Sussex Police said the reports came from lone women in public spaces in the city, with three incidents on May 22, one on June 19 and two further incidents on October 23. Following the charge, Detective Sergeant Melissa Trevelyan said women should have been able to feel safe in public spaces. She said: “Women have a right to go about their business without having to fear being raped or sexually assaulted. “These reports came from women who were simply out in public spaces – places where they should have felt safe. “We are pleased to have a suspect in custody and I would like to thank all of these women for reporting the incidents to the police so we could take positive action.” Confirming the charges, a Sussex Police spokesman said: "Officers have charged a man with rape and six counts of sexual assault against seven different women in Brighton.
