JUST IN: Meghan could release her own memoir in months as publisher scrambles after Spare's success In his book, the Duke ranged from addressing Prince William as his "beloved brother" to branding him his "arch-nemesis". He wrote: "In some ways, he was my mirror, in some ways he was my opposite. My beloved brother, my arch nemesis, how had that happened?" Addressing his choice of words in an interview with GMA, the Duke explained: "There has always been this competition between us, weirdly. "Again I think it really plays into or is played by the 'heir/spare' and the British press's part in that. Right. "They pitched the Waleses right, of which Kate and William are now, against the Sussexes, me and my wife. They always pitched us against each other. They pitched Kate and Meghan against each other."

Prince Harry wrote: "I was summoned to provide backup, distraction, diversion and, if necessary, a spare part. Kidney, perhaps. Blood transfusion. Speck of bone marrow.

At a public outing in Liverpool with the Princess of Wales, William was asked whether he was "hurt by the comments in Harry's book sir" but refused to answer the question. But despite the ongoing frostiness between the brothers, some insiders suggest the pair could ultimately be reunited before the King's coronation in May. A source close to both sides told the Daily Mail that the ongoing feud is "fixable" but will need Harry to be in the UK so he can be in the same room as his brother and father. They added: "Both sides need to hold their hands up and admit, 'we didn't get everything right, and we got a lot wrong'... It's going to take flexibility on all sides, but it can be done. "It needs Harry over here, in the room with the King and Prince of Wales, a couple of other family members, some of 'his people' he trusts who always had his back, so he doesn't think he's being ambushed."
