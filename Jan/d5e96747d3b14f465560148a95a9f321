As temperatures drop below zero across the UK, an increasing number of people will be struggling with condensation in their homes.  writes the Manchester Evening News, with one person saying it eradicated black mould and condensation from their home in two days. As one five-star reviewer wrote: "Doesn't need need power, one ring is enough for 1.5 time its about 1litre of water." Another said: "Product works very well. Lots of moisture removed from room." A third impressed shopper recalled: "Bought this to help with condensation in our bathroom which was causing black mould to appear.Wasn't sure if theses things actually worked but was willing to have a try. Within 2 days of use there was 1cm depth of water in collection tank! The solid disc you pop in the top slowly dissolves and the water collects in the tank. "Condensation gone, black mould gone. Have put one in my loft (now with more insulation) as I noticed water on the top of Xmas decoration box. That's working up there too. Well worth the money." A fourth person said: "Excellent at absorbing moisture, even from my metal patio doors."    While somebody else wrote: "I found this after the other well known brand sold out overnight. I noticed the reviews were much better on this one anyway so decided to give it a go and so glad I did. "We have one in the front room and one in a bedroom and the amount of liquid it has collected is crazy."
