Eliza and Amelia attended the New Nobu Opening during the Atlantis, The Royal Grand Reveal Weekend, a new ultra-luxury resort in Dubai on Friday, January 20. The sisters were joined by their partners, Greg Mallett and Michael Lewis. For the event and the afterparty, Eliza and Amelia opted for short mini dresses: Amelia wore a white dress, while Eliza donned a black dress. Amelia's dress was long-sleeved and featured a round neckline and a feather-like skirt. It also had cut-out square on its bodice. The dress was brand-new and by Zimmermann, from the Australian designer's Spring/Summer 2023 Ready-To-Wear collection. Amelia matched this with the N.18 Crystal Embellished Clutch Bag by Fregoli Italia.

Amelia completed the outfit with a pair of heels from Gina Shoes. These were the 'Dietrich' Camel Satin Platform Sandals with Swarovski crystals. The crystals covered the whole shoe, as well as the platform heel. Royal fans were quick to comment on Amelia's outfit, which divided opinions - some liked it, while others were unimpressed by it.
