It's looking increasingly likely that the Golden State Warriors dynasty team look like they're about to be breaking up this summer, with a number of key individuals set to see out their contracts - with three individuals playing huge roles over the last 10 years - in moves that could see Steph Curry concerned with the future of the franchise and risk upsetting him as he enters a different stage in his career. After signing Jordan Poole to a max contract extension, it now looks like it is going to be difficult to keep both Klay Thompson and Draymond Green. Two players who have been with the team since 2012, Thompson and Green have been ever-presents with Curry, but both are set to become free agents this summer. Thompson had looked like his better days were behind him earlier this season, after coming back from two years away from the sport after two surgeries from injuries. But in recent weeks, Thompson has performed at a high level once more, remaining the perfect shooting guard alongside Curry. For Green though, his pre-season controvery may see him leave the team, after he punched Poole in a training session. Green is likely to command a max contract, something the Warriors will struggle to pay to him - in a move that would certainly hurt the team defensively.  But there's a notable off-the-floor move that could upset Curry most of all, with general manager Bob Myers set to become a free agent with no extension yet agreed. The Athletic have reported that Myers' exit would be 'unsettling' to Curry, and that teams are already showing interest in acquiring him. Myers has spearheaded the dynasty, and made the decision to controversially fire former coach Mark Jackson before hiring Steve Kerr. For Curry, the point guard will turn 35 in just a few weeks and will not want to be a part of a rebuild of Myers does leave the team. Curry has played for the Warriors throughout his entire NBA career, and may look to play elsewhere should an opportunity come for him to do so.
