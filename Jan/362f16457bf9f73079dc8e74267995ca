A Premier League football arrested in connection with a rape charge has had his bail extended for a third time, the Mirror reports. The man, who denies the charges was arrested last summer following a complaint made by a woman in her 20s. The player continued to play for his club with the Premier League side saying that he would not be suspended while the police investigation remains ongoing.  The force previously said: “On 4 July, an allegation of rape of a woman in her 20s was reported to police. It was reported the alleged rape happened in June 2022. “While in custody, he was further arrested on suspicion of two incidents of rape that were alleged to have been committed in April and June of 2021 against a different woman in her 20s. “No further action will be taken in relation to the alleged offence in June 2021 because the relevant legislation had not yet come into effect at the time it is said to have occurred.”  In a statement his club said they would be keeping the matter "under close consideration". It said: “We are aware of the allegations which are currently the subject of a police investigation. “We have confirmed that the player denies the allegations and is on police bail pending the outcome of their enquiries. There have been no charges laid and the player can fulfil his professional commitments including permitted travel. “We take our commitments and responsibilities seriously and have followed our safeguarding policies and procedures. We will keep this matter under close consideration and will review further if circumstances change."
