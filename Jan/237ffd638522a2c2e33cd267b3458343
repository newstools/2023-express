Nile Gardiner has slammed Prince Harry as "paranoid" and "unhinged" following his interview with Anderson Cooper on CBS. The Prince described the British press as "bigoted" in their treatment of Meghan Markle, even addressing his own prejudice before he met his wife. Writing on Twitter Mr Gardiner said: "Harry comes across as completely paranoid, and even unhinged. "His view of Britain, its free press and the British people is exceedingly dark and unpleasant." Shortly after his relationship with Meghan became public, the Duke of Sussex put out a statement condemning the tabloids and the "racial undertones" in their stories about the Duchess, something unprecedented in royal circles. In the interview Mr Cooper asks Harry why then-Prince Charles and Prince William were "furious" at him for publishing those words.  He responded: "They felt as though it made them look bad. "They felt as though they didn't have a chance or weren't able to do that for their partners. "What Meghan had to go through was similar in some part to what Kate and what Camilla went through, very different circumstances.
