Carol’s fiery take on her former pal came when Alison Hammond and Dermot O’Leary asked her and Gyles Brandreth for their thoughts on Rod Stewart’s recent outburst about the NHS on Sky News. Carol pulled no punches when she sympathised with the singer before putting Michelle in the firing line. After Gyles suggested Rod was “angry” because of the reports of “£15billion wastage” on PPE, Carol weighed in. "I cannot talk about useless PPE without also talking about Michelle Mone who was brought into the House of Lords, as a baroness, by David Cameron,” she ranted. Carol then added Michelle, founder of lingerie firm Ultimo, was accused of profiting from PPE contracts, a claim which Michelle has denied. A statement released by Michelle's office at the time of the claims said: "With immediate effect, Baroness Mone will be taking a leave of absence from the House of Lords in order to clear her name of the allegations that have been unjustly levelled against her."
