They are predicting the busiest weekend since the start of the pandemic, with Sunday tipped to be the big day for 2023 bookings. Experts said the lack of Covid restrictions, and a need to escape strikes and crisis has fuelled the boom. Despite ongoing pressures on finances, Mark Tanzer, CEO of travel industry trade body Abta, said "people's appetite for holiday taking has remained remarkably resilient". A spokesperson for Thomas Cook Holidays said: "Bookings are higher than they've been for the past two years. As payday arrives more customers will book the holidays they've been researching, making the last week of January another record-breaker." Zoe Harris, chief customer officer at On the Beach, said: "We're expecting bumper bookings this weekend. Sunday will be the big day, but we're also seeing a shift post-Covid on people booking on a Friday. "Friday is now a work-from-home day for most and it seems many are taking advantage of this." According to its research, despite the cost-of-living squeeze, customers are not prepared to give up their holidays. Turkey is proving popular, as well as the Greek islands and Dubai. Ms Harris added: "We're actually seeing a rise in the number of people booking all-inclusive as customers start to get savvy with their money." Average spending per holiday was Â£3,104 in the second week of January, up about five percent on last year, according to the Advantage Travel Partnership. Lastminute.com expects to see a boost of 15-30 percent in comparison with the average volumes in January. It said Spain remained the most popular destination, with Tenerife and Majorca as star performers, followed by Malta and the Algarve.
