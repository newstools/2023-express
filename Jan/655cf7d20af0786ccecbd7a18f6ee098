Manchester United are reportedly accelerating their attempts to back Erik ten Hag with a new striker in the January transfer window. The Red Devils are eyeing a cut-price option as the Glazers' sale of the club grows closer while their Premier League top-four rivals splash the cash on reinforcements. That said, reports emerging from France claim United are ready to offer £53million to sign Eintracht Frankfurt striker Randal Kolo Muani. Ten Hag wants to use some of his summer budget early to bring the Frenchman to Old Trafford but faces a significant hurdle. Another player on United's agenda is Borussia Monchengladbach's Marcus Thuram, who is said to include the Premier League giants among his 'dream' destinations. Reports in Germany suggest an approach has been made, with the Bundesliga outfit willing to sell for as low as £8.8m. Sunderland loanee Amad is a third option amid his impressive antics in the Championship, with United backed to recall him to add depth to Ten Hag's attack. However, the Dutchman has made his stance on the 20-year-old winger clear. Follow Man Utd transfer news LIVE updates below...
