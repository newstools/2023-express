Volodymyr Zelensky is under no obligation to issue an invitation to a former premier but has made it clear he considers Mr Johnson a friend and true ally. Crucially, the Ukrainian leader knows the former prime minister is a man who can get things done.  It is no coincidence that as he battles to secure the tanks he needs from allies, the president has turned to the ex-PM who rallied European nations at the start of the invasion. Mr Johnson was clearly surprised that Mr Zelensky had gathered together some of the senior figures from his previous visits to meet him now that he travels as a humble backbench MP rather than the nation’s leader. But the decision shows that his contribution remains greatly valued in Ukraine. That was also reflected on the streets of Ukraine where ordinary people in a war-torn nation greeted him with delight. Some Tories fear that Mr Johnson’s visit undermines Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. Downing Street insisted that is not the case. Everyone involved must remember it is Russian president Vladimir Putin who is the enemy and should not be distracted by any party squabbling.
