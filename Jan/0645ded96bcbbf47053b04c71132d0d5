New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft has been warned he'll soon have to make a "hard call" over the future of the franchise and whether head coach Bill Belichick will remain in his job. Belichick confirmed on Tuesday that he would be staying on as head coach. Belichick's comments came hours after the Patriots missed out on the play-offs for the second time in three years. The organisation has been on the slide since Tom Brady's 2020 departure. The offensive unit seemed to be lacklustre at best, with the defence often carrying the team to wins. Mac Jones struggled at quarterback, with Bailey Zappe earning calls to replace him. The Patriots lost against the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday night to officially end their season, but despite the disappointment Belichick insisted he'd return for next season. There had been doubts over the 71-year-old's future in the sport. Belichick will now enter into his 24th season as head coach of the Patriots, and he seems to be showing no signs of slowing down. As a result, Kraft has been warned he might have to intervene before too long. Speaking on Fox Sports' Undisputed about whether Belichick will choose when to walk away, NFL expert Skip Bayless said: "He can't do that. Robert Kraft will not allow that. He's the keeper of the kingdom and at some point he's going to have to make a very hard call here." This year, the coaching staff was wildly different with Belichick in particular blamed for that. And Bayless explained he believes the head coach was simply trying to do too much. "I said from the start it was 75 percent Brady and 25 percent Belichick, and I believe slowly but surely Belichick has been exposed. He can't build a football team. This team has been badly coached, to me," he said. On the coaching staff changes, Bayless quipped: "[On the coaching hires] What was that about? I'm convinced he wanted his hands in the offence to polish his genius of being able to do both sides of the ball."
