Lucy said: "We always said 2019 was our best year, but we were so convinced 2023 was going to be the year to top it. "You are supposed to be finally living the life you have dreamed of, you had so many plans, hopes and dreams, we had so many plans and it breaks my heart that it has all been taken away. I love you so so much."  She added: "I should not be waking up this morning on New Year's Day without you, we should be dancing and singing this morning whilst we got ready to go out." Sharing images of the pair together, she added: "I miss you so much sis. You are and will always be my best friend, sidekick, partner in crime, soul mate and big sister. "You are beautiful inside and out, you are the kindest person ever and you wanted nothing but the best for me. I miss everything about you, especially our daily catch-ups, our long drives." As she paid tribute, beautician Elle's white Mercedes remained outside the Lighthouse Inn in Wallasey Village, Merseyside, scene of the tragedy.  Innocent bystander Elle, 26, was shot when a gunman opened fire with a suspected automatic pistol. On Saturday, up to 20 members of her family attended prayers. Her distraught mother was seen wiping away tears as she walked into the Holy Apostles and Martyrs where candles were lit for Elle. A third person arrested was freed on bail on Saturday. The 31-year-old man has now been released pending further inquiries. A 30-year-old man has been recalled to prison. And a 19-year-old woman has been released on bail.
