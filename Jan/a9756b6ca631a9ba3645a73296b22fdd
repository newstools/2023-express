A new mum has thanked her baby for saving her – after doctors removed a fast-growing brain tumour before it was too late. Abi Naylor, 28, started suffering excruciating migraines a week after the arrival of son Roman. She said: “After a few days I could barely see or walk.” So she was rushed to hospital where a scan showed she had a near three inch tumour and needed emergency surgery. The shocked couple were told the tumour’s growth had accelerated due to her pregnancy hormones and was close to causing permanent nerve damage. If it was left any longer it may have become inoperable and caused life-changing problems with her fine motor skill and facial muscles. Doctors removed the whole tumour in four hours of surgery and it was found to be benign, so Abi does not need further treatment. The couple were overjoyed to welcome their son after suffering a miscarriage in 2021 and delivering their first baby stillborn. Abi, a workplace mentor, from Congleton, Cheshire, said: “We have no idea how long the tumour was there and growing for. “Doctors think the hormones and stress of labour ended up accelerating the growth of the tumour. If it weren’t for being pregnant, it may have grown for longer and caused more damage. My little boy saved my life.” Her husband Ross said: “I dread to think what would have happened if Roman hadn’t come along. He’s a little hero.”
