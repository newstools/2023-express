Parents are set to hit reality tomorrow after the Christmas break with a strong reminder that dangerous and potentially deadly winter bugs are still "circulating at high levels." That's in a message from the UK Health Security Agency which expects cases of Strep A, Scarlet fever, flu and Covid to carry on surging throughout January. The advice, put simply, is to keep children with a fever at home and away from school and nursery in a bid to stifle the spread of such bugs. Adults should also stay indoors if they feel poorly, and wear a mask if they have to go out. They should also avoid visiting vulnerable relatives and friends until they are feeling better - with the only exception being in an emergency.            It comes as cases of Strep A have become rampant this season, with the Government recording 33,836 from September 19 to Christmas Day. This is a staggering increase from 4.672 in the last "comparably high season" - winter 2017 and into 2018. In 2017 to 2018 there were 30,768 scarlet fever notifications overall across the year, the data shows. Scarlet fever is caused by bacteria named group A streptococci - a bacteria which can cause skin infections like strep throat and impetigo. In rare instances, the bacteria can get into the bloodstream and cause invasive group A strep, which has claimed the lives 25 children under 18 in England over the last four months. Professor Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said: "It’s important to minimise the spread of infection in schools and other education and childcare settings as much as possible. If your child is unwell and has a fever, they should stay home from school or nursery until they feel better and the fever has resolved.   "Helping children to learn about the importance of good hand hygiene is also key, so practice regular handwashing at home with soap and warm water. Catching coughs and sneezes in tissues then binning them is another simple way to help stop illness from spreading. "Adults should also try to stay home when unwell and if you do have to go out, wear a face covering. When unwell don’t visit healthcare settings or visit vulnerable people unless urgent. "Remember that flu vaccination is still available for all eligible groups and is the best protection against the virus. We have seen good uptake in older age groups but vaccination among young children remains low. "Flu can be very unpleasant and in some cases can lead to more serious illness. Getting your child vaccinated protects them and others they come into contact with, and it’s still not too late."

But there is an eligibility criteria. Toddlers need to be aged two and three on August 31, 2022. All primary school aged children can have it, and some secondary school pupils. Early symptoms of Strep A are very similar to those of flu. The child could be suffering from a high temperature, aching body and swollen glands. They could also breakout in a rash which looks and feels like sandpaper. "Most strep A infections are not serious and can be treated with antibiotics," the NHS says. People have been told to consult the help of 111 if a child is ill and getting worse, struggling to feed and refusing drink. This is also the case if a baby or toddler has fewer wet nappies than usual, or is peeing less. But, if a child suddenly goes floppy, unresponsive and or is struggling to breathe, 999 must be dialled.   Last month Dr Obaghe Edeghere, UKHSA incident director, said: "We are continuing to see a rise in scarlet fever and ‘strep throat’ and this is understandably concerning for parents. However I would stress that the condition can be easily treated with antibiotics and it is very rare that a child will go on to become more seriously ill. "Over the winter, there are lots of illnesses circulating that can make children unwell and so it is important to avoid contact with other people if you are feeling unwell, wash your hands regularly and thoroughly and catch coughs and sneezes in a tissue. I would also urge all those eligible for free winter vaccines to take advantage of these. "Most winter illnesses can be managed at home and NHS.UK has information to help parents look after children with mild illness. However please do make sure you speak to a healthcare professional if you believe your child is getting worse for instance they are feeding or eating less than normal, are dehydrated, has a high temperature that won’t go down, is very hot and sweaty or seems more tired or irritable than normal."
