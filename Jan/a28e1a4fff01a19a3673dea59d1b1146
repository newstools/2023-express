It’s definitely worth Bond holders checking if they have won anything, as the prize fund rate has increased from 2.2 percent to three percent. Customers can find out if they have won any prizes by using the prize checker tool on the NS&I website. The tool works by a person putting in their holder’s number. It will then tell them if they have any uncollected prizes, from the latest prize draw or from previous draws. A person’s holder’s number can be found on their Bond record or by logging into their account. The number will have either nine or 10 digits, or it will have eight digits and be followed by a letter.
