Kevin Durant and the Brooklyn Nets are on fire at the moment having won 11 games straight, and it's clear to see the superstar NBA forward is in a better mood than he started the season in. During Saturday night's game against the New Years Eve game against the Charlotte Hornets, Durant was caught on camera enjoying a moment with a young fan. The Nets supporter in question was filmed holding up a giant sign reading: "KD is my GOAT pick sorry MJ I'm only 12". The camera immediately panned back to Durant, who was sat on the bench at the time and appeared to take notice of the sign. In the clip, Durant can be seen looking over at the sign before grinning and clearly containing laughter. The young fan, clearly noticing Durant's reaction, turned back to her family and was crying with joy. Durant went on to score 23 points in the win along with five rebounds and four assists. The Nets were dominant throughout, with Kyrie Irving scoring 28 points and both Nic Claxton and Royce O'Neale putting up 14 each. The Nets have turned the corner after a poor start to the season, which saw head coach Steve Nash fired and Irving suspended. Speaking afterwards, Durant explained how he felt the team was better off for having gone through the hardship 2022 brought them. "It was one of those years you reflect on and you see the turning points in the organization," he said. "We've seen different moments that brought us together as a group. "You see, at this point now towards the end of the year, you start to see us come together and perform what we've been looking to do these last couple of years, which was a solid team that plays hard every night. "So we went through a lot in this calendar year, but we're looking for bigger and better things in 2023."
