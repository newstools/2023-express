 JLo flaunted her toned physique in a black lace bra with statement gold details and white satin pyjama shorts. The mother-of-two dripped in glamour with a matching white satin shirt which was left entirely unbuttoned as she posed by a piano. Jennifer is one of the newest ambassadors for the lingerie brand Intimissimi and the company kicked off the New Year by releasing the photos on their Instagram page. The On The Floor singer has previously modelled some pyjamas for the brand but this is the first time she has shown off her enviable figure in Intimissimi lingerie. On New Yearsâ€™ Eve, the singer showed off her flawless figure on her own Instagram page as she celebrated the night in a tight-fitting red and black gown.
