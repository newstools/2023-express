Tyson Fury accidentally called out Barcelona and England right-back Lucy Bronze over Twitter back in 2014. The Gypsy King mistakenly tagged the Lioness star in an explicit post which was supposed to be directed at the Bronze Bomber, Deontay Wilder. At the time, Fury was set to rematch Derek Chisora having beaten him on points three years earlier. However, after Chisora was forced to pull out days before the contest with a fractured hand, Fury called for Wilder to step in and face him instead. Unfortunately, though, the tweet never made it to the American with Fury tagging Bronze instead. “Told you all what would happen find me a real man to fight the furious1. P****s, p****s, p****s. @LucyBronze I want u punk?” he wrote. Before the Mancunian admitted to his mistake. “Ok I pressed the wrong person @LucyBronze,” he added. But Bronze took it well, poking fun at the situation. “Hahaha the tweets I’m getting because of this," Bronze replied. “Sorry to let everyone down, but I’m unavailable for a fight.” Fury would eventually get his wish of fighting Wilder four years later at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. The Gypsy King picked himself up off the canvas in the twelfth and final round of an enthralling contest to finish strong down the home straight. MORE BOXING NEWS...

Fury has since gone on to defeat long-time WBC mandatory Dillian Whyte and the aforementioned Chisora in a third fight. He is now expected to square off against Oleksandr Usyk in the first undisputed heavyweight unification clash of the four-belt era. According to Usyk’s promoter, Alexander Krassyuk, the fight is being targeted for a date between February 18 and March 4 in either the Middle East or the UK. “We have a basic option to make it happen at Wembley or Cardiff or any other place in the UK,” Krassyuk told SecondsOut. “But as long as we are working for our man, who is the best heavyweight in the world, we have to bring him the biggest benefit. So, we are now working on that, working on a site. We are in negotiations with three countries in the Middle East and we still have the basic option of Great Britain. “So, the worst scenario, it goes to Wembley or any other big stadium (in the UK). Any other scenario is that it takes place in the Middle East. The deadline (for the fight to take place) we agree, together, is the 4th of March. In case it doesn’t happen [on] the fourth of March, it’s not likely to happen ever.”
