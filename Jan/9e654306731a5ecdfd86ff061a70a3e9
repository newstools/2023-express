Water companies up and down the country have announced they are increasing financial support for customers by more than £200 million. Thousands more Britons will be able to make savings on their water bills and are being urged to contact their water companies to see if they are eligible for this new funding.    Campaigners are encouraging anyone struggling to pay rising bills and soaring food prices during the cost of living not to overlook their water bills as savings can be made. While some of this expanded support is available right now, other schemes are starting over the next few weeks and months. Targeted support is also available for low-income customers who use a lot of water for essential family or health reasons through the WaterSure scheme as well as for people with sight, hearing, or mobility difficulties. Knowledge of saving money on water is low but a new campaign called ‘Support on Tap’ aims to make people aware of all the help available from water companies.

That’s why they are taking decisive action to ensure those in need get the right help. “I would urge anyone who is worried about paying their bill to get in touch with their water company today. There is a range of help available, and companies are increasingly working with other organisations to ensure everyone is aware of the help available.” Phoning one's water company coud result in them adjusting the direct debit if they feel this wouldn't get people into debt. People can also ask to be put on a water meter although they should proceed with caution as it could end up costing more - MoneySavingExpert founder Martin Lewis says those with more rooms in teh property than people may save.
