Prosecutors said Helen Hewlett, 43, went on the dark web to find someone to murder Paul Belton. Barrister Marti Blair KC said it happened after Hewlett had stalked him for more than two and a half years and made false accusations of sexual harassment.  She used all her savings, overdraft and loans to buy Bitcoin to place an order on a site called Online Killers Market, Norwich Crown Court was told. Ms Blair said the factory worker put £20,547 in an online account, with Mr Belton’s name, home, work addresses and pictures, and told would-be hitmen: “It’s vital it looks like an accident.” She said Hewlett also searched online for local fatal accidents to see if the killing had been carried out. The court heard Hewlett, who was arrested after a tip-off to police, told officers she had “no intention of going through with the order” to kill Mr Belton. But Ms Blair said: “These actions go far beyond mere fantasy.” The jury was told Hewlett, of King’s Lynn, Norfolk, and Mr Belton, both of whom were married with children, met at the Linda McCartney frozen food factory in Fakenham, in the county.   Ms Blair said her pursuit of Mr Belton, a staff trainer, was “relentless” after flirting led to “intimate touching and kissing” in a car. Mr Belton “immediately regretted” the encounter and even left to work in another factory. But Hewlett also got a job there in a bid to continue the relationship, Ms Blair said. Mr Belton said Hewlett bombarded him with emails and texts and had sent him nude pictures of herself and a video of her performing a sex act. Hewlett denies stalking Mr Belton, causing him potential serious alarm or distress, from 2020 to 2021 and soliciting murder from August 1 to August 13 last year. The trial continues.
