Joan Collins, 89, looked decades younger in a new picture uploaded to social media to mark her reunion with Dita Von Teese, 50. The actress was all smiles as she posed next to her friend in a snap shared in view of her 302,000 Instagram followers. Joan looked fabulous with her hair styled in voluminous waves as she wore a ruffled black dress that was adorned with a show-stopping flower brooch. Dita stunned in a dazzling silver sequinned dress that she teamed with drop earrings and a bold red lip. In the caption, Joan cheekily admitted she had asked Dita to sign a stocking for her son-in-law, asking fans if the unusual present made her a “wicked mother-in-law”.
