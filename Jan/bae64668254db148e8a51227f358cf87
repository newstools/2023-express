A passenger coach in Pakistan carrying dozens of people plunged into a ravine this morning, sparking a frantic emergency response. Footage on social media saw the overturned bus engulfed in flames during the early hours of this morning. Emergency ambulance crews and police were quickly on the scene with at least 40 people reported to have died. Another four have been rushed to a hospital for their injuries. Among those rescued alive so far include a woman and a child. However, the number of passengers on board at the time is thought to be at least 48, as officials warn the death toll is likely to rise. Those at the scene said that the rescue work was still underway and would be completed this afternoon.

The accident took place in the Lasbela district of Pakistan's southwestern Balochistan province - a place renowned for so-called 'killer highways'. Bela Assistant Commissioner Hamza Anjum Nadeem said that the rescue operation faced obstacles due to the freezing conditions in the area. He confirmed they had completely extinguished the flames engulfing the vehicle after it took nearly two hours to control.  Police have blamed the tragedy on speeding. Mr Nadeem added that DNA testing will have to be carried out to identify many of the deceased. Balochistan's dangerous single-lane roads are known to claim thousands of lives annually.
