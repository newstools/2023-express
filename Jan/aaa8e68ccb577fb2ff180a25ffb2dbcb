The country is suffering another day of bone-chilling temperaturesÂ with maps showing the nation struggling to get anywhere above freezing today. The Met Office has had most of the nation under yellow weather warnings this week, with parts of Scotland under an amber alert. Yellow warnings remain in place today with people not expected to see - or feel - any warmth on the horizon until at least this weekend. Met Office chief meteorologist, Paul Gundersen, said: "Cold air is continuing to push across the UK from the north and many areas have seen some snow, wintry conditions, and overnight frosts. "National Severe Weather Warnings have been issued across parts of western England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland with more warnings likely to be issued over the coming days."
