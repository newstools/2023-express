Liz Hurley, 57, looked sensational on Wednesday night as she arrived at the Royal Albert Hall to watch the European premiere of Cirque du Soleil's Kurios: Cabinet Of Curiosities. The actress looked chic in a plunging black blazer paired with matching trousers and sky-high heels. The blazer's plunging neckline and tailored silhouette showed off Liz's fabulous figure. She also added a hint of sparkle with some silver drop earrings to match detailing on her jacket. The brunette beauty attended the event with her lookalike son, Damian, 20. Model Damian matched his mother in an all-black ensemble consisting of a shirt, trousers and a leather bomber jacket.
