Staff and guests at a Cornwall pub and hotel have been evacuated after a fire erupted at the premises. Eyewitnesses have told of "loads of fire engines" arriving at the scene at Pier House Hotel in Charlestown on Friday evening. St Austell Brewery has released a statement confirming that the blaze is still raging but added that firefighters are at the scene. In a statement on Facebook, Chief Executive Kevin Georgel of St Austell Brewery said: "We can confirm that a fire has broken out at the Pier House this evening. This is a live incident and Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service are currently on the scene. "All staff and guests have been safely evacuated from the site and we’ll keep you updated as the situation develops further in the coming hours."  As Cornwall Live reports, the Pier House Hotel also had a fire incident in 2019 when flames erupted between the ground and first floors of the building. Emergency services responded, with firefighters forced to cut away floorboards to locate and tackle the blaze. The Pier House Hotel is located on Charlestown’s Georgian harbour. It started as a farmhouse in the late 1800s, but was acquired by St Austell Brewery in 2016. After a £380,000 refurbishment, it reopened in 2018.
