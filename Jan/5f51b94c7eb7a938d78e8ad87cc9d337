A racist thug branded a judge a "f*****g rat" in a foul-mouthed rant after begging for his prison sentence to be reduced so he could look after his dog. Ilias Turner, 48, was jailed for one year at Liverpool Crown Court for deliberately reversing his van into a car before unleashing a tirade of sickening racist abuse at another motorist. The court heard Turner had made arrangements to have the dog put down if he was locked up. Recorder Paul Taylor, who was told Turner has a total of 78 previous convictions, sentenced the yob and banned him from driving for 18 months. He is required to pass an extended retest before he is allowed back on the roads, Liverpool Echo says. The judge said: "Yours is a sad case, a man of 48 who has to live in a van during the winter. There is never a good time, but the idea of sleeping in a van in weather like this is disturbing. "When something happens to you that you don't like, you kick off. That is what you did in this case." But Turner, shouting from the dock, said: "It's not going to help me your honour. Could I please ask you to please lower the sentence? "Please - I beg you, please. At least my dog will have a chance then. "You're a f*****g dog-faced c***. You've more or less killed my dog you f*****g rat."  Turner had backed his vehicle into another on purpose in Toxteth, Liverpool, on August 9, 2021. The defendant then got out of his van to remonstrate with the other driver and spat at his window, before telling another man at the scene: "Go back to your f*****g Arab country, you f*****g Muslim - terrorist rats." Rebecca Smith, prosecuting, said Turner  also made alarming threats towards a probation officer that he would send indecent images to his phone. Turner, formerly of Edge Hill, Liverpool, was convicted of dangerous driving and racially-aggravated harassment by a jury. Simran Garcha, defending, said her client was living in his van with his dog and had "made arrangements" to have the "elderly" pet put down if he was locked up. She added: "Mr Turner accepts using language, in particular calling him a stupid Arab. "He apologises to the court for such conduct. He accepts that if he had handed the situation differently it would not have escalated quite in the manner it did. "There is no escaping that Mr Turner has an unattractive record. He is under no illusions as to the seriousness of the situation he finds himself in. "He used to be a user of heroin, however he is currently drug-free to his credit. He fears he may be drawn back into substance misuse if remanded into custody and may fall into future offending on his release. "Mr Turner experienced an extraordinarily traumatic childhood. It is clear that his upbringing has impacted on him significantly."
