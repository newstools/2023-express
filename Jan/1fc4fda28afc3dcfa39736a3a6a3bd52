Rita Ora, 32, showed off her toned physique despite the frosty conditions as she stepped out in London in a crop top earlier today. The Anywhere hitmaker braved the cold in a white crop top that featured a cut out cleavage, putting her abs on full display. Rita donned a tailored black and white pinstriped blazer in an oversized fit that she teamed with a pair of leather-look jeans. The pop star completed the look with a pair of black patent platform boots that added some height to the Hot Right Now hitmaker. Rita accessorised the edgy look with a black chain shoulder bag, silver rings and curtain earrings, as well as a chunky silver necklace and a grey knit scarf.
