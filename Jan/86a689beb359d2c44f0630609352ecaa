Manchester United's January transfer window is finally underway with the official signing of Jack Butland, but their search for a striker rolls on. It's now being reported that they've given up on trying to sign Joao Felix on loan from Atletico Madrid due to the huge fees needed to make it happen. Vincent Aboubakar has been linked following his reported release from Al-Nassr, but Wout Weghorst is also now on their radar. The Netherlands international was loaned out to Besiktas from Burnley for the entirety of this season. But the 6ft6in forward appeared to wave goodbye to Besiktas fans in his last match, indicating a move was on the horizon. Anthony Martial remains the only recognised central striker at Old Trafford and Erik ten Hag has made it clear that he wants more options. “I think we have a good team when all the players are available but with many games coming up, I think there is a need [for another forward],” Ten Hag said. “But you need one who can have an impact, otherwise you are just burning money and you don’t strengthen the squad and it doesn’t help you.”
