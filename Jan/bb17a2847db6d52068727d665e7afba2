A skier has died in the US after an avalanche struck and buried him in snow on an off-piste route. The man - who has not been named by rescuers - was with his father when the huge snow slide struck, engulfing them both. The partially buried father was able to dig himself out and skied to find help, but rescuers with specially trained dogs were unable save his son. They had been on an off-piste "backcountry" route called The Numbers outside the popular Breckenridge Ski Resort in Colorado on Saturday. The state accounts for one-third of all avalanche deaths in the US since 1950. In a post on Facebook, the Summit County Rescue Group said: "They were caught in an avalanche at approximately 1pm, with the father partially buried and the son fully buried. "The father was able to dig himself out and had to ski out of the area to get cell phone reception for the 911 call, which he made at 1.40 pm. "A probe line was formed to find the son and the onsite command confirmed that the subject was found by a dog team at 3.11pm, deceased. "All rescuers were out of the field by 4.38pm."

Avalanches occur in the high mountains of Colorado as the result of snow accumulating on steep slopes. Peak 10, which the two men had been skiing on in The Numbers, is the last and highest of the numbered mountains of the Tenmile Range, near Breckenridge, at 13,633ft. The lower slopes of Peaks 7-10 comprise the popular Breckenridge ski area, with the top of Peak 8 hosting the resort’s high point.
