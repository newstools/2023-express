A driver found themselves in a difficult situation when their truck became stranded on a beach. Visitors to the popular tourist spot said the large vehicle became stuck in the sand yesterday, January 3, and remained there overnight.   Captured on camera, the white and grey truck was parked on Porth Beach in Newquay, Wales, with the front end appearing to be stuck. Clint Osborne, who took the picture, first noticed the vehicle at 4:32pm yesterday, and witnesses on Facebook said it was still there this morning. He told Cornwall Live: "I had just been for a meal at the Headland Hotel with a friend from Wales, showing her some beautiful sites and we came down just before dusk and saw the lorry parked on the beach. "I was very surprised and that’s when we took the photograph. "I just could not believe a seven-and-a-half tonne vehicle was parked that far into the sand, I gasped in amazement with my friend." The Porth Beach webcam showed the truck was still stuck in the sand at around 10:30am today, January 4, but by 11:30am, it appeared to have been freed and moved. It is the first incident of this kind this year, but Porth Beach, which does actually have a car park on part of the sand, has become notorious for beach parking fails, which has seen dozens of cars stranded in the sand. Just last summer, an AA van got stuck in the sand alongside a car it was trying to recover from the same beach. The recovery driver worked alongside a group of people trying to dig the van out of the sand. Seemingly less than a metre away next to it was what appeared to be a white Ford C-Max which also stuck in the sand. Over the Easter holidays last year, it took half a dozen people to free a blue Volkswagen Transporter van on Porth Beach, and just a few days later a Mazda was trapped there too.
