Britain has been put on alert as Vladimir Putin is shifting the focus of his war from Ukraine onto Nato and the West, according to a leading EU official. His comments come in the wake of the US and Germany's decision on Wednesday to provide tanks to Zelensky's army. Stefano Sannino, secretary general of the European Union’s European External Action Service, said that as a result of the supply of Western advanced weapons to Ukraine, Russia has "moved from a concept of special operation to a concept now of a war against Nato and the West." He added: “I think that this latest development in terms of armed supply is just an evolution of the situation and of the way Russia started moving the war into a different stage." In providing military equipment, the EU as a whole and other nations are “just giving the possibility of saving lives and allowing the Ukrainians to defend (themselves) from these barbaric attacks."
