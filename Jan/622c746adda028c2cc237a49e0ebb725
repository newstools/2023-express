Infighting is breaking out at the top of the Russian chain of command as Vladimir Putin is accused of “stealing the victory” of the controversial mercenary Wagner group. The Russian Defense Ministry today proudly announced the capture of the salt mining town of Soledar in a key victory for the tyrant’s siege of nearby Bakhmut - but the Wagner group, who were not mentioned in the announcement, claim they captured it on Wednesday. Yevgeny Prigozhin, a rogue millionaire who owns the Wagner Group, has recently ramped up his criticism of Putin’s war effort, and took the opportunity to complain: “They are constantly trying to steal Wagner's victory.” The 61-year-old, known as “Putin’s chef” for his lucrative catering contracts and wanted by the FBI for meddling in the 2016 presidential election, claims Wagner is more efficient than regular troops, ramping up pressure on the Russian president - whom Prigozhin is tipped to replace in the event of a coup. A recent reshuffle of Russia’s top brass has been described by the US-based Institute for the Study of War has an attempt by the Kremlin to “reassert the primacy of the Russian Ministry of Defense in an internal Russian power struggle” and signal to Prigozhin to back down.
