UFC star Conor McGregor has revealed he was hit by a car while out riding his bike, sharing footage of the aftermath of the incident on social media. McGregor, who has been recovering from a broken leg sustained in his trilogy bout with rival Dustin Poirier in 2021, said he was hit by a car from behind after the driver was blinded by a "sun trap" and could not see him. In a post on Instagram, McGregor shared an image of his bike on the ground as well as two videos where he appears to be speaking with the man who was driving the car. "Got a bang of a car just now from behind," McGregor wrote. "A sun trap, the driver couldn't see me. Full spreed straight thru me. "Thank you God, it wasn't my time. Thank you wrestling and judo also. Having an awareness on the landing saved my life."

Don't worry about it. That's nasty. I could have been dead there." The man then offers McGregor a lift home as the UFC star shows that his trousers were ripped after coming off his bike. Friends and fans were quick to share their shock at the incident, with McGregor's fiancee Dee Devlin writing: "Beyond blessed babe Jesus Christ!!" Former UFC fighter Kenny Florian added: "Glad you’re ok man, wtf!" While fellow ex-UFC fighter Paddy Holohan wrote: "Someone up there watching over ya".
