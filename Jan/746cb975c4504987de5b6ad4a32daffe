It looks like Nintendo could start 2023 with a bang, as rumours of an imminent reveal gather steam. If the latest reports are anything to go by, Nintendo is tipped to make a big Metroid announcement in the coming weeks. The upcoming Nintendo Direct would focus on the Metroid Prime series, including Metroid Prime 4, which has been missing in action since it was announced all the way back in 2017. The news comes from reliable Nintendo insider Fun_Way_6592, who previously leaked Skyward Sword, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, WarioWare: Get it Together, and Splatoon 3. In a post on Reddit, a moderator claims to have received the following teaser fromÂ Fun_Way_6592: "Do you think everyone is primed and ready?" The message subtly hints at an imminent Metroid Prime announcement, most likely during the next Nintendo Direct event. While Nintendo has already announced the development of Metroid Prime 4, there are rumours that remastered versions of the first three Metroid Prime games are coming to Switch. The release of the rumoured Metroid Prime Trilogy would be the perfect way to prepare for the upcoming sequel, which has experienced a rocky development period. After its initial announcement back in 2017, Metroid Prime 4 was scrapped and handed to a new developer the following year. Nothing has been shown of the game since, leading to speculation that it may have been cancelled. Fortunately, the latest leak suggests otherwise. Indeed, it looks like Nintendo is finally ready to showcase its next big project. As it stands, anybody looking to find out more about Metroid Prime 4 can sign up for updates on the Nintendo website.
