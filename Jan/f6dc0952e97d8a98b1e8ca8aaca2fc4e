B&M has announced an early sale on Easter-themed chocolate, and some fans were not impressed. The retailer shared the news on its social media account last week. Last Thursday, December 29, B&M shared a photo of a collection of white Crème Eggs on its Instagram page. The photo was accompanied by the caption: “Do we need to say anything in stores? “Probably yes – Cadbury White Creme Egg, in-stores now – in December - for 49p each. “If you're still reading this... run to B&M before they're gone! Who fancies one?” Easter is not until April 9 this year, but B&M thought it fitting to start selling white Crème Eggs in December. The reaction to this was varied, with some customers unimpressed by B&M’s decision, while others seemed as if they couldn’t wait to try the chocolate delights. Lisa Evans wrote on Instagram: “This is wrong way too early. #stillcelebratingChristmas.” Instagram user @machinzoe wrote: “So wrong on all levels.”  At the time, Alison Coombes said: “For God's sake, give it a rest, we've not even had New Year yet.” Instagram user @michk44 commented: “Push push push… more marketing for Easter." Instagram user @vhenson1 wrote: “Make it stop!” User @shimere_84 said: “No! No! No! It’s still Christmas! At least wait until the 12 days are over.” User @marie_birbeck wrote: “Haven't even took me Xmas decs down yet [sic].” Stacey Twinem said: “Seriously, give it a rest, Xmas was not even a week ago, it's not even the New Year and there's Easter stuff... just no.” Elaine Fuller commented: “Way too early… get them off the shelves.” Lyndsey Houghton added: “Nope, nope, nope. Easter eggs are for March onwards.” However, user @mood4fooduk wrote: “I’m dreaming of a white Crème Egg.” User @jeanette1236 seemed to agree. They said: “Yummy!” User @mrsclarkescleaning commented: “I’m on my way.” Meanwhile, user @sarahs_sw_diary added: “Love them.”
