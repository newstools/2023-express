Prince Harry made a gesture in a recent interview that indicates he feels he is superior to Prince William, a body language expert has claimed. Adrianne Carter watched an interview with the Duke of Sussex did with Anderson Cooper for CBS’ 60 Minutes earlier this month. The host had said: "You write about a contentious meeting you had with him [Prince William] in 2021. You said ‘I looked at Willy, really looked at him, maybe since the first time since we were boys, I took it all in, his familiar scowl which had always been his default in dealings with me, his alarming baldness more advanced than my own'." Ms Carter watched this clip and claimed: "So we see a really telling clue from Harry’s facial expression when he talks about William’s baldness - we see the one-sided half smile. That means 'I feel superior, I’m better than'. He’s quite proud of the fact he isn’t as advanced bald as his brother."
