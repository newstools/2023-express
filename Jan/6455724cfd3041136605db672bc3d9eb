Members of the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (CSP) went on strike in an escalation of industrial action by health workers in their long-running wrangles with the Government.  The action by staff from 30 trusts across England will be followed by a second strike on February 9, while CSP members in Wales will stop work on February 7. The CSP said it has been calling for meaningful discussions over a better deal since the summer, with the original pay award half the current rate of inflation at 10.5 percent.  It added that the NHS is experiencing a “disastrous workforce crisis” and warned it is damaging the ability of staff to deliver high-quality care. Claire Sullivan, Director of Employment Relations at the CSP, said: “The Government’s strategy is entirely to blame for these strikes. It is gratifying the public recognises where the fault lies.” Health and Social Care Secretary Steve Barclay said: “I will continue meeting with unions to discuss what is fair and affordable for the 2023/24 pay process.”  Senior oncology physio Hayley Kidger has never seen the NHS in a worse state. In one week, nine of her 18-strong team at Queen’s Medical Centre, Nottingham cried at work due to stress and poor pay. She said: “NHS trusts should not have to have food banks or posters on coping with poor mental health. “That shouldn’t be the norm but it is.”
