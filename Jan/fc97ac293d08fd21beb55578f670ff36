Princess Martha Louise of Norway has been reflecting on a "challenging year" after stepping down from her royal role. The 51-year-old, who is the daughter of King Harald V and Queen Sonja, took to Instagram to give her followers a New Year's message. She said: "2022 was a challenging year for me in many ways. "It was also a year filled with joy, happiness and love. "Life has its challenges. No one can escape them, but it is up to each and every one of us how to meet those challenges. "When we manage to meet everything with the love from our core, we manage to rise above the fear, the disturbance, the anger, grief and everything else. "But the times we can’t live from our core, from love, we sink into despair, loneliness, anger, judgement and life’s challenges."

"I sincerely hope 2023 expands our deep love for each other. "We all need to build a world where all of us can breathe freely, be who we are meant to be, grow and expand into our true selves from love. "When we build our lives from our core of love, we start respecting ourselves and in turn we respect and love others in a new and more profound way. "Without judgment. Let 2023 be the year we step into love and shower ourselves with doing things that make us happy." Her fiancé Shaman Durek, 48, commented on the post. He wrote: "Oh my God, love! You light up the room like 10 thousand diamonds. You keep it fire. Slay!" Shaman added: "Your words speak the truth. Love is all there is above all things let us ride that wave all the way baby.
