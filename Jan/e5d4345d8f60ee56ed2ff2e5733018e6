Britons can usually fill in gaps in their National Insurance record up to six years after the year they are topping up for. Any gaps further back cannot be filled in. At present, this means the oldest year that can be filled in in 2023 would be as far back as 2017. But for a limited time this is extended back another 10 years, to 2007, with this extra window to close on April 5, with the start of the new tax year. This only applies to those who receive the new state pension, who have reached or who will reach their state pension age after April 5, 2016. A person may want to consider making voluntary contributions to top up their National Insurance record, as someone with 10 missing years could pay out just over £8,000, but would get a £55,000 boost to their state pension over a 20-year retirement.

With the payment increase, the full new state pension will increase to £203.85 a week. A person typically needs 35 years of contributions to get the full new state pension. The current state pension age is 66 for both men and women, with plans in place for this to increase to 67 and 68 over the coming years. The next increase to the state pension age is scheduled to take place in stages between 2026 and 2028, when it will increase to 67. It will then go up again between 2044 and 2046, to 68.  Ministers are set to publish a review into the state pension age this year by May with some predicting the age increases could be brought forward. Becky O’Connor, director of Public Affairs at PensionBee, said Britons “have to decide” if they want to retire earlier than when they receive their state pension. She told Express.co.uk: “The state pension delivers a maximum of roughly £10,000 a year. So if you still wanted to retire at 65 but won’t get the state pension until 68, you’d need at least an extra £30,000 in your pension to make up this shortfall. “The Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association thinks you need around £12,800 a year for a minimum lifestyle in retirement and £23,300 for a moderate one, as a single person, to give you an idea of the total you might need for each year you are retired. You can see the difference the state pension makes to reaching these targets.” READ MORE: 'Tried-and-tested' tips for cutting food shop as high food prices 'can't be undone easily' Research from the association found a person would need £12,800 a year for a minimum standard of living in retirement. Those who want a moderate standard of living would need £23,800 a year while those who are planning a comfortable retirement need £37,300 a year. Mark Devlin, senior technical manager at M&G Wealth, said it is “essential” for people to have a clear plan for when they are going to retire. He told Express.co.uk: “Just because the state pension age can be up to age 68 doesn’t mean that you must work until then. “Personal pensions can be accessed at age 55 currently, increasing to age 57 in 2028. The value of tax relief and employer contributions can really help to build up savings. “Extra savings could be made to 'bridge' the gap between retiring and state pension age. This may include ISAs/bonds/OEICSs as well as pensions and will need to for those wanting to retire earlier than 55/57. “It’s key to have this planned out as early as possible, as the earlier you start the less you have to save.” The triple lock was reinstated last year meaning state pension payments will rise 10.1 percent in line with last September’s figure for inflation. The policy guarantees the state pension increases each year in line with the highest of 2.5 percent, the rise in average earnings or the rate of inflation.
