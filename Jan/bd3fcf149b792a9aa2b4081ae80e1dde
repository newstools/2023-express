Antonio Conte has insisted he feels "proud" to be Tottenham manager after sending a direct message to the board and Daniel Levy over his future as the club's head coach. The Italian was notably more jovial after watching his side beat Fulham 1-0 at Craven Cottage on Monday night to stay in the hunt for a top-four finish and suggested he wants to stay on in his role. The 54-year-old was more subdued than his usual passionate self on the touchline, although he continued to bark out instructions as his side held on for a fairly comfortable 1-0 win thanks to Harry Kane's goal. The striker produced a moment of class just before the half-time interval, receiving the ball from Son Heung-min and striking a low effort into the corner on the swivel to go level with Jimmy Greaves on 266 goals for Tottenham in total on his 300th Premier League appearance. Spurs lacked the attacking panache to go on and kill the game but looked like a Conte side as they battled to protect their lead, with the back three of Eric Dier, Ben Davies and Cristian Romero remaining solid.
