It’s now been well over a year since Daniel Craig bowed out as James Bond in No Time To Die. Since then there have been rumours swirling over who his replacement could be, with Aaron Taylor-Johnson continuing to be the frontrunner at the bookies. This has been the case since a number of reports that he’s had secret meetings with EON Productions’ Barbara Broccoli. According to The Sun’s sources, Taylor-Johnson impressed the Bond producers and had an audition involving the famous gun barrel intro. The 32-year-old, who is the right age to begin a career as 007, is well-trained in action movies having starred in Kick-Ass, Bullet Train and Avengers: Age of Ultron. He’s also on the cusp of being the sort of Hollywood A-lister who can lead his own big-budget movie. Whether he’s announced or not, there’s also a rumoured period of when the next Bond will be revealed to the public for the first time.
