  Yesterday morning, the Italian dancer looked dapper in a black blazer as he headed out into the street. Meanwhile, this year’s Strictly winner looked stylish in a black skirt and long, black coat, which she paired with some heeled boots. The pictures follow claims that the pair were caught kissing backstage during the filming of the star-studded BBC show. It has been claimed that the two professional partners have been dating behind the scenes, with a source suggesting that Jowita had wanted to keep the romance on the down-low so as to not distract from her performances with Hamza.  The two champions reportedly made their relationship clear at a birthday dinner for Chelsea footballer Jorginho, however, who is a friend of Giovanni’s. A source said that the pair were “flirting and made their relationship very known” and that it was “the talk of the evening". They went on to claim that Jowita and Giovanni’s pals and co-stars have known about their budding romance for a while, adding that they make a “great couple”. “While they both kept insisting they were single, the pair’s chemistry was ridiculous — and they kept getting busted snogging in corridors,” they told The Sun.  “Crew even saw them kissing in the production office. They make a great couple though, and have been pretty inseparable in the last few weeks. “Jowita, especially, wanted to keep things quiet so she could keep focused with Hamza, and not distract from the competition.” Express.co.uk have reached out to representatives of Giovanni and Jowita for comment.
