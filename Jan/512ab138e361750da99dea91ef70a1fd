The former Sports Illustrated swimsuit model demonstrated today her model looks as she approaches 70. The leggy model offered her best tips to help maintain her age-defying looks. In a recent photo set she donned a bright red swimsuit, similar to Pamela Anderson's iconic Baywatch look, which was tied at her waist with a rope belt. Every aspect of her look was the same shade, from the cover-up she slung on her shoulders to her bright red toenail polish. Meanwhile, she shared that her secret to a fabulous figure involves regularly riding a bike and taking walks on the beach. The former pin-up star looked a mere fraction of her age and, judging by the broad smile on her face, she is living the words in her caption: "68 and grateful."
