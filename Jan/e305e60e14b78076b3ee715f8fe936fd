Zara Tindall, 41, and Mike Tindall, 44, enjoyed another sun-filled day on Australia's Gold Coast on Tuesday. The royal couple were seen enjoying a stroll while Zara looked ready for action in her Magic Millions polo shirt and white trousers. The daughter of Princess Anne then changed into her riding boots ready for the Magic Millions beach gallop in Surfers Paradise, Queensland. Zara looked in her element as she joined celebrities and VIPs on horseback and enjoyed the stunning scenery on the beach. Zara was pictured greeting the crowds who gathered to watch the event. She could not have looked happier, especially as she was dodging the royal drama at home amid the release of Prince Harry's controversial memoir, Spare.
