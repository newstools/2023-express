Inheritance tax is often referrred to as one of the most hated taxes in Britain as people often feel it leads to being taxed twice - once when the money is earned and another when a person dies and passes wealth on. Currently, the HMRC threshold is £325,000 - yet a modest property can sell for £295,000 - meaning more people are being forced to pay the tax. Laura Suter, head of personal finance at AJ Bell, said thresholds haven't risen in almost two decades yet house prices have soared, leading to more people being forced to pay inheritance tax. She said: “The deep freeze on inheritance tax thresholds until 2028 means they won’t be increased for almost two decades. "During that time we’ve seen house prices soar – with the average property price in the UK rising from £156,000 in 2009, when the current nil-rate band was set, up to £295,000 today. "This highlights how someone in a relatively modest home could easily hit the threshold with their property alone."

Ms Suter added: "Increasingly this impacts the moderately wealthy – as those with large estates are covered by other thresholds and allowances and can afford professional help to minimise their bill. “Death duties are a decent cash cow for the government, generating £2.38billion in 2009 to 10 but rising to £6.1billion last year. While falls in property prices are expected to limit growth in the next few years, the OBR expects it to generate almost £7 billion a year over the next six tax years. “It’s crucial for people to maximise their allowances and gifting rules to reduce the size of their estate, where possible. No-one should be giving money away that they may need later in life, but there are myriad tax breaks that people can utilise to avoid handing more of their money to the taxman.” DON'T MISS:Santander has increased interest rates for savers [UPDATE]Reducing thermostat can knock £300 off energy bills a year [ALERT]Pensioners urged to be ‘strategic’ as tax can apply to state pension [WARNING]  Prior to the 2010 General Election, the IHT-free threshold had increased steadily, rising from £250,000 in 2002 to £325,000 in 2009. In 2007 Gordon Brown also introduced the transferable nil rate band, effectively doubling the threshold for a married couple. However, the transferable nil rate band remains unchanged since it was set at £650,000 in 2009 and will now be frozen until at least April 2028. Had the government done nothing other than uprate the pre-existing transferable nil rate band since 2010, the IHT-free threshold for a couple would be £1,004,000 million by 2028. Alex Davies, CEO and Founder Wealth Club said it's not just the super-rich who are affected by these changes, thousands of hardworking families will be worse off. He said: “Freezing the inheritance tax threshold for yet another two years – until April 2028 – is another kick in the teeth for those wanting to pass down their wealth to loved ones. "We believe that this extended freeze combined with rampant inflation will increase average IHT bills to £297,793 in 2025 to 26 and to £336,605 in 2027 to 28. "Contrary to what many think, inheritance tax doesn’t just affect the super-rich. It will be the thousands of hardworking families to bear the brunt, as they get caught in the cross hairs of high property prices and frozen IHT allowances."
