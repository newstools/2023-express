Prince Harry has been pictured leaving the studios following his interview on The Late Show, which saw him drink Tequila shows with host Stephen Colbert. The interview, which will broadcast in the US tonight, saw the Duke of Sussex answer a series of questions from the late night host in his Colbert Questionert segment. Some of the questions his guests are asked include what their favourite sandwich is, what app they most use on their phone and what number Colbert might be thinking at that point in time. It is not known what Harry's replies were but people at the recording at the Ed Sullivan Theatre in New York City filmed some of the segment where Harry was speaking with two tequila shots he later downed. The prince has been doing a series of interviews in the US as he looks to promote his bombshell book, Spare, which has now officially gone on sale. On Monday the Duke of Sussex, wearing a grey suit and navy shirt, was pictured walking from his SUV into the studios to meet Colbert. CBS announced: "The interview will be Prince Harry's first time visiting The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and coincides with the release date of his new memoir, Spare.    The PR team added: "With its raw, unflinching honesty, Spare is a landmark publication full of insight, revelation, self-examination and hard-won wisdom about the eternal power of love over grief." Earlier in the day, Harry was seen leaving his Manhattan hotel, where rooms start at $400, rising to $3,500 a night for a suite. But there was no sign of his wife Meghan Markle, or young children Archie and Lilibet, who are believed to have stayed at home in California.
