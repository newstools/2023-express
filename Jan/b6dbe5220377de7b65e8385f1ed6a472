A two year old has died in what's believed to be a tragic choking accident. The alarm was raised at 9pm yesterday evening when the young boy started having difficulties at a family home in Skibbereen, County Cork, in southern Ireland.  While emergency services rushed to the scene, the child couldn't be saved, reported the Irish Mirror. Gardai, Ireland's national police service, have said his death is not being treated as suspicious. A spokesman said: "Shortly after 9pm, on Wednesday 25th January 2023, Gardai attended at a domestic residence in Skibbereen, Co. Cork, following the sudden death of a male toddler. "The Coroner has been notified and a post-mortem will be held at Cork University Hospital. Gardaí are currently treating the death as a tragic accident and foul play is not suspected. Owing to the tragic nature of the incident no further information is available." The death comes just two months after a five-year-old boy died after swallowing a notice board pin in South Yorkshire. Kyle Lewis, five, tragically lost his life after three days of fighting in Rotherham General Hospital. After he began suffering from multiple seizures and a rise in temperature, a scan showed that between 90 to 95 per cent of his brain had been damaged after he swallowed a notice board pin. He died only six days after his fifth birthday.

Emma Lewis, Kyle’s mother, said: "I can't even explain how I feel. I'm broken beyond words. It doesn't feel real. I don't want it to feel real. They kept him on life support until we were ready to say goodbye. But you’re never ready are you?"
