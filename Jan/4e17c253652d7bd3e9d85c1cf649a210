The former prime minister said the sooner the West helps Ukrainians to their “inevitable victory” the sooner their suffering will be over and the world can begin to recover. Mr Johnson said it means “all of us in the West” must “double and treble our support”. He said: “When Ukraine wins, that is a message that will be heard around the world. So let us help them win, not next year or the year after, but this year, 2023." The Conservative MP dismissed any concerns about the cost of supporting Kyiv. “If you want to minimise the world’s economic pain, if you want to avoid the enormous cost – in blood and treasure – of letting this tragedy stretch on, then let’s together do the obvious thing," he said. “Let’s give the Ukrainians all they need to win now." Mr Johnson, who made a surprise visit to Ukraine on Sunday, insisted the UK has “set an example for other countries to emulate” after sending 14 Challenger 2 tank. But he said the Ukrainians need hundreds of tanks and they should be getting them from the Americans, the Germans, the Poles, and many others. Berlin has so far refused to sign off the export licences allowing other countries to send German-made tanks to Ukraine. Mr Johnson said it is “not our job to worry about” provoking Vladimir Putin or engaging in “pointless Kremlinology”. “He has no restraint,” Mr Johnson said. “He has no scruple. He has long since abandoned the slightest respect for the laws of war – and with every day that goes by, more innocents are sacrificed, more brave Ukrainian soldiers are killed and more young Russians are fed into the maw of his meat-grinder. “So let me pose the question again. What conceivable grounds can there be for delay? Why are we not giving the Ukrainians all the help that they need, now, when they need it?”
