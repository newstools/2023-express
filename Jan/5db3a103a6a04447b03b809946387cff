Happy New Year, and happy new transfer window, with the beginning of January bringing with it the promise of another hectic month of wheeling and dealing. Premier League sides up and down the country will be plotting their moves, and have 31 days to improve their squads before the window slams shut again until the summer. Liverpool have already secured the services of Cody Gakpo, but could well have their eye on further reinforcements as Jurgen Klopp attempts to drag his side back into contention for major honours. The Reds are notorious for moving quickly to secure their targets, and anything could happen in the coming weeks. Chelsea, meanwhile, are continuing to pursue Argentina's World Cup hero Enzo Fernandez. His club Benfica appear to be close to accepting defeat in their attempts to keep the midfielder until the end of the season, and it will be intriguing to see how negotiations progress. Manchester United are another team expected to be busy, with their need for a No.9 no secret. Manager Erik ten Hag will no doubt demand action sooner rather than later. And with the likes of Tottenham, Arsenal, Leeds and Newcastle also likely to splash the cash, there could be plenty to discuss in the near future.
