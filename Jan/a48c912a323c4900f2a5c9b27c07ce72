The former soap star has temporarily relocated to Berkshire with her hubby and kids to take part in the ITV series but admits she feels “quite scared” about the task at hand. Patsy, 50, who starred as Bianca in EastEnders, said: "I'm not competitive but this time I'm gonna say 'let's try and win it'. "I will focus on the training and use meditation and this will really put it to the test for me." She added that after turning 50, she made a "pact to get out of my comfort zone", saying: "This is for all the 50-year-olds. I'm actually quite scared now." The star moved to the US with her husband Richard Merkell and their children Fenton, 22, Emilia, 21, and Bertie, 12, back in 2014. Until recently, Patsy trained at ice rinks in Los Angeles, with professional partner Matt Evers, who is also based in the States. Now living near Windsor temporarily, she is beginning a gruelling training schedule ahead of the show's launch.  Also donning blades in series 15 will be ex-footballer John Fashanu, 60, Love Island winner Ekin-Su Culculoglu, 28, Olympic bronze medal-winning gymnast Nile Wilson, 26, Coronation Street actress Mollie Gallagher, 25, and Towie's Joey Essex, 32. The line-up is completed by Liberty X singer Michelle Heaton, 43, winner of RuPaul's Drag Race UK, The Vivienne, 30, soap actress Carley Stenson, 40, comic Darren Harriott, 34, and Siva Kaneswaran, 34, of boyband The Wanted. Hosted once again by Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield, the new series welcomes back skating professionals Sylvain Longchambon, who last took part in the 2019 series, and Vicky Ogden and Kiabera Komini, last seen in the 2021 series. Olympic skaters Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean, Diversity dancer Ashley Banjo and ex-Strictly Come Dancing professional dancer Oti Mabuse are all returning to judge the increasingly daring routines. Dancing On Ice starts Sunday January 15 at 6:30pm on ITV1 and ITV.
