With the festive season behind us, Valentine's Day is the next event on the calendar, and it's a great time to cheer up the cold season and celebrate. There are lots of options for different types of gifts, ranging from the traditional flowers, chocolates and alcohol, to experiences to enjoy together. If you're looking for pampering gifts to help with self-care, a candle, electric blanket or Oodie is a great choice, or giving an addition to their skincare or makeup routine is always a welcome treat. For those looking for a shared experience, Red Letter Days has plenty of spa days, weekend breaks and foodie outings.  A survey by OnePoll found that 47 percent of women say they like to receive flowers on Valentine's Day and 43 percent say they would like to receive chocolates, plus 67 percent say they like to enjoy a romantic dinner.  While traditional gifts like boxes of chocolates are still a popular choice, for those looking for a more unique option, choosing a personalised gift such as a dressing gown with your partner's initials, or engraved jewellery can help add an extra touch to show that you really care. If you think the receiver of the gift would prefer spending quality time together, an experience gift such as a lunch, spa day or mini-break could be a good choice. There are plenty of options when it comes to affordable gifts, with chocolates, prosecco and gin coming in at under Â£25, and for experience gifts, there are options to suit every budget.
