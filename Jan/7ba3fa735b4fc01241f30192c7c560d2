Joelinton has admitted a drink-driving offence during a hearing at Newcastle Magistrates Court.. The 26-year-old Newcastle United midfielder was pulled over by police around 1.20am on January 12 in Newcastle.  Northumbria Police said: "Shortly before 1.20am today, officers pulled over a vehicle in the Ponteland Road area of Newcastle and arrested the occupant. Joelinton Cassio, 26, of Ponteland, has since been charged with driving whilst above the prescribed limit for alcohol."  During the hearing Joelinton admitted to drinking two glasses of wine earlier in the evening before he was pulled over. Jonathan Stirland, prosecuting said an unmarked police car was "drawn" to Joelinton's car in the early hours of the morning. Mr Stirland said: “The sergeant formed the view that the car was speeding or going too fast for the road. It caused him [the sergeant] to turn his vehicle around and followed the Mercedes on to the Central Motorway."   The Brazilian was fined £29,000 and been banned from driving for 12 months. He has also been offered the drink drivers’ rehabilitation course, which, if completed, will knock 12 weeks off his ban. District Judge Paul Currer, sentencing said the offence could have had "disastrous consequences" adding that he "sincerly hopes" he has learned from his mistakes. He add: “This type of offence is always regarded seriously by the court. That’s because, when you drove your car while over the prescribed limit, you were not in a position to control it properly or react as you normally would to any dangers or obstacles you may have encountered.”   A large media presence gathered on Thursday morning ahead of the 26- year-olds arrival. The apperence comes just 48 hours after he scored the winner in Newcastles win over southampton in the first leg of the Carabao Cup semi-final.
