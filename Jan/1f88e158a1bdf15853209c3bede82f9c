This assistance is available through the Government’s Cold Weather Payment scheme which is currently running. Usually, households receive just £25 to help with their rising energy bills but certain families could get as much as £75 over the course of this winter if they are eligible for the latest trigger. This comes as gas and electricity costs have increased by 27 percent since October 2022, even with the Government’s price guarantee in place.

As it stands, if someone were to receive one instalment of the Cold Weather Payment, they would receive £25 in energy support. Someone is eligible for this payment if they experience a seven-day period of sub-zero temperatures in their local area. Cold Weather Payments are reserved for those on low income who receive certain qualifying payments from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). Among the qualifying benefits are Pension Credit, Income Support, Income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance, Income-related Employment and Support Allowance, Universal Credit and Support for Mortgage Interest. Residents in Scotland are no longer eligible for Cold Weather Payments but could get an annual sum of energy bill support through the Winter Heating Payment. This payment will be a yearly amount of £50 to those who receive certain qualifying DWP payments. READ MORE: Recession fears continue despite UK economy growing Anyone eligible for a Cold Weather Payment will receive the sum automatically; they should not need to apply for it. All payments will be awarded to the bank or building society account within 14 days of the trigger. Britons can access the Government’s Cold Weather Payment webpage and use the postcode checker to check their eligibility. If someone does this, the tool will ask what part of the UK they live in - England, Scotland or Wales. Residents from Northern Ireland should use that part of the UK’s own website to check whether they can get a Cold Weather Payment.  Richard Neudegg, an energy expert at Uswitch.com, shared why Cold Weather Payments are a useful tool to combat rising energy bills. He explained: “With temperatures dropping rapidly, it’s important to track your energy usage and change your habits in a safe and manageable way while keeping warm.” “The payments go to the most vulnerable people in areas where the mercury has plunged to zero degrees Celsius or below over seven consecutive days. “Nearly £100million was paid out in 2020-21, and higher bills this winter mean the payments are more valuable than ever this year.”
