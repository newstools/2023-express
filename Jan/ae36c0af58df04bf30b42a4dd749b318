A cave in a popular park has been cordoned off by police. Forensic officers have been pictured at Old Nick's Cave, a grotto in Sefton Park, Liverpool. It is understood emergency services were also at the scene yesterday. People in the park reported seeing an ambulance near the grotto. Several patrol cars have been pictured at the scene today which is inside a large cordon. A video shows a police car arrive at the scene and a bike has been spotted within the cordoned off area. The cave, which is gated, is an example of a Victorian rockwork cave, which as Liverpool Echo says were formerly popular in public parks. A reporter for the publication said: "A solitary forensic officer is working within the right of the cave. The whole grotto area is cordoned off and a bike is within it." It is believed the grotto was built in 1870. Sefton Park is a large park in the south of Liverpool, designated by English Heritage at Grade I in the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. It was created in 1872, just two years after Old Nick's Cave was built.  We'll be bringing you the very latest updates, pictures and video on this breaking news story.
