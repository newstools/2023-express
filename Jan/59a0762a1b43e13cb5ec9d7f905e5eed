Great-grandad John McOwan, 101, was delighted to finally receive the Legion D’Honneur. The former Desert Rat only realised he was entitled to the award after joining other veterans in Normandy to mark the 75th anniversary in 2019. But due to application delays, John almost gave up hope of receiving it. Ill health forced him to miss a ceremony at the French Embassy before the pandemic. But, finally, after 78 years and with assistance from Sight Scotland and Legion Scotland, his valour has been recognised. The retired jewellery shop owner said: “When it came in the post it was a complete surprise. It was the best Christmas gift. “I hope this might encourage other veterans to apply. My family are very proud and my great-grandchildren wanted to know more about my story.” Dad-of-one John, of Peebles, Scottish Borders, planned to train as an optometrist after leaving school. But he joined the Royal Artillery aged 18 in 1939, shortly before the Second World War. He was transferred to Egypt in 1940 after helping to defend the Forth Rail Bridge. John used his engineering skills on tanks, trucks and other equipment with the 7th Armoured Division and was involved in the Normandy landings when tens of thousands of Allied troops landed on five beaches on June 6, 1944. John and late wife Betty had a daughter, three grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. He has written a memoir which he published last year. John added: “I was really proud of my service and wanted to dedicate [this] to my great-grandchildren. “You often hear from people who knew nothing about their father’s or grandfather’s experience and wishing they had asked them more about it.”
