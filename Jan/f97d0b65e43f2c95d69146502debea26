  The Strictly Come Dancing finalist showed off her ageless physique in a plunging black swimsuit, which included glitzy gold belt and halterneck. She posed beside her friend Jade Towns, who matched Denise with her blonde hair and all-black ensemble. Another photo showed the former Big Breakfast star wearing a white robe as she enjoyed a relaxing massage. “The Coach House spa @beaverbrook,” she captioned the snaps with a heart emoji, referencing the luxury hotel and spa set in 470 acres of countryside in the Surrey Hills. Fans took to the comments section to compliment the star, with Lauren writing: “Denise you look glowing, happy and healthy.” “Wow you look amazing Denise,” Steph penned, while Luke added: “What a milf.”
