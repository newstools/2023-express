Ginny and Georgia is back on Netflix and Gil Timmins had been in prison for fraud and embezzlement. Austin (played by Diesel La Torraca), would write letters to his father but his mother Georgia (Brianne Howey) would not send them. Season two of the TV hit finally put a face to a name as Gil was seen on screen as part of a dramatic storyline. The new season saw Gil out of prison as he confronted Georgia about their relationship problems. Austin was caught up in the middle of the feud and it escalated to the point of potential disaster. Gil is played by Aaron Ashmore, a 43-year-old Canadian actor who is known for his roles in Smallville and Warehouse 13. The star is the identical twin brother of actor Shawn Ashmore, who has been in the X-men films as Iceman.
