  The Met Office has issues a yellow warning for snow and ice as weather forecasters warn that temperatures are expected to be colder on Tuesday. The coldest weather has been recorded in Dalwhinnie in Central Scotland at -9.1C, as temperatures were below freezing in Edinburgh and Belfast but is expected to be milder in both Cardiff and London.      The UK Health Security Agency has put out a cold weather alert until 9am on Friday, and has urged people over 65 and with pre-existing conditions to keep their homes heated "if you can". In a statement, the agency acknowledged that some people may not be able to afford heating bills or may not be able to warm their homes for any reason. However, if able to, the public is urged to try and keep their living rooms warm and also bedrooms heated before they go to sleep. The agency advised: “Wearing several layers of thinner clothing will keep you warmer than one thicker layer. Having plenty of hot food and drinks is also effective for keeping warm."    Dr Agostinho Sousa, head of extreme events and health protection at UKHSA has also warned about the impact of the cold and urged people to check on loved ones. He said: “Cold weather can have a serious impact on health, particularly older people and those with pre-existing health conditions, as it increases the risks of heart attacks, strokes and chest infections. “During this period, it is important to check in on family, friends and relatives who may be more vulnerable to the cold weather. “If you have a pre-existing medical condition or are over the age of 65, it is important to try and heat your home to at least 18C if you can.” READ MORE: 'At least eight shot' in reported MLK day shooting   The Met Office has said that sub-zero temperatures at night are expected to last until the end of the week, with the UK also experiencing snow and icy conditions.
