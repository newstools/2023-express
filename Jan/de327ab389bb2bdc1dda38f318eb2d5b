Taking a break from the Has Fallen series and freed from awkward US accent obligations, Gerard Butler takes flight as a super-tough pilot who crash-lands on a Filipino island overrun by gun-toting rebels. Former RAF man Brodie Torrance (Butler) is a commercial flyer who was sidelined by the military for being Scottish (is that a thing?), then his new bosses sentenced him to captaining late-night routes out of Asia after he put an unruly passenger in a chokehold. For now, the widower has put the search for redemption aside. His only concern is to arrive home in time to scoff New Year “haggis, neeps and tatties” with his grown-up daughter. But fate intervenes when his money-grabbing boss orders him to fly his passenger plane through a storm, instead of detouring around it, to save money on fuel. After a lightning strike fries the electrics, the plane plunges and Brodie heroically lands it on a dirt track on an unknown island. Amusingly, this improbable feat isn’t appreciated by his passengers, an international bunch who find common cause with an extended moan about delays and catering. More worrying is the brooding presence of Mike Colter’s ex-military hardman Louis Gaspare who was being extradited to the US to face a murder charge. His guard was killed in the descent. Instantly sniffing out a fellow action man, Brodie unlocks Louis’s handcuffs so he can accompany him into the jungle to survey the terrain. After a gang of trigger-happy, ransom-seeking islanders kidnap the passengers in their absence, Brodie and Louis partner up to rescue the ingrates. French director Jean-François Richet keeps the action tense, thrilling and reassuringly preposterous.
