Tyson Fury's promoter Frank Warren has revealed a blockbuster heavyweight unification bout against Oleksandr Usyk is edging closer after a draft contract was sent to the Ukrainian's team.        Fury currently holds the WBC heavyweight title having dethroned Deontay Wilder in February 2020, while Usyk is the WBA (Super), IBF and WBO heavyweight champion having beaten Anthony Joshua for the belts in September 2021. And after both Usyk and Fury successfully defended their titles in respective bouts against Joshua and Derek Chisora, the pair appear to be on a collision course. Following his win over Chisora, Fury called out Usyk, who was ringside, and Warren is confident the fight will take place in March. Speaking to talkSPORT, Warren said: "We've sent them a draft contract, that's where we're at. Listen, it's gotta be sorted out very, very quickly now because the time is against us."

We just want to get it on in March and that'll set them up for another big fight in the autumn." Warren also admitted a venue has not yet been decided, but said the fight will be staged "wherever the most money comes from". And while Fury fans will be desperate for the fight to take place in the UK like his two previous bouts, Saudi Arabia has also been touted as a potential destination. When asked about the likely location, Warren added: "Wherever the most money comes from. Nothing's in place from anywhere outside the UK.

I know a lot of people complain about it and I agree it should be at Wembley, I'd love to see it there. "But Muhammad Ali and George Foreman went and fought in Zaire, then you had the Thrilla in Manila, you had the big fights in Jamaica. They went where the money was and these guys will do the same thing."
