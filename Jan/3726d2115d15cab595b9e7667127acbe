Mo Gilligan, Davina McCall, Rita Ora and Jonathan Ross were all stumped when it came to guessing the identity of Fawn on The Masked Singer. But after a few maths clues, ITV viewers are certain former Countdown star Carol Vorderman is hiding under the mask. Fawn was a sweetly dress deer, who had a brown and white jacket on and sported a bow on her head. Completing her costume were fluffy leg warmers and brown and white spotty trousers. In her clue package, Fawn teased: “Like a fawn, I admit that when I was young I was a bit awkward. “Call me a boffin, but maths was a passion... that my brain later helped me to win later in life.

After her performance, Fawn teased the judges and viewers even further with a riddle. She said: “I live in a cottage, but not in a palace... I visited Wonderland, but my name isn’t Alice.” Amongst the guesses from the judges were Spice Girls singer Mel C, former Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng and Hannah Waddingham.
