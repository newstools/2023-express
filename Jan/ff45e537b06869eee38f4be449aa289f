Amanda Holden, 51, stood out from the crowd on Monday morning as she headed to work at Heart FM. The presenter wore a red bodycon midi dress from Reiss paired with matching court heels and a long red coat. Once she arrived at the studios, Amanda took to her Instagram Story to show off the look with her fans. She said: “Good morning, happy Monday! On Monday’s we wear red, fitted clothes despite having a massive roast dinner on Sunday." Amanda wore her blonde hair straight and accessorised with gold jewellery to match the detailing on the dress.
