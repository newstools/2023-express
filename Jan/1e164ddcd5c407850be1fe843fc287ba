Jacket Potato is among this year's The Masked Singer stars to have ITV viewers scratching their heads, but one theory has suggested the identity could be none other than rock legend Billy Idol. One fan took to Reddit to explain their guess - could they be right? Jacket Potato made their Masked Singer debut a couple of weeks ago, and gave a few clues to viewers. "Like all good spuds, I'm smooth, creamy and occasionally baked," he commented. "What I do is like a marathon and man, do I need that energy," Jacket Potato continued. Posting their prediction on social media, fan and Reddit user u/ASeriousRedDuck wrote: "I previously mentioned in a comment or two about some of the things I picked up in his clue package that has lead me to believe [Jacket Potato] is Billy Idol.

"The part where he was seen reading Romeo & Juliet by William (Bill) Shakespeare, also he has a lyric in the song 'Cradle Of Love' which mentions Romeo. "The Wild Hog patch on his jacket (Billy had a terrible motorbike accident, not sure if he still rides or not)." Could the singer be Jacket Potato on this series?  The contestant has divided opinion, with a number of names thrown into the mix.

Jacket Potato sang Viva Las Vegas during his first appearance, which led to an array of guesses from the judges. Comedian and The Masked Singer judge Mo Gilligan guessed Jack Whitehall and Sean Paul, while Rita Ora believed the hidden famous face was American. However, she went on to guess David Dickinson. Meanwhile, Jonathan Ross guessed Shane Richie or Mary Berry and Davina McCall went with Alex James. The Masked Singer continues on Saturday at 7pm on ITV.
