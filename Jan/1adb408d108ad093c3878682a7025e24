The phrase “white van man” has long been associated with tradespeople who drive smaller light commercial vehicles, but is often connected with negative connotations. But the term could soon disappear after new figures revealed sales of white vans are on the wane - while the popularity of bronze models and electric vans are on the rise. Data from the DVLA show registrations of white light commercial vehicles have decreased by 34 percent over the past five years. During the same period those of bronze-coloured small vans have shot up by a staggering 215 percent - making it the fastest-growing shade across the board. Darren Jasper, head of commercial vehicle leasing at Select Car Leasing, commented on the data, saying a change in demographic is one of the main reasons. He said: “This news could sound the death knell for the term ‘White Van Man’, and that’s no bad thing.

Vehicles included were in tax classes 39 (Light Goods Vehicle) and 36 (Euro 4/5 Light Goods Vehicle).

The number of white models first taxed in 2018 was 187,260, but by the first 11 months of 2022 that had dipped to 122,795. Silver models went from 43,410 down to 14,985, while black van numbers descended from 31,198 in 2018 to 18,263 this year. Meanwhile, bronze was the only colour to see a rise - from 209 five years ago to 658 in 2022.

UK new light commercial vehicle (LCV) registrations reached 282,139 units in 2022, a decline of 20.6 percent on the previous year of strong post-pandemic bounceback. The research, from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), found that 16,744 battery electric vans were registered in 2022. This represents 5.9 percent of all vans joining UK roads last year and showed deliveries up 31.2 percent. There is an ever-increasing number of electric van models available for a broad range of use cases, helping drivers and businesses reduce their emissions. However, uptake remains some way off the new car market, where BEVs comprised 16.6 percent of new registrations
