Tory MP Chris Skidmore has urged the UK to “step change” its approach to meeting net-zero climate targets. The former science minister is set to recommend long-term goals and immediate action the Government should take in the next two years as part of a review of Britain’s 2050 emissions target. But do you think the UK is doing enough to reach net zero? Vote in our poll. A leaked copy of the report, due to be published on Monday, recommends a fivefold increase in solar power by 2035, scrapping of planning rules for solar panels, “eco-labelling” more environmentally friendly foods, an earlier phasing out of new gas boilers by 2033 and longer-term funding for net-zero projects. Mr Skidmore states that the transition to a low-carbon economy is “the industrial revolution of our time” and has urged the Government to commit to supporting this in the 340-page report, arguing that the benefits outweighed the cost.

A government spokesperson said Mr Skidmore's report “recognises the Government progress that has been made to date in working towards legally binding net-zero targets.” Business and Energy Secretary Grant Shapps said of the report: “The UK is well placed to ensure that tackling climate change also brings new jobs and investment for businesses and communities. I am grateful to Chris Skidmore for his detailed report today, which offers a range of ideas and innovations for us to consider as we work to grasp the opportunities from green growth.” So what do YOU think?
