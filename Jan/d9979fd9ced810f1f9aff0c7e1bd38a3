  Carol showed off her ageless physique on Instagram as she entered the studios of the popular radio show today. The BBC Radio Wales presenter stunned in a monochrome, long-sleeved top and paired it with some tight black trousers. Amanda looked divine in a figure-hugging, hot pink dress as she welcomed Carol onto the show. The Britain’s Got Talent judge paired her frock with some pointed, pink stiletto heels and opted for a glossy make-up look. Amanda made a cheeky reference to the way she was “holding on” to Carol, as she seemed to have her hand resting on the Pride of Britain host’s bosom as they posed for pictures together.
