A woman has allegedly cut off her husband’s penis and left knives jammed in both her dead partner’s eyeballs. Florencia Amado Cattaneo, a 41-year-old psychology teacher has been sent for a psychiatric assessment after being arrested for murder in Argentina.   Pedro Federico Zarate, 47, was found dead in his house in La Plata with several parts of his body mutilated as well as deep wounds in his chest, according to local reports. Investigators reportedly found the victim lying on the couple’s double bed in the top floor of his flat in Altos de San Lorenzo. Ms Cattaneo, the suspect, is alleged to have fled the scene on January 11 in a car and travelled to her mother’s house in Gonnet where she was arrested on Wednesday night. She allegedly arrived at her mother's place with blood covered all over her hands.

We were shocked. At no time did we hear of such an act of violence in the house." The couple had been together for over a decade and reportedly had a five-year-old-son. She has been admitted to a psychiatric ward in a medical centre in La Plata to undergo tests which will determine whether or not she can be charged, said investigators. Today forensic experts have continued working around the flat in search of evidence. The victim was a musician who played the trumpet and a human rights activist, local reports say. Local reports have said there is footage of Cattaneo arriving at the police station with a grimace on her face. She was wearing a jacket over the top of her dress, despite it being a warm day. The victim reportedly worked at the Estacion Provincial Cultural Centre since 2016 and got married to the suspect in April 2011. Additional reporting by Maria Ortega
