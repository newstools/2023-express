 The stunning Hollywood couple welcomed their third child last Friday and revealed her name, Esti Maxine Stephens, last night. Chrissy Teigen, 37, and John Legend, 44, shared a sweet snap of the newest Legend on Instagram, noting: “The house is bustling and our family could not be happier.” Baby Esti could be seen being cuddled by her older siblings as she lay wrapped in a white blanket with an adorable pink beanie and matching gloves. Fans were whipped into a frenzy by the double-revelation, as some wrote up puns for the newborn, writing she was “born into the bEsti family” and “don’t underEstimate her” while thousands offered their congratulations and well wishes. Celebrities were also affected by the baby fever, as Viola Davis, Angela Bassett and Kris Jenners congratulated the family. The model’s last pregnancy in 2020, with son Jack, tragically saw the couple losing their baby at 20 weeks, making Esti’s arrival all that more special. The couple heartbreakingly admitted the older Legend children, Luna, 6, and Miles, 4, “don’t quite understand” where their younger brother went, but are ecstatic for the newest arrival.
