Incredible footage captures a huge humpback whale pop up to the surface right by a fisherman's boat off the coast of Cornwall. James Tanner, 25, said it was a "pretty special moment" to witness the creature bob along the water on Monday afternoon. The giant of the sea came to within touching distance of James' "Tidos" boat, an 18ft structure he keeps registered in Falmouth, Cornwall. James, who has been fishing since he was 15, told Cornwall Live: "I spoke to the old fishermen out of St Ives and all of them said they've never seen any humpback whale swim in St Ives Bay. Some have been fishing these waters for 70 years or more so it's quite something. What a great track record to have. "I reckon the whale was double the size of my boat. It's huge. It was just incredible. It popped up to the surface and was probably about a metre or so away from the boat. Then, just like that, it was gone again and swam back out of the bay again. It was a pretty special moment." James, who 10 years ago saved a man from drowning after he tipped over on his kayak, comes from a family of proud fishermen that goes back several generations. James, from St Ives, Cornwall, said he had posted a video of himself feeding a huge tuna fish which had come up to the side of his boat a few years back, but the reaction it got was never anything quite as when posted the video of the 36ft humpback whale. The fisherman, who also runs Nemo Glass Boat trips in the summer months, added: "There is a lot of feeding in the bay. There must be a lot of fish and bait for this whale to come here, which is good. My dad and granddad were fishermen and his dad before him too. It's not just a job, it's a lifestyle." James' dad, Peter Tanner, has been fishing in St Ives Bay for decades. He said: "I've never seen anything like this. All I ever saw was black pilot whales. But having this huge humpback whale come up to right next to the boat is pretty amazing."
