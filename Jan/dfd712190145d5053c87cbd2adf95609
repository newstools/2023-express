As inflation rises and the cost of living crisis continues, many Britons are putting the prospect of owning a home or moving house on hold. High mortgage rates have also caused house sales to drop to a 12-year low which could lead to a decline in house prices this year. In December, prices fell by 1.5 percent compared to November, meaning the average house price is now £281,272, according to Halifax.
