Police have arrested a fourth man on suspicion of the murder of Cody Fisher, who was stabbed to death in a Birmingham nightclub. The 18-year-old was held in Erdington just before 7am today and will be questioned over Mr Fisher's death.  Mr Fisher was stabbed on the dance floor of the Crane nightclub on Adderley Street in Digbeth just before midnight on Boxing Day. The 23-year-old died at the scene.   Two men have already been charged with his murder, while a third has been released on bail while police inquiries continue.   Detective Inspector Michelle Thurgood, leading the investigation, said: “We know lots of people at The Crane were using their mobile phones to take pictures and video on the night.   “If anyone has images from the evening that shows what happened before, during or after the incident, we really need to see it. It could provide vital to our investigation.”   West Midlands Police has set up a dedicated web page where people can send information, photos and videos that could help the investigation.        Mr Fisher played as a defender for Stratford Town FC, a team in the Southern League Premier Division Central. The talented left-back was previously part of Birmingham City FC's academy and played as a Walsall FC youth trainee before making senior appearances for Stratford Town, Stourbridge FC and Bromsgrove Sporting.  Mr Fisher's girlfriend Jess Chatwin posted an emotional message on Twitter the day after his death. She wrote: "You didn't deserve any of this. I'm so sorry this has happened to you my baby please come home. I love you forever Cody Fisher."   A statement published by the police and attributed to Mr Fisher's family said: "They have broken our hearts; I have lost my best friend. "My family and I are asking for privacy and respectfulness at this heart-breaking time." Life-saving bleed kits are being installed at several nightclubs and venues in Birmingham after the killing, which led to Crane's licence being withdrawn. The kits were donated by the Daniel Baird Foundation, a charity started by Lynne Baird after her son Daniel was murdered with a knife in Digbeth in July 2017.   Two men have already appeared in court charged with the 23-year-old's murder, while a third has been released on police bail. Kami Carpenter, 21, and Remy Gordon, 22, were charged with murder five days after the death of Mr Fisher. Both have been remanded in custody to face a trial due to start on July 3.
