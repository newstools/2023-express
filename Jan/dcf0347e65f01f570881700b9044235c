A teen has launched her dream business after renovating a rundown horsebox into a mobile coffee shop. Amelia Vasey had a lightbulb moment when she spotted the vintage 1960s horsebox in 2021 while on her travels. Following an impressive remodel with the help of her dad, the 18-year-old now hopes to expand her coffee and cupcake business even further, reports Hull Live. The horsebox initially had no floors and was an empty shell, but Amelia, with the help of her dad, who has a keen passion for DIY, transformed the vintage box into her dream venture. Explaining that her dad is an electrician, Amelia said: "He just loves projects and helping people out".  The restoration, which took just under ten months to complete, has rendered the vintage horsebox unrecognisable thanks to the installation of lights, including "Mimis" in large LED lights. With a fresh layer of paint and many hours constructing the inside, Mimi's Horsebox was created. Amelia, from Kirk Ella, East Yorkshire, then sourced a great find in a second-hand barista-style coffee maker so that she could start trading in August 2022, even attending some of the biggest events in Hull during her first few months.   Mimi's Horsebox's first event was street food event Yum Festival, hosted in Hull Marina in early August. This was followed soon after by Humber Street Sesh, and happy customers have been telling the teen how delicious her coffees, milkshakes, and cupcakes are.  Looking to the future, the young entrepreneur hopes to cater big events such as weddings. Amelia said she would also love to turn Mimi's into a bar, installing some beer taps as well as creating some delicious cocktails. Mimi's Horsebox is now available to hire for functions, weddings, and events, for dry bar or catered. For more information, you can find their Facebook page here.
