Stacey Solomon, 33, looked worn out as she cradled her youngest children - Rex, three, and Rose, one - on the sofa. The Loose Women panellist showed off her blossoming baby bump as she added in the caption: "Fingers crossed Rose gets a good night sleep tonight." Earlier in the day, Stacey opened up about how little Rose has been "really struggling" with teething over the last few days. Thankfully, in a later post Stacey updated fans that she is "slowly feeling more like herself". It comes after Stacey shocked her fans when she announced she is eight months pregnant with her fifth child. The baby will be her and husband Joe Swash's third child together and the new arrival is expected in the coming weeks.
