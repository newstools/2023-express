We may only be a week into 2023, but Niantic is already holding its first Pokemon Go Community Day event. If you're a Pokemon Go fan looking to grab a new shiny with an exclusive move or two, then you'll be pleased to hear that the next Community Day event takes place at 2pm GMT UK time on January 7. Running for three hours until 5pm, the January Community Day shines the spotlight on grass-type Pocket Monster Chespin. As part of the Community Day event, Kalos starter Pokemon Chespin will appear more frequently in the wild. Players will also be more likely to encounter a shiny version of the Gen VI Pokemon. Furthermore, if you're able to evolve Quilladin (Chespinâ€™s Evolution) during the event, you'll receive a Chesnaught with an exclusive Charged Attack called Frenzy Plant. As long-time Pokemon Go fans will be aware, there's more to Community Day events than frequent encounters. January Community Day bonuses include double candy for catching Pokemon, as well as shorter egg hatching distances. Elsewhere, Lure modules and Incense will last for the duration of the event, while less Stardust will be needed for trades. Speaking of trades, Trainers can make one additional trade during the event. It's even better news for level 31 Trainers and above, who are much more likely to receive XL candy when catching Pokemon. Niantic also urges players to take a snapshot or two during the event. You might just receive a surprise. And don't worry if you happen to miss the event, because there's still a chance of catching Chespin in its shiny form. "After the three-hour Community Day event ends, Trainers will be able to take on special four-star Raid Battles," Niantic explains. "Claiming victory in one of these raids will cause more Chespin to appear around the Gym that hosted the raid for 30 minutes!"
