Throughout Amanda Holden's 16 years as a judge on Britain's Got Talent, the 51-year-old has donned countless gowns that have both stunned, and ruffled, plenty of viewers. Her most risky looks include a sexy Julian MacDonald dress that she wore in 2017. The sheer gown featured a plunging neckline that fell all the way to her navel, baring almost her entire chest. After Amanda wore the daring dress to the Britain's Got Talent semi-finals, she sparked a record-breaking 663 Ofcom complaints. Nevertheless, that didn't stop her and she has gone on to amp up her daring fashion choices ever since. Here's a rundown of some of her most famous looks, including a hot pink latex dress and malfunction-dodging yellow midi that she wore to the BGT auditions last year. Amanda will return to TV screens tonight with her brand new series, Amanda and Alan's Italian Job, alongside Alan Carr. It airs at 8:30pm on BBC One.
