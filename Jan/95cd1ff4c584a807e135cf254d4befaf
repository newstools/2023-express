Border Force insiders expect at least the same number of individuals will make the dangerous Channel crossing as last year. But the 45,000 figure is the lower level of the forecast with the upper limit reportedly tipped to reach 80,000 in Whitehall projections. The prediction comes as the Home Office prepares a crackdown on illegal migrants working in the black market. Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick will lead a new taskforce to use "every available power" to ensure "only those eligible can work, receive benefits or access public services". The work will develop Theresa May's "hostile environment for illegal migration" that was halted during the Windrush scandal.  It will mean bank checks on the immigration status of account holders will be reinstated and a review of laws to stop casual jobs, such as food delivery drivers, being exploited by people without permission to stay in the country. The taskforce will also look at ways to make sure employers are carrying out the proper checks on the immigration status of their staff as well as access to rented housing, bank accounts, healthcare, education, driving licences, and public funds. Mr Jenrick said: "Illegal working causes untold harm to communities, cheating honest workers of employment, putting vulnerable people at risk and defrauding the public purse. â€œOur immigration enforcement teams are working to bring those violating our laws to justice. It's our priority to crack down on this crime and empower law enforcement to remove illegal migrants."
