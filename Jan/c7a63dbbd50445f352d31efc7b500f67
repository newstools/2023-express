Babylon's leading lady Margot Robbie stole the show in an eye-catching red cape gown as the blonde beauty hit the red carpet with her co-star Brad Pitt. The 32-year-old wowed in a stunning red Valentino gown as she made a glamorous arrival alongside a dapper Brad, 59. The on-screen star made sure all eyes were on her as posed for pictures in the sweeping gown which featured a backless design and halterneck top. Margot accessorised her look with dramatic makeup wearing the perfect red lip and wore her light tresses pinned back with pretty tendrils around her face. Brad looked smart in a checked grey suit and shirt as he made his way to the red carpet for snaps.
