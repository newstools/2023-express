Letters written by Diana, Princess of Wales revealing her torment at a “desperate and ugly” divorce from Prince Charles are set to fetch £90,000 at auction. The messages include veiled digs at the Royal Family for isolating her and show fears that her phone was being bugged.  In all, there are 32 letters and cards written by Diana in 1995 and 1996 to her friends Susie and Tarek Kassem, who have now decided to sell them. The handwritten notes reveal the Princess’s heartache over her divorce. In one, she writes: “I am having a very difficult time and pressure is serious and coming from all sides. It’s too difficult to keep one’s head up and today I am on my knees and just longing for this divorce to go through.” Another states: “It is difficult to discuss personal issues as my lines here are constantly recorded and passed on. If I’d known a year ago what I’d experienced going through this divorce I never would have consented. It’s desperate and ugly.”  In another, she thanks the Kassems for letting her spend Christmas 1995 with them while William and Harry were with their father. The haul is being sold at Lay’s Auctioneers in Penzance, Cornwall, on February 16. The proceeds will go to charities.
