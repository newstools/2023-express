Prince Harry will never be allowed back into the Royal Household after the explosive allegations he made against the Royal Family, a royal expert claimed. The Duke of Sussex took aim at individual members of the Royal Household in his memoir 'Spare', attacking his father King Charles, his stepmother Queen Camilla and his brother Prince William. In the aftermath of such claims, royal expert Richard Fitzwilliams says talks of reconciliation between Harry and his family are now "impossible". Speaking to Express.co.uk, Richard Fitzwilliams said: "No one will trust him. How could you? I mean, it's impossible. There's no way. I don't think they want to anyway. "He talked about a possible Commonwealth role but no one could trust him. "They can't say anything to him at all confidentially and especially after attacks like these, no." Asked how Prince Harry could make amends with his family and re-join the Royal Household, Mr Fitzwilliams said: "It won't happen after that [the book] and Netflix and Oprah." Harry and his wife Meghan Markle have been accused of going on a crusade against royals with a series of projects, including US and UK media interviews, Meghan's podcast, their Netflix series and now the Duke's memoir. In his tell-all book, Harry reveals he and his brother William begged their father not to marry Camilla, now Queen Consort. Harry alleges that he pondered whether she would one day be his "wicked stepmother", but that he and his brother were willing to forgive her in "their hearts" if she could make King Charles happy He also hit out at his brother who he accuses of grabbing his collar, ripping his necklace and knocking him to the floor at his London cottage in 2019 after William described Meghan as "difficult", "rude" and "abrasive", which Harry called "the press narrative." King Charles begged his two sons to stop fighting after yet another physical altercation between the two brothers in 2021 after the funeral of the Duke of Edinburgh. "Please, boys... don't make my final years a misery," he said, Harry claims in his book.

Mr Fitzwilliams said the Sussexes will "supposedly" receive an invitation but it is too early to tell at this time whether Meghan and Harry will be welcomed. A royal insider told The Sun that the family doesn't want Harry to be present at the ceremony in case their conversation "ends up" in another a book. Prince Harry has so far avoided saying if he would accept an invitation but has set conditions for healing the family rift. He told ABC's Good Morning America: "I don’t think that we can ever have peace with my family unless the truth is out there. There’s a lot that I can forgive, but there needs to be conversations in order for reconciliation, and part of that has to be accountability."

They told The Independent: "They are trapped. They really can't engage because everything they say will be shared with the media. It is impossible to have a conversation or write a letter because of the risk that anything they say being put in the public domain by Harry, potentially for commercial benefit." Meghan could be next in releasing her own memoir, the Daily Mail reported, with one source telling the publication the Duchess is "contemplating getting entirely candid about her time in the Royal limelight… and leaving no stone unturned." Buckingham Palace declined to respond despite a flurry of charges made by the prince in his book, Spare, and multiple media interviews.
