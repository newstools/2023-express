But horrifying new information came to light following his arrest when Ms Northington discovered that Kohberger had been a member of the Facebook group she was a part of.   She told News Nation host, Ashleigh Banfield: "That was shocking. Absolutely shocking. "I had no idea he was trolling the groups like that. That was shocking to me." Ms Northington said the discovery was "very creepy", and showed what a "sick-minded person" Kohberger is. She added: "Someone who can do this has to be very sick in the head. It's a game to him.

Before his arrest, Xana's mum said she had never heard of Kohberger and doesn't believe her daughter would have had an connection with the older Washington State University student. Northington told News Nation: "I can't imagine she had any connection with him.     "He's quite a bit older than her or any of her friends. I don't know if they knew him." She said her daughter could have served the suspected killer at the vegan restaurant, Mad Greek, where she worked. Kohberger was reported to have eaten at the restaurant shortly before the murders - but the owner has since denied seeing him.  Kohberger is accused of fatally stabbing the four students to death in their beds on November 13, and has been charged with four counts of first-degree murder and one count of burglary.
