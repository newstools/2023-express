Ashley Roberts, 41, looked fabulous in an all-pink outfit that showed off her rock hard abs as she stepped out in London earlier today. The TV star chose to wear hot pink trousers and a matching crop top, along with a long coat in the same colour. Ashley, who was photographed as she left the Heart FM studios, finished off the look with a pair of hot pink stilettos and accessorised with a pink handbag. She completed the stylish ensemble by adding a pair of dark sunglasses, while her hair was styled in voluminous waves.
