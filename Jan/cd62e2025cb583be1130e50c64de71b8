Prince Harry's admission of drug use in his tell-all memoir could put his US visa at risk. The Duke of Sussex - who now lives in California - opens up on taking weed, cocaine and magic mushrooms in the past in Spare. US visa rules state that an individual’s “current and/or past actions, such as drug or criminal activities . . . may make the applicant ineligible for a visa”. Leading US immigration expert Professor Alberto Benítez told the Telegraph: “He would have been asked [about drug use]. If he was truthful in his answers, he should have been denied." Prof Benítez warned Harry's visa could be "revoked" if he failed to declare the drug use. The US State Department told the Sunday Times: “All visa applications are adjudicated on a case-by-case basis." Meghan Markle is an American citizen but it is unclear on what grounds Harry lives and works in the country. He may hold a spousal visa, or a O-1 visa - for people with "extraordinary ability", which lasts for three years. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES ON THE ROYAL FAMILY:
