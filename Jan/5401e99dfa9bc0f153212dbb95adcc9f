A restaurant, once rated as Tripadvisor's best ranked in London, was actually created as a ruse and never saw a single customer. A Vice journalist named Oobah Butler created the entirely fictitious eatery named "The Shed at Dulwich" and then had a group of friends log positive posts and reviews of "The Shed" which helped make the venue number one on TripAdvisor for London. Oobah is an author and filmmaker and well-known for his clever and experimental media pranks. Another such story involved the writer pretending to be "Georgio Peviani" the Italian-sounding designer of a pair of jeans that he discovered in a London market, with the ploy to go to Paris Fashion Week, LADBible reports. In terms of his journey with the Shed restaurant, the venue turned out to be his own shed in his own garden and when the TripAdvisor ruse took hold, Oobah reportedly used a "burner phone" to handle phone calls and bought a domain for a website to build.   The Shed’ started as the lowest ranked restaurant at 18,149th in London, but 96 reviews later it had rocketed up to number one in London, without a single guest going through the door. Oobah told the Metro: "It was a lot of work, but if there’s one thing I will pour hours and hours into it’s a pointless joke. ‘The first 10 or 15 thousand went quickly, but I thought there was no way we’d get to number one." The paper reported Oobah purchased some ready meals from Iceland supermarket when he did eventually have to serve some customers. Rating website TripAdvisor responded to the 2017 prank with the statement: "Generally, the only people who create fake restaurant listings are journalists in misguided attempts to test us. As there is no incentive for anyone in the real world to create a fake restaurant it is not a problem we experience with our regular community – therefore this ‘test’ is not a real world example."
