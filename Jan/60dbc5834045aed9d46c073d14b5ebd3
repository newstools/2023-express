Speaking about both he and his brother not wanting their father to marry his Camilla, he said: “We didn’t think it was necessary.“We thought that it was going to cause more harm than good and that if he was now with his person that surely that’s enough. Why go that far when you don’t necessarily need to?“We wanted him to be happy and we saw how happy he was with her, so at the time it was OK.” Lorraine continues on weekdays on ITV from 9am
