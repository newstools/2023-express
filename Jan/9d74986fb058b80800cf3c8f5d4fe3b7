The January transfer window is almost a third of the way through and the majority of Premier League clubs are still hard at work behind the scenes to put their respective plans for the mid-season market into action. Just shy of £300million was spent by teams in England's top flight last January and it seems as though a similar outlay could be splashed on new players over the coming weeks as managers up and down the country look to prepare for the all-important run-in. Chelsea are said to be making significant progress regarding their pursuit of Joao Felix, who is widely expected to leave Atletico Madrid on loan before the January window slams shut. The 23-year-old has also been linked with a move to Manchester United but it seems as though the Red Devils will be forced to chase other targets in order to improve their attacking ranks in the near future. Arsenal, meanwhile, are believed to be closing in on a deal to sign long-term target Mykhaylo Mudryk from Shakhtar Donetsk, with negotiations still thought to be ongoing between the two clubs. The likes of Newcastle and Leeds United will also be looking to strengthen their respective squads as a matter of priority, but it remains to be seen which Premier League club will manage to take the biggest strides over the course of this month.
