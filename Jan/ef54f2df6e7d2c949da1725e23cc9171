The Government has frozen energy prices in a bid to provide respite to businesses and households. But the BRC fears that when Government support ends in April, retailers’ energy costs could soar by more than £7billion, with prices at the tills rising as a result. BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said: “2023 will be another difficult year for consumers and businesses as inflation shows no immediate signs of waning. “Retailers will continue to work hard to keep prices low.However, further high investment in prices may no longer be viable once the Government’s energy bill support scheme for business expires. “Without it, retailers could see their energy bills rise by £7.5billion. Government must urgently provide clarity on what future support might look like or else consumers might pay the price.” People have been buffeted by the cold weather, leaving them spending more on energy bills. At the same time they have seen the cost of essential foods soar due to the war in Ukraine, which is keeping the cost of animal feed, fertiliser, and energy high. Sue Davies from Which? said: “It’s hugely concerning that food prices are continuing to rise quickly. “Which? research has found millions of people are skipping meals or struggling to put meals on the table. “Supermarkets must ensure budget lines for healthy and affordable essential items are widely available.” However, while food prices soared the BRC data revealed non-food price inflation actually fell from 4.8 percent in November to 4.4 percent.
