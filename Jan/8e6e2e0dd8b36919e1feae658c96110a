Neil Giblin's body was found at his bungalow on the island of Koh Tao, Thailand often referred to as "Death Island". The 48-year-old diving instructor is believed to be the fifth instructor to have died on the island in recent years. Despite police saying he died of natural causes, friends have raised concerns over the number of unexplained deaths. Mr Giblin was found by two female clients after he failed to turn up for work on January 18. A friend told the Sun the fit and health instructor was found "in his underwear on his sofa". They added: "I was told the police said straight away there was nothing to investigate. It happened so quickly. I don't even think they did an autopsy. "This just doesn't add up to me. Nobody wants to question what the police said." A Koh Tao police spokesman said "there were no signs of a struggle". He said: "No investigation was made as the paramedics said it was natural causes." Tributes left to the instructor described him as a "positive" and "inspirational" person. Friend Shane Latham said: "My heart is totally broken right now by the news that one of my past diving instructors and mentors has passed away in Koh Tao. "Neil Giblin was such an inspiration to me and how I teach. I will always cherish our talks and his words of wisdom."
