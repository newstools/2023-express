Just as speeding drivers can avoid prosecution by attending a speeding awareness course, the Policy Exchange think tank wants litter offenders to be taught about the damage they cause. It claims that littering has increased by 500 per cent since the 1960s and costs the country £1billion. Around 730million items are littered each year, with roadside waste killing approximately 3.2million shrews, moles and mice. The minimum on-the-spot fine for littering should go up from £65 to £195, the report argues, with the maximum fine increasing from £150 to £450. It makes the case that if litter awareness courses are priced between £80 to £120, many people will opt to go on one rather than pay a punishing fine. The report calls for litter bins to be incorporated into bus stops, benches and lampposts. It also pushes for zero VAT on biodegradable plant-based chewing gum. Today, it states, biodegradable gum is “roughly three times more expensive than single use plastic chewing gum”. A further demand is a ban on synthetic cigarette filters.
