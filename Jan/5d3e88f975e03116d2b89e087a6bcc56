 Demi Moore, 60, and Ashton Kutcher, 44, became a subject of obsession for global audiences when they became an official item in 2003. However, the actor much prefers a more private life and when Demi released her memoir in 2019 he was “f***ing p***ed” that she had reignited the public’s interest in him.   Despite being arguably one of the most famous faces in Hollywood for most of his life, Ashton has maintained a relatively low profile over recent years. The That 70’s Show star and his current wife Mila Kunis, 39, have gone through great lengths to keep their professional careers separate from their private lives. The couple first started dating in 2012 but didn’t even walk a red carpet together until 2017, two years after they got married in a private ceremony. While media interest in the couple continued to dwindle, especially as Ashton stepped away from acting and into the business world, the family of four was suddenly thrust back into the spotlight in 2019.

In his latest interview with Esquire, Ashton exclaimed that he was “f***ing p***ed” about the renewed public scrutiny the memoir brought him and his family. The actor could even recall the very day the memoir had been released, as within 24 hours there was paparazzi at his children’s school. He said in Esquire’s first digital cover story: “I'd finally gotten to a place where the press had really laid off me and [Mila], and my life and my family.”     The star stopped himself from saying any more, noting that he doesn’t “want to open anything in that realm”. Ashton recalled how his “life changed” the very moment he and Demi went public with their relationship over two decades ago. Public interest peaked as Ashton was still riding high on the wave of fame That 70’s Show brought while people were intrigued by the 15-year age gap between the couple. The couple tied the knot in 2005, meaning Ashton was suddenly a step-dad of three, a pressure which he admitted was “a lot” to deal with.  He told Esquire: “I was twenty-six, bearing the responsibility of an eight-year-old, a ten-year-old, and a twelve-year-old. “That’s how some teen parents must experience their twenties.” However, the actor highlighted that he still keeps in contact with all three of his former stepchildren, now fully-grown adults. Ashton and Mila now also have two children of their own, Dimitri, six, and Wyatt, eight. 2019 was a turbulent year for the entrepreneur, as he developed a migraine that lasted for two weeks before eventually seeing a doctor.  His condition gradually got worse, with the actor reportedly struggling to hear, see and even walk before being diagnosed with vasculitis. The autoimmune disorder causes inflammation of the blood vessels according to the NHS with a range of effects, symptoms and severity. Inspirationally, the actor declared: “Whatever you’re going through, you have two choices: You accept this as part of the experience, or you reject it as part of the experience. "The minute you start rejecting it as a part of the experience, you start questioning reality. ‘This is not my problem. This is not my thing.’ Well, what reality are you living in if this is not yours?” Express.co.uk has contacted Demi Moore’s representatives for comment.
