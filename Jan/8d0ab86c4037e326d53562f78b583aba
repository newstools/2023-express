Kate was at an official engagement at a nursery school as part of her mission to encourage improved provision for children in their formative first five years. But it all looked like child’s play for the mother of Prince George, nine, Princess Charlotte, seven, and Prince Louis, four. Kate, who was wearing a £1,600 orange turtleneck wool Gabriela Hearst dress with a thick brown leather belt, ditched her £349 Massimo Dutti Limited Edition cashmere camel coat and got stuck into the mask-making activities with a group of three and four-year-olds. Praising one little boy’s efforts, she told him: “I think it’s very good – good job.” And she shared a high five with another youngster. Kate also talked to staff about their work at Foxcubs Nursery in Luton, Beds, and the effects of the pandemic when nurseries closed. She said: “I think families realised and communities realised...how vital they were.” She also paid tribute to staff for their “important” work and told them: “You are clearly doing an excellent job.” Kate later joined husband Prince William to pay tribute to Holocaust survivor Zigi Shipper, who died yesterday on his 93rd birthday. The couple, who met Mr shipper in 2017, tweeted: “He will be truly missed.”
