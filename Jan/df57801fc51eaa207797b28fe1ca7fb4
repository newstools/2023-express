Jake Paul has secured a deal to fight in MMA via the Professional Fighters League and has vowed to change the sport.  After compiling a 6-0 boxing record, with the most recent victory coming against Anderson Silva in October, the 25-year-old now wants to make waves in another combat sport. As reported by the New York Times, Paul will fight multiple times in the PFL as part of his deal, as well as becoming the 'head of fighter advocacy' in the promotion. It is unknown what the exact specifications of the role will be, but he is expected to make a big push to promote the MMA company to his millions of adoring fans across his social media channels. “This is about changing MMA," Paul told the outlet. "Disrupting, innovating, and creating the next big league. The biggest thing for me would be getting the kicks down. “But I’m going to start now, moving forward with some extra time I have within this camp. I’m going to put in some extra time, rolling around doing some jiu-jitsu and learning some kicks.” JUST IN: Jake Paul picks Tommy Fury replacement opponent before MMA debut  The PFL has branded itself as a "fighter-first" organisation since launching in 2017 and its new 'Super Fight' division will see fighters take home 50% of the pay-per-view revenue. Having now gathered some experience in boxing and having competed in amateur wrestling in Ohio, Paul is confident he can use his skills to dominate the Octagon.   Two 'Super Fight' shows are planned for 2023, but a date for Paul's first fight has yet to be announced but he also could feature in one of the planned blockbuster fight nights. Paul has called out free agent Nate Diaz with a fight between the two a possibility. "I'm so dedicated to this that I offered Nate Diaz a two-fight deal", Paul said. "First we box. Then six months later we fight MMA in the PFL. Nate Diaz, I am down to fight you in your own sport."
