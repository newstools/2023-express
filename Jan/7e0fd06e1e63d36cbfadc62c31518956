Amanda Holden, 51, shares two daughters with her husband Chris Hughes: Lexi, 16, and Hollie, 10. The Britain's Got Talent judge looks like the mirror image of Lexi who is set to be following in her mother's footsteps for stardom. Lexi, who recently attended the British Fashion Awards with her mother last year, signed a deal with modelling agency Storm. This is the same agency that helped start Kate Moss' career, with Lexi recently launching her own Instagram page to showcase her work. Amanda previously told Fabulous magazine: "At the moment, Lexi’s learning her craft — how to pose, how to walk. And then we will release her into the modelling world. "But she’s super excited and has the right mentality — she’s very unfazed by things, is not easily impressed, and doesn’t suffer fools."
