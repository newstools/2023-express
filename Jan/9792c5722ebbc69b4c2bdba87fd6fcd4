Tesco has issued a warning to anyone in the UK with a Clubcard. Millions of shoppers are Clubcard holders, regularly using them on trips to the supermarket, whether it be for a big shop or just a few items. But while people are racking up points, many are forgetting to use them before they expire. More than 2 million Tesco customers have now been reminded to spend more than £16 million worth of Clubcard vouchers before they expire at the end of February, reports Manchester Evening News. The vouchers, which were first issued in February 2021, will expire on February 28, and they will help households up and down the UK in what can be a tough time of year for family budgets. Customers can use their Clubcard vouchers to bring down the cost of their weekly shop or fuel, to treat themselves with more than 100 Reward Partners, including Pizza Express and Spa Seekers, or to pick up a great new deal with Tesco Mobile.    Tesco Loyalty Director, Tash Whitmey, said: "We want to help customers’ household budgets stretch further right now and Clubcard is the best way to get great value with Tesco – from Clubcard Rewards to thousands of exclusive deals through Clubcard Prices. "With more than £16m worth of Clubcard vouchers due to expire at the end of February, we’re reminding customers to spend them in what can be a tough time of year, as family budgets feel the new year strain."  It comes as Tesco shoppers have reportedly started boycotting one item section "on principle" after noticing a staggering price hike. Customers who enjoyed buying the bakery products such as flapjack bites, chocolate cornflakes clusters or millionaire bites said they were a lot more expensive now. Before, they claimed you could get any two of these items for £1 but Tesco reportedly increased prices to £1.50 for two and eventually sold sets of two for £2. At the moment, according to Tesco's website, these items are now priced at £2.25 each. However, shoppers insist they were two for £1 before,
