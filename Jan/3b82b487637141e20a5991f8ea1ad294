Wordle is back with yet another fiendish puzzle, and just in time for Sunday. The daily Wordle for January 22 is a tough one, and is almost certain to end to one or two winning streaks. If you're struggling with today's Wordle, then don't fret, because Express Online is here to help, courtesy of three spoiler-free hints to help you solve Wordle 582. Just head to the bottom of the page for those crucial clues. Good luck! The perfect game to play on a relaxing Sunday morning, the aim of Wordle is to figure out a five letter word in just six guesses. To solve the puzzle, you'll need to pay close attention to the colour of the tiles. If the tile turns grey, then the letter you've guessed doesn't appear in the final word. If it turns yellow, then the letter appears in the word, just not in that position. A green tile means the letter is in the word and in the correct place. An addictive game with a huge following, Wordle would go on to spawn dozens of clones. There's a Lord of the Rings themed Wordle called Lordle, a musical variant called Heardle, and a hardcore Wordle game called Quordle - where the aim is to guess four words instead of just one. If you're not great with words, then you'll prefer something like Nerdle, where you've got to figure out a maths equation.
