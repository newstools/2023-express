Many TV production studios are now looking to film in Calder Valley due to the success of the award-winning show, with the local council being inundated with filming requests. Tim Swift, leader of Calderdale Council, said: "Calderdale is known for its distinctive landscape, architecture and heritage, and when these are showcased on screen they become stars of the show, just like the characters. "We've seen a huge increase in requests from location managers and we're working hard to harness the borough's growing profile as a filming destination." Happy Valley writer Sally Wainwright has previously filmed Gentleman Jack in Calderdale - sparking a huge rise in visitors to Shibden Hall, the focus of the historical drama. Councillor Swift said: "All of Sally's series filmed in the area have had outstanding impacts... bringing millions of pounds into our local economy." The new six-episode crime drama, created by Ms Wainwright, returned on New Year's Day.
