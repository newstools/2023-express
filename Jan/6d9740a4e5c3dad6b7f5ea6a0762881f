Seven-time F1 world championÂ Lewis Hamilton will miss James Vowles' "clever thinking" after he left Mercedes to become the new Team Principal for Williams, according to Mercedes chief Toto Wolff. Vowles, who was Mercedes' Motorsport Strategy Director, worked alongside Hamilton for a decade and helped the Brit win six of his world titles before making a shock switch to Williams. And speaking at a press conference alongside Vowles, Mercedes Team Principal Wolff revealed Hamilton's reaction to the news of his departure. "I told him this week that this was going to happen and he is absolutely fine," Wolff said. "Working with James has always been a great pleasure for him. The clever thinking on a Sunday morning, that was good fun with James always. But he is absolutely... I think his first response was 'That's amazing for James'." Vowles, meanwhile, added: "For what it's worth, I called him [Hamilton] and those were the first words that came out of his mouth. Not insulting me or telling me he's disappointed, it was quite the opposite.
