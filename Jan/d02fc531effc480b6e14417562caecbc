Prince Harry has been accused of compromising the security of the Royal Family by describing the layout of various royal residences in his new tell-all memoir. Dai Davies, a former head of royal protection, has described the Duke of Sussex as a "fool" for revealing such information in his book, Spare. He has deemed the details as "dangerous" if they were to land in the wrong hands, in a report by the Telegraph. Prince Harry wrote how he carried an electronic tracker and a panic alarm at all times.The 38-year-old detailed the location of Queen Elizabeth II's bedroom at Balmoral and the precise location of how to get to the King's private sitting room at Clarence House from the entrance of the home. He also added the exact amount of stairs. Mr Davies, who worked in police and security for more than 50 years, said: "These revelations give me great concern and will likely give great concern to Prince Harry's current team".  Mr Davies claims that it makes the job of protecting him "problematic". He added that "only a fool" would expose this sort of information, especially since "there have always been people who hae tried to access parts of royal palaces".  He added that this sort of information could be useful to "fixated individuals" with "mental health problems" or "terrorists". He added: "There's a reason Buckingham Palace never discusses any detail about its security operations, big or small. "It would never expect anyone with such an intimate knowledge of private royal residences to disclose such information." In his book, Harry also recounted the first time that his father and stepmother Charles, Queen Consort, met the Duchess of Sussex. He detailed how they were led "down the long corridor" by a butler and a house manager.
