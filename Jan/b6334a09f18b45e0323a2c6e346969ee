Princess Charlene of Monaco, who recently celebrated her 45th birthday, attended the Ceremony Of The Sainte-Devote today. Saint Devote is the patron saint of Corsica and Monaco, and celebrations on their feast day remain fervent in the Principality of Monaco. The ceremony took place at St Nicholas Cathedral, however, Prince Albert II of Monaco could not attend due to testing positive for coronavirus. The Princess wore a grey blazer with two buttons on each side, however the blazer was connected with a little thread in the centre, as opposed to the buttons. Charlene paired this blazer with a grey turtleneck jumper underneath, and the colours blended into each other perfectly. Kate Middleton stepped out on Thursday wearing a pink turtleneck jumper accompanied by the same coloured coat.

Charlene then wore a brown knee-length skirt, which looked to be made out of a suede material. The skirt was also split at the front centre, adding a nice bit of dimension to the garment. Charlene then wore knee-length brown suede boots which again perfectly blended into her skirt.  To cope with the cold January weather in Monaco currently, the Princess wore some chocolate brown leather gloves to add some warmth.

However, royal watcher @silver_lining85 was not overly impressed with her style, saying: "Looks messy and uncoordinated." Whereas, @RamendraNathRay said the Princess looked "excellent". Princess Charlene was later joined on the Monaco palace balcony with her twin children, Prince Jacques and Princess Gabriella. She was also joined by her husband Prince Albert who was wearing a mask to protect his family from the coronavirus. Gabriella, eight, wore a beautifully tailored green blazer to match her mother. Both Charlene and Gabriella were continuing the family's reputation as regal fashion icons.
