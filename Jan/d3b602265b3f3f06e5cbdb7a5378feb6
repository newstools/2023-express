James Martin's Saturday Morning on ITV welcomed veteran chef Brian Turner to the show as he rustled up a "cheap and economical" lamb dish. Brian, 76, suffered a stroke last summer and although he has recovered well, he wanted to address his occasional stammer. After James introduced Brian to the show, he discussed the dish he was going to make. He said: "Neck end of lamb so it's economical, it's got lots of vegetables for the kids to eat. It's nutritious and as I say, it's cheap." Before they got started, James said Brian wanted to say a thank you to some heroes as he had "not been very well recently". Addressing the camera, Brian said: "Unfortunately I had a stroke in June last year and the people at the London hospital were fantastic.
