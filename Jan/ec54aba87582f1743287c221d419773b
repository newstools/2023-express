A 15-year-old school girl has been named as the victim of a stabbing in Hexham, Northumberland, on Friday. Holly Newton, also known as Holly Olivia, was a student at the local Queen Elizabeth School, and many friends have since voiced their anguish at the devastating news. Close relatives and friends have been seen leaving moving tributes and flowers at the scene of the stabbing in the quaint Northumberland town which is reeling from the tragedy.  Many were spotted in tears and embraced each other in front of the tributes left outside the Halifax bank on Priestpopple. One note, left by Holly's mother read: "To our baby Holly. Our hearts hurt so much right now. We love you so much. Love mam and Lee. See you soon beautiful." Another laid by Holly's grandmother read: "All ways loved never forgotten. Your never be out of our thoughts. All our love nana and granddad." [sic] A third tribute left at the scene read:  "All our love to the most beautiful girl in the world. We will miss you forever Holly."   A 16-year-old boy has today been charged with the murder of Holly. Hexham mayor Derek Kennedy said the town, which often tops lists of the 'happiest place to live' in the UK, was "in complete shock". He said: "To lose one of our children who attends a local high school is just horrendous. "To happen to such a young person and the alleged perpetrator to be a young person, in the high street at 5pm, is just shocking. "Everyone is struggling to come to terms with it It will ruin so many lives."
