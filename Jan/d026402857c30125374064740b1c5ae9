  After the drama had unfolded, in view of her 302,000 followers Carol penned: “BBC RADIO WALES Hoorayyyy. “Back on with my radio wifey @natsus1 from 1130-2pm.

(sic) The pictures showed the glamorous presenter modelling a white, preppy jumper with some tight, black leggings.  She added a thick black belt to the outfit to accentuate her tiny waist and famous curves. The post comes after her former friend Michelle hit out at Carol when the Mirror went for a comment about the Welsh star’s recent comments about her. Speaking to the publication, a source close to Michelle said: "Baroness Mone will not be commenting on this publicity-hungry person." Carol recently appeared to reignite the feud between the pair on This Morning - just months after their friendship reportedly ended. In a scathing attack, the former Countdown host made a number of claims about Michelle which she has since denied.  She said: "I cannot talk about useless PPE without also talking about Michelle Mone who was brought into the House of Lords, as a baroness, by David Cameron. "Now Michelle Mone, I knew many years ago and then dropped her like a stone as soon as I realised what kind of person she was," Carol continued, before staring into the camera and stating: "Sue me, Michelle." At that point, presenter Alison Hammond stepped in to mediate the situation, explaining that Michelle wasn't able to defend herself against the comments. Express.co.uk has contacted Michelle and Carol for comment.
