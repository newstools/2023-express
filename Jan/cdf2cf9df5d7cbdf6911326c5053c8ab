Now, a week on from the claim that Prince Harry killed 25 Taliban, some of his Sandhurst classmates have poked holes in his revelations. Speaking exclusively to the Mail, the classmates have said that, while a student, the 38-year-old was actually told the complete opposite. They claimed that Harry's presented representation of army teaching was "wrong by 180 degrees" and that they were in fact taught that 'othering' and dehumanising was completely wrong. Other officer cadets claimed that they, and Harry, were warned such cognitive biases were highly dangerous. Harry's claim of the "killings" happened on his second tour of Afghanistan. In his memoir, Harry wrote that "they" - his Army instructors - trained me to "other" them and they trained me well".
