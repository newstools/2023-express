The Australian Open is back underway on Thursday with plenty of action to look forward to at Melbourne Park. Both Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic are back on the show courts for their respective second-round matches later today. For Murray, his side of the draw has significantly opened up following Casper Ruud's shock defeat to Jenson Brooksby. Roberto Bautista Agut is now the only seeded player Murray could face before the quarter-final. Not since 2016, when the Brit reached the Australian Open final, has he managed to get past the fourth round of the major. Djokovic meanwhile takes on qualifier Enzo Couacaud for a place in the third-round, where he could face Grigor Dimitrov or compatriot Laslo Djere. Britain's Dan Evans continued his impressive form earlier in the day when he beat Jeremy Chardy in straight sets to set up a fascinating third-round tie against No 5 seed Andrey Rublev. There are no more Brits in the women's singles draw following Emma Raducanu's exit to Coco Gauff, but Ons Jabeur will be back on the court as she bids to win her first major.
