Cunard is celebrating 100 years of its onboard photographers with the Sea Views show. Snapper Mary McCartney, 53, is curating 100 images for the digital exhibition and wants to dip into the wealth of shots from non-famous cruise customers. Mary, who is the daughter of Sir Paul, said: "I'm looking forward to exploring the archives and the crowdsourced images to pick a portfolio of iconic images that will reflect a century of luxury travel." Cunard introduced onboard photographers at the same time it launched the world's first round-the-world cruise on the Laconia. Its archive of 14,000 shots is stored at the University of Liverpool Library - in the firm's home city. Cunard president Sture Myrmell said: "We're extremely proud of Cunard's 183-year history and particularly the fact we pioneered the round-the-world voyage 100 years ago. "What better way to celebrate this centenary than by curating a fantastic selection of images from our guests who've travelled with us. We're delighted to work with the wonderful Mary McCartney."
