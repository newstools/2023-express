Letters from King Edward VIII to a fan have emerged for sale detailing his bitterness at what he felt was unfair treatment following his abdication. The correspondence reveals how Edward, the then Duke of Windsor, believed the Royal Family and the media had tried to "humiliate and misrepresent" him and Wallis Simpson. King Edward VIII caused a constitutional crisis when he abdicated the throne in 1936 so he could marry American divorcee Wallis. The events caused a deep and long-lasting rift between Edward and his young brother and successor George VI, who had been the 'spare' to the heir. Edward and Wallis were later exiled to France, where they lived in a historic and luxurious villa in Paris. The Duke of Windsor vented his frustrations to avid fan Lillian Boraston in a series of letters sent as he travelled around the world in the months after his adbdicationMrs Boraston, who lived in Surrey, was a keen royal fan who regularly sent letters and poems to Edward. She kept all of her correspondence with the Duke safe in a box of family papers which has only recently been rediscovered. They are now being sold by a granddaughter at auction.The most insightful letter reveals the sense of betrayal which Edward felt after travelling to the US and before his controversial visit to Nazi Germany. Mrs Boraston sent the Duke a poem and her hopes that he was not missing home too much. In September 1937, his private secretary responded: "I am desired by the Duke of Windsor to acknowledge your letter of August 30th. "His Royal Highness thanks you for the poem and your kind wishes, but asks me at the same time to assure you that the information that His Royal Highness is homesick is entirely without foundation. "His Royal Highness wishes me to add that quite apart from rumours in the press, it is not very likely that he would be missing the country which in every possible way, tried to humiliate and misrepresent both himself and the Duchess of Windsor." Auctioneers said the parallels to Harry and Meghan's dramatic move to America are 'clear to see'.
