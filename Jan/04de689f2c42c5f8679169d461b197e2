Mark Wahlberg flaunted his musclebound torso as he toasted to the New Year in a video uploaded to social media. The 51-year-old actor took to Instagram to share a cheerful video with his 20.4 million followers, as he raised a glass of Flecha Azul tequila, the drink of a company he is an owner-partner of. In the video, the Hollywood star could be seen wearing a pair of light blue swimming trunks, a green baseball cap and a pair of dark sunglasses. The stunning background revealed a sun-soaked port in an exotic destination where the actor has been spending the last day of 2022. Mark captioned the post: “Happy new year!! 2023 let’s go!! @flechaazultequila #FlechaAzulPartner." (sic)
