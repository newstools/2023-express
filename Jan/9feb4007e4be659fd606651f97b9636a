First Group said it would study how passengers, drivers, other road users and pedestrians respond to two autonomous buses at a ­business and technology park in Oxfordshire. A minibus providing a ­circular service for people around Milton Park near Didcot was demonstrated yesterday and is due to begin public operations early next month. A full-size single decker will be added later this year. It will run between the business park and Didcot Parkway railway station. First Group head of policy John Birtwistle says it is “only a matter of time” before electric buses are used across the UK, but “the autonomous side of things is more about exploring the art of the possible”. He added: “The technology is spreading to different forms of transport, including buses and coaches. “We need to explore how it works, how accepted it is by the public, how drivers react to it and how people who aren’t using the services react to it.” Mr Birtwistle said that “rigorous” testing has taken place to ensure the vehicles are “absolutely” safe. The buses are “capable of coping with all the different experiences you would have from day to day”. He added: “They can deal with traffic signals. They can deal with roundabouts. They can deal with parked vehicles. They can make all the turning manoeuvres and simple braking and acceleration.” Despite the vehicles being fitted with autonomous tech, a driver will be behind the wheel to provide assistance to passengers and take ­control if needed.
