Following his separation and eventual divorce from Priscilla Presley in 1972, Elvis Presley began dating 22-year-old Linda Thompson. The Miss Tennessee model moved into Graceland and lived with The King for four years. During this period the star’s only child Lisa Marie Presley would stay with her mother Priscilla in Los Angeles, but during the holidays would venture out to Memphis to live with her father and his girlfriend. Following Lisa’s untimely death at 54 on Thursday, Linda has shared her devastation on Instagram. After news of Lisa Marie suffering a cardiac arrest and being admitted to hospital, Linda posted a string of beautiful pictures of her with Elvis and his daughter from back in the mid-1970s. There’s even a sweet one of her opening her Christmas presents with The King at Graceland.  Tragically the 54-year-old died last night, as announced by her mother Priscilla and Elvis’ former girlfriend has responded with another post.
