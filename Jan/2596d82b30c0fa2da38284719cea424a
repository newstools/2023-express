Climbers have slammed Mount Snowdon, saying it smells of urine and has views of "ugly rocks". Yr Wyddfa, better known by its English name, Snowdon, is thought to be the busiest mountain in the UK, with around 500,000 people reaching its summit each year.   While the majority of hikers enjoy their experience and the breathtaking views, some people are less than impressed. On Tripadvisor, Wales' highest mountain has a five-star rating, with around 98 per cent of users rating Yr Wyddfa as either "excellent" or "very good". There has been some negative feedback, however, with 21 people leaving a "terrible" rating as well as some often puzzling reviews. From complaints about the smell, the lack of toilets, and even how "exhausting" the ascent is, not everyone has positive memories of their visit, reports North Wales Live.  New York-based Tripadvisor user Adhsz W complained: "There are no lavatories for all those who climb up and trek back. "People seem to relieve themselves out in the open giving a whiff of urine smell everywhere in this hillside." Richard A said: "Every rock you go behind smells of wee or has human excrement behind it, I walked behind a building at the top to find some poor woman taking a dump. "Lots of visitors here so itâ€™s building up into a veritable sewage fest." One review was especially puzzling given the fact that the person in question was seemingly aware they were going up a mountain. Kizaaa said: "I did the Pyg track there and back and found the ascent horrific - so exhausting. "Rubbish views of ugly rocks and a couple lakes sometimes, would never do it again." Visitors complaining about the lack of toilet facilities will be delighted to hear that Hafod Eryri, the cafe at the summit of Yr Wyddfa, will soon be reopening for the first time since 2019. The building will re-open its doors on May 13.
