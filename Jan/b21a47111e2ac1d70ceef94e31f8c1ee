Working as part of a small group in a Parisian attic, the French Resistance fighter once helped to produce birth and baptism certificates and ration cards for 300 Jewish children marked for imminent German capture. Kaminsky refused to sleep until every one of the 900 documents were ready, calculating that one hour’s sleep would cost 30 children their lives. The son of Russian émigrés of Jewish descent born in Buenos Aires, he was raised in Paris and then Normandy. Kaminsky was an apprentice clothes dyer and learned how to remove stains, gleaning chemical knowledge from textbooks. He joined the Resistance, aged 17, gaining his forger’s job because of his chemistry and dyes knowledge. His skill was unrivalled and he used dust and pencil lead to age the paper, along with convincing watermarks. Sometimes the job involved carrying these forged ID cards to the homes of Jews about to be arrested by the Nazis. Between 1946 and 1948 he created identity papers for Jews working for Haganah, the Zionist organisation then operating in British Mandatory Palestine. In later life, Kaminsky was awarded the Combatant’s Cross and The Medal of the City of Paris for his heroic efforts. He is survived by his wife, their three children and a daughter from an earlier marriage. His son by his first marriage predeceased him.
