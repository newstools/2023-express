Madonna, 64, has shocked fans as she took to Instagram to share a video of herself snogging actor Jack Black, while also challenging Amy Schumer to an X-rated dare. The Like a Virgin star also had singer Diplo flash guests after being told to "show his d**k". Madonna deleted all her posts on Instagram, to then dedicate the social media site to her 40th-anniversary world tour. She shared the raunchy video in view of her 18.7 million Instagram followers, using it to confirm her 35 city gigs. Madonna also shared an extended five-minute video on YouTube, showing the full extent of the A-listers wild dinner party. It featured other notable names such as Lil Wayne, Judd Apatow, Bob The Drag Queen, Kate Berlant, Larry Owens, Meg Stalter, and Eric Andre.
