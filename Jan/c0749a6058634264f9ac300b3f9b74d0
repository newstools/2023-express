Boris Becker has made a long-awaited return to TV just a month after being released from prison. Becker is one of the most recognisable faces in tennis, having won six Grand Slam titles - including three at Wimbledon - in an incredible playing career on the court. Off it, the German star remained in the professional game, having been an active face on the television screens of tennis fans across the world. Most notably, Becker featured regularly on the BBC’s coverage of Wimbledon as a studio and court-side pundit. In 2022 though, the six-time Grand Slam champion was absent from the BBC’s coverage of the annual event after being sentenced to two-and-a-half-years in prison two months before the event kicked off. Nine months on from his sentencing though, Becker is back.
