Speaking in Belfast on Friday Sir Keir encouraged Mr Sunak to resolve the long-running dispute over the Northern Ireland Protocol, which avoids a hard border with Ireland. He said at Queen’s University: “The time for action on the protocol is now. The time to stand up to the ERG is now. The time to put Northern Ireland above a Brexit purity cult, which can never be satisfied - is now.” READ MORE: Brexiteers slam Khan for trying to drag UK back into EU single market Sir Keir explained there is a “small window of opportunity” to resolve the Protocol ahead of the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday agreement in April: “We’ve got to use the anniversary to fix minds, get the country and its political process moving forward again – deliver for the people of Northern Ireland.” He said he would offer “political cover” at Westminster in order for an agreement with the European Union that is in the national interest.
