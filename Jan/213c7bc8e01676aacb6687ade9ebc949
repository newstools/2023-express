Conor McGregor has denied attacking a woman on a yacht after he was accused of doing so in Ibiza last summer. An unnamed Irish woman alleges that she attended a party on the former UFC champion’s yacht near Ibiza last summer to celebrate his birthday. According to the Spanish newspaper Ultima Hora, the alleged victim claims that McGregor punched her and threatened to drown her on his boat back in July. The publication reports that the case will now go before the investigating court in Ibiza. The alleged incident is not being investigated in the Irishman’s home nation at this time because the woman initially told police that she was assaulted by another man and so will instead be looked into by Ibiza authorities, per Ultima Hora. Karen Kessler, a spokesperson for McGregor stated: "Mr. McGregor is steadfast in his denial of all the accusations made by a guest on his boat.” After celebrating his birthday at an Ibiza club - a party the alleged victim said she attended - the woman in question also claims that she was invited back onto the MMA star's yacht. The next morning, the woman alleged that McGregor got aggressive and violent towards her out of nowhere, punching her in the stomach and chin, lunging at her and threatening to drown her. The woman escaped by jumping into the water, per Ultima Hora. An Ibiza judge will reportedly take statements from the woman and witnesses and then make a decision on whether McGregor will be cited for a felony. McGregor has not been charged with any crime at the time of writing. MORE UFC NEWS...
