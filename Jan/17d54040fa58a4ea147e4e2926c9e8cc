Yesterday, Lisa Marie Presley’s funeral took place at her father Elvis Presley’s mansion. Just two weeks before, she had stood on the same front lawn to celebrate what would have been The King’s 88th birthday. Following the 54-year-old’s sudden death, she has been buried in Graceland’s Meditation Garden near Elvis and next to her son Benjamin Keough, who died at just 27 in 2020. Alongside immediate family members, a couple of The King’s former girlfriends who helped raise Lisa Marie have been paying tribute including Linda Thompson. The former Miss Tennessee model Linda Thompson lived with Elvis at Graceland from 1972-6. The King had divorced his wife Priscilla Presley who lived in Los Angeles with Lisa Marie. However, she’d go to Memphis during her school holidays to stay with her father, until he died in 1977 when she was just nine. Linda, who claims she saved Elvis’ life on a number of occasions, wasn’t included in Baz Luhrmann’s biopic of the singer apart from a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it moment of archive footage skimming over the last few years of his life. Nevertheless, The King’s old flame continues to honour his legacy on her Instagram account to this day, regularly sharing photos together. And more recently the 72-year-old has posted snaps of herself with Elvis and Lisa Marie after her sudden death.  In another post, she asked fans to keep Elvis’ three granddaughters and Priscilla in their prayers during such a painful time.
