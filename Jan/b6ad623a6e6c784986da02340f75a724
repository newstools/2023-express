The solemn procession took place at the Vila Belmiro Stadium, home of his beloved long-time club Santos. Pele’s coffin was placed on the pitch where he played for 18 years. Mourners filed past to say a final farewell to their national hero. Vila Belmiro, a 16,000-seat ground located near Sao Paulo, was decorated with Brazilian flags and No10 shirts like those worn by the star, widely regarded as the world’s greatest-ever footballer. As its stands filled with bouquets of flowers placed by fans and sent in by clubs from across the world, loudspeakers played a song named Eu Sou Pele (I Am Pele) that was recorded by the Brazilian himself. His funeral will start at 10am local time today, with the burial taking place in a cemetery just 600 metres from his old home ground. Brazil’s new president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, is expected to attend. Among the many mourners yesterday was Fifa president Gianni Infantino, who spoke with Pele’s widow, Marcia Aoki. He said: “I am here with a lot of emotion, sadness, but also with a smile because he gave us so many smiles. “At Fifa, we will pay a tribute to the king and we ask the whole world to observe a minute of silence.” Pele’s mother, 100-year-old Dona Celeste, who is suffering from ill health, felt strong enough to attend. Helped by relatives she walked on to the Santos pitch to pay her respects to Pele. His son Edinho was seen praying with others during the day. Santos fan Rodrigo Belem, 63, said: “It’s a funeral, but also it’s a carnival. We are here to celebrate the life of the greatest player to grace a football field.” Rubbish collector Saulo Duarte said: “Pele was Brazil’s greatest player and I wanted to be here to pay tribute to him.” Pele – the only man to win the World Cup three times as a player – died on Thursday after a cancer battle. He was 82.
