Manchester United are having a quiet window so far with only Wout Weghorst arriving on loan from Burnely. However, with an unlikely title tilt now on the horizon following a stunning comeback victory over neighbours Man City, Erik ten Hag might just be given some extra funds to mount a challenge. Even with little movement this month, United are still working hard behind the scenes drawing up a shortlist of players to go after in the next six months. Harry Kane and Victor Osimhen have been mentioned as blockbuster targets but Ten Hag also wants to conquer the Dutch market and snap up some of the younger players in the region. According to reports, he has told scouts to keep an eye on over a dozen young Dutch players with Jurrien Timber and four others of particular interest to Ten Hag. Youth may be the way forward for United as it's also emerged they have been taking 'discreet' scouting trips to check in onÂ Real Betis youngster Luiz Henrique. United owners the Glazers are reluctant to spend big in January but loans and bargain deals are still a credible option. Marcus Thuram, whose deal runs out in the summer, is one the club could target this month with Chelsea also eyeing him up and Borussia Monchengladbach open to cashing in on him.
