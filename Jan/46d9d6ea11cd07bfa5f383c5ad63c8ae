 Prime Minister Rishi Sunak sacked his Party Chairman Nadhim Zahawi on Sunday, declaring that his tax affairs were “a very serious breach of the ministerial code”. But who do you think should be appointed as the new Conservative chair? Vote in our poll.  Speculation about Mr Zahawi’s replacement is growing, with Jacob Rees-Mogg suggesting former Prime Minister Boris Johnson as the next Conservative Chairman. He said Mr Johnson had “all the qualities” to take on the frontbench role. He told Camilla Tominey on her GB News politics programme that it had been a “mistake to remove” him in September. He explained: “He has all the right attributes for a party chairman… He is charismatic, he rallies the troops. He's a sort of fully loaded-Conservative. So I think that type of personality would be a very good one for a party chairman.” READ MORE: Boris tipped to replace Zahawi as Tory party chairman Previous Conservative Chairmen Brandon Lewis and Oliver Dowden have also been suggested as potential candidates. One MP told The Telegraph: “I don’t think it’s time to give someone a first shot. It should be someone who has already done the job, simply because of the seriousness of the job at hand with an election round the corner.” Other potential replacements for Mr Zahawi include former Home Secretary Priti Patel, Foreign Office Minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan, junior Trade Minister Andrew Bowie, Mr Sunak’s election agent in 2015 and 2017 and Deputy Chairman Matt Vickers, former Assistant Government Whip Stuart Andrew, Prisons Minister Damian Hinds, former Deputy Chairman under Mr Johnson Paul Scully, Mr Suank’s Parliamentary Private Secretary Craig Williams, ‘Blue Wall’ Tory Lucy Frazer and ally Greg Hands.
