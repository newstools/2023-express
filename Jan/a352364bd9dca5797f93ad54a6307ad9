The United States has expressed doubts about whether Kyiv has the ability to drive out Russian troops from its territory this year. Hopes Ukraine will launch a massive spring offensive to reclaim occupied territory seized by Moscow were dealt a major blow on Friday after Western leaders refused to commit to providing Ukraine's army with much-needed tanks. At a security meeting held in Germany to discuss the Ukraine war, US General Mark Milley said it would be "very, very difficult" to eject Putin''s army from "every inch of Russian-occupied Ukraine". His comments come as Ukraine's military confirmed its forces had wiped out a Wagner ammunition dump and headquarters in Soledar in the hotly contested Donbas. The 45th Separate Artillery Brigade released a video showing the strike and its aftermath. A spokesperson for Ukraine's military said: "The headquarters and field warehouse of the Wagner mercenaries in Soledar were destroyed." FOLLOW THE LATEST UPDATES BELOW...
