Oodie became popular last year as Brits looked to find alternative heating sources to prevent increasing heating bills. While the Australian brand has expensive prices, Aldi has a similar dupe that’s far cheaper. Aldi’s Specialbuys include a wide range of clothing and one item in particular has been catching the eye of shoppers. The retailer has launched a dupe of the Oodie hooded blanket and the Avenue Kid’s Grey Hooded Blanket is on sale for 25 percent off. Slashed down to £14.99 from £19.99, it’s a whopping £62 cheaper than Oodie and has over 70 glowing five star reviews from shoppers. Snuggly, warm and a great cheap alternative to staying warm in winter, it’s a great investment at less than £20. The hooded blanket is an oversized hoodie made from super soft fleece to keep you warm and snug. It’s complete with a kangaroo pocket and its extra-wide size guarantees that it provides full-body warmth to little ones. Ideal for little ones to wear around the house, Aldi is also selling a baby version for £6.99, and a Do Not Disturb blanket and eye mask for only £5.99. Don’t hesitate to buy the hoodie as it sells out fast. Aldi shoppers have praised the hoodie for helping keep children warm and being great value for money. RjcM said: “It is very warm and great to keep heating off.” Jools agreed: “I bought this for two young boys who were feeling extremely cold this winter. The perfect answer!” CerenW added: “They are so soft and warm. They are really well made and an absolute bargain compared to other makes."
