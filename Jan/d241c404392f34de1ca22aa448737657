Chinese New Year begins on Sunday 22 January and according to the Chinese zodiac, 2023 is known as the Year of the Rabbit. Last year was the Year of the Tiger and next year will be the Year of the Dragon - each year is a different animal based on a 12-year cycle. So which animal are you and what does it mean? The animals chosen are based on a Chinese legend known as the Great Race which was hosted by a Chinese Emperor. He had all the animals race against one another, and the fasted 12 were announced as the winners, each having a year named after it. In order, these animals are Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Pig. Since then, Chinese astrology states the year you are born is represented by an animal. The Chinese zodiac ascribes animals with positive and negative attributes each year, and Chinese people believe a person’s horoscope, personality, love and compatibility are close associate with his/her zodiac sign. Note: The Chinese zodiac year usually starts from Chinese New Year, which ranges from late January to mid-February. Therefore, if you were born in January or February in one of the years below, you might be the animal before or after. Eg. if you were born on January 25, 1995, you are not a Pig, you are a Dog as the Year of the Pig began on January 30, 1995.
