Large smoke fumes have been spotted in East London after what appears to be a large fire on a residential street in Hackney. Video footage taken at the scene of the incident shows a bus on fire on Wilton Way close to London Fields. According to reports, the 30-seater school bus had children inside at the time of the fire. Hackney council said in a statement earlier today: "This morning a fire broke out on a school bus in Hackney. The cause of the fire is yet to be determined.  Early videos of the site show plumes of smoke rising across East London as dark fire rises from the residential street. Another person shared: "Huge fire on Wilton Way in London fields - looks like a van." It has since been confirmed the vehicle was in fact a bus, not a van. Alongside the bus, six other vehicles were damaged in the blaze. Firefighters tackled the flames on Wilton Way in Hackney with 999 receiving 42 calls over the incident. "Thankfully, there have been no reports of injuries," the London Fire Brigade said in a statement on social media. Firefighters worked to bring the blaze under control after the first calls were made at 8.13am this morning. Residents said that the road had been closed as firefighters fought to control the smoke. Footage of the incident showed a large plume of smoke rising above the houses. In a statement, LFB said: "Firefighters tackled a bus fire on Wilton Way in Hackney this morning (January 20).
