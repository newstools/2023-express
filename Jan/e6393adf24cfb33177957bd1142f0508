Miami Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra appeared to offer support to experienced veteran Dawayne Dedmon after the NBA star threw a massage gun onto the court during the middle of a game. Dedmon was ejected from the game after throwing a tantrum curtsied. Dedmon was seen having heated words with Spoelstra during the middle of the game while the Heat were moving the ball down the field. The vet had just been taken out of the game and appeared to have taken the decision personally. In the video, Dedmon can be seen on the side of the court having some heated words with the head coach, before losing his temper in the worst way possible. The 33-year-old picked up a massage gun and launched it down the court. Luckily, the appliance didn't hit anyone, instead it flew through the middle of the action on the court and landed just by the three-point line. Play was immediately stopped, and players from both teams could be seen turning and looking at the Heat bench in frustrated confusion. Speaking afterwards, Spoelstra appeared to offer support to Dedmon, suggesting he wanted his players to show a bit of attitude. He said: "We’re all a bunch of gnarly personalities. "That part was unfortunate. Everything before that, that’s the Miami Heat. That part was unacceptable.” Dedmon was ejected from the game, and stropped his way back to the locker room while his team went on to secure a 112-111 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder.
