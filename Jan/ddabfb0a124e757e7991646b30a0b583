Three people, including a grandmother and a four-year-old boy, made a miraculous escape after their Tesla plunged through a wall and into a home swimming pool. Pictures show the sports car submerged in water after the horror crash, believed to have been caused by the driver hitting the accelerator instead of the brake. Two eyewitnesses from a nearby pre-school responded quickly, jumping into the pool to rescue the family. The terrifying events unfolded at around 9am on Tuesday in the Pasadena suburb of California. None of the occupants suffered injuries. In a post on Twitter, the Pasadena Fire Department said: “PFD and PPD are on scene [at] 700 block, West California Boulevard.    “A Tesla driver hit the accelerator instead of the brake, drove through a wall and into a pool. “Three occupants in the vehicle including a child. “Good samaritans jumped into the pool and rescued the occupants.” Lisa Derderian, a spokesperson for the City of Pasadena, later confirmed two staff members from the nearby Pacific Oaks Children's School came to their rescue after witnessing the crash.
