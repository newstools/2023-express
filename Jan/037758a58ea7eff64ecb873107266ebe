One disguise used on this year's The Masked Singer is Jellyfish, who has kept the ITV judging panel on their toes with several different clues. Some fans insist they have Jellyfish sussed though, with a few taking to social media to take a stab at who the famous face behind the mask could be. One name popping up in a lot of predictions was Britain's Got Talent judge Alesha Dixon. Jellyfish entertained fans of the show on Saturday with their performance of Leave a Light On by Tom Walker. In her clue trailer on Saturday, Jellyfish commented: "Such a pleasure. "Now, I am never one to fish for a compliment, but I'm certainly one to give them. "Sure, I might critique, but I'll always do it from a place of love."

"Although a decision was made in my career that saw me removed from the spotlight - now that's just not on. "Tonight I'll be stinging one of my favourite songs!" Jellyfish went on to wow audiences with her song choice, which this week was another clue. Making their guesses, the judges were divided as to who Jellyfish might be. Rita Ora was adamant she knew who it was, guessing: "Could it be somebody who also has a song called Spotlight, Jennifer Hudson?" Mo Gilligan made the connection between judging and a clue reminding him of Avatar and guessed Leona Lewis. Like the viewers, Davina McCall predicted Alesha Dixon, but Jonathan Ross went with Amber Riley. DON'T MISS...
