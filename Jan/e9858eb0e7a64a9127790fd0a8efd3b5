The boss of green energy firm Ecotricity believes raising taxes paid by wealthy people could help provide much-needed revenue. Dale, 61, a member of campaign group Patriotic Millionaires UK, said “ordinary people are facing a repeated series of economic body blows” but no political leaders are “taking it seriously enough”. He added: “How are we supposed to tackle the cost-of-living crisis, our unravelling public services and infrastructure or climate breakdown if we can’t even talk about how we make the tax system fairer, specifically how we tax the very richest among us?” Millionaires from 13 countries have signed the letter urging global leaders to tax the ultra-rich more. It says people are now “living in an age of extremes” that has resulted in billions struggling “to earn a liveable wage”. It comes as the latest figures suggest the wealthiest one per cent of the world’s population amassed twice as much wealth in the last two years than the rest of the world put together. Mr Vince who is backing the Daily Express Green Britain Needs You campaign added: “If we want to get our country back on track then we have to invest in it. “What better way to pay for that investment than through taxing the ultra-rich?”
