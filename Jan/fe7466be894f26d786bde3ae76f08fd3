Over the past three years 27 forces in England and Wales splashed out on rainbow-coloured whistles, key rings, shoelaces, pens and lip balm. Police chiefs have been accused of “wasting money on woke nonsense”. Figures released under freedom of information laws showed £66,689 was spent between 2019 and 2022. The highest spender was South Wales Police, which racked up £24,000 on rainbow flags, face paints, T-shirts, badges, pens, whistles, ­wristbands, trolley keyrings and water bottles. Second was Kent Police, which forked out £8,000 on rainbow whistles, key rings, wristbands, pens, pencils, erasers, stickers, coasters, lanyards, trolley coins and ID holders. Essex Police spent £7,700 on ­rainbow merchandise while LGBT-branded handheld fans were included in Avon and Somerset’s £4,900 ­rainbow merchandise bill. Staffordshire Police blew £3,300 on shoelaces, balloons, and lanyards. Greater Manchester Police spent £2,900 including on rainbow epaulettes. The investigation by the Taxpayers’ Alliance, also found hundreds of pounds being spent on decorating police cars in rainbow livery. Yet only 5.4 percent of all crimes resulted in a charge in the year to June, which is a third of the charging rate seven years ago, Home Office figures said. Overall recorded crime stands at 6.5 million offences, up seven percent since the pandemic. Tom Ryan, of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: “Police chiefs have been caught red-handed wasting money on woke nonsense. “Forces should stop this pointless spending and focus funds on the front line.” But Chief Superintendent Amanda Tillotson, of Kent Police, said its LGBT+ crime-prevention merchandise reminds the public of the importance of communities “working together to support and protect each other”.
