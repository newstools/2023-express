Madonna, 64, looked fabulously stylish in a head-to-toe Gucci outfit as she visited Raising Malawi, the charity she founded in 2006. The Queen of Pop took the opportunity during the trip to shoot a video for the remake of her 2015 song Back That Up To The Beat. Madonna donned a green hoodie with camouflage trousers and suede boots, finishing off the look with an oversized bucket hat featuring Gucciâ€™s monogram. The Material Girl singer completed the casual look with a phone case that was attached to a Gucci strap. The mum-of-six was joined by her children, who could be seen in the clip playing football and dancing with the locals. Madonna adopted four children who were born in Malawi - twins Stella and Estere, 10, Mercy James, 16, and David, 17, who joined her on the trip along with her son Rocco, 22, who she shares with ex-husband Guy Ritchie.
