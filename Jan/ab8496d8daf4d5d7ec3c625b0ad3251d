But here we are in January 2023; the Covid crisis has passed; vaccinations may not wipe out the virus but will certainly save most from severe illness. Yet health hysteria is worse than ever. It's as if we've recovered from the disease but it's left the NHS for dead, running around like a headless chicken without a brain cell. When I was at school the girls divided into maths nerds and bookish English-lit types like me and my mates. We thought we were the bees' knees, pretentiously quoting Hamlet at parties. Now I'd give anything to understand science, so I applaud Rishi Sunak's idea of compulsory mathematics. It won't work though. It's genetic. My kids are as useless as me.
