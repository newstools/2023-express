There are just over two weeks remaining in the January transfer window andÂ Premier League spending does not show any signs of slowing down just yet. Manchester United have already landed goalkeeper Jack Butland and striker Wout Weghorst, but fans will be desperately hoping for at least one or two more new faces before the window slams shut. Arsenal, meanwhile, missed out on Mykhalo Mudryk to Chelsea, but are now being linked with a whole host of other players, such as Declan Rice, Moussa Diaby and Facundo Torres. Will we see any movement from the Gunners today? Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp has made it clear that the club are not in a position to spend much more big money this month, having already splashed out on Netherlands forward Cody Gakpo. But given the Reds' dire recent form, it remains to be seen if their owners FSG make any more transfer funds available in a bid to turn the tide. And with the likes of Tottenham, Newcastle and Leeds also threatening to spend before the end of the month, we could well be in for more twists and turns.
