A woman who sexually assaulted and strangled another female in a horrendous attack at her home has been jailed for five years. Chelsea O’Neill, 21, of no fixed address, was sentenced to five years' imprisonment at Wood Green Crown Court on Friday, January 27. O’Neill was found guilty, after a three-week trial of sexual assault by penetration; sexual assault by touching and actual bodily harm. The court was told O’Neill visited the victim, who was known to her, in Tottenham, in the early hours of the morning on October 13, 2021. She proceeded to strangle her victim and sexually assault her, and the girl reported the incident to police the next day, with officers launching an investigation. O'Neill remained in custody before being charged, on October 15, 2021 with sexual assault by penetration. Detective Sergeant Myles Bossman, who led the investigation, said: “O’Neill is a highly dangerous individual. "She subjected a young female to significant violence without any remorse for her actions. "The sentencing is welcomed as it displays a clear message that such acts will not be tolerated. He added: "This was a horrific ordeal for the girl, but she, with the support of her family, has shown immense strength and courage in coming forward and supporting a police investigation." "I would like to thank the brave victim for her strength, I hope the conviction goes some way to providing closure after what must have been a horrific ordeal. “The Met encourages anyone who is victim or witness to sexual assault, to contact police, there is zero tolerance for such serious offences."
