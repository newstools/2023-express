Manchester United recorded their 11th Premier League win of the season on Tuesday night as they overcame Bournemouth 3-0 at Old Trafford. The Red Devils are now fourth in the Premier League table following an upturn in fortunes under Erik ten Hag and will be looking to secure their place back in the Champions League come the end of the season. United are finally starting to make progress on the pitch following years of underperformance. And Ten Hag will be confident of guiding his side to success between now and May. But the Dutchman will be keen to bolster his team during the winter transfer window to ensure he has a squad that can compete with the best teams in the Premier League. Ten Hag lost Cristiano Ronaldo in November and will want to replace him as soon as possible to ensure his side donâ€™t struggle in front of goal. The likes of Memphis Depay and Randal Kolo Muani have both been tipped to move to Old Trafford. And Express Sport will have all the latest United transfer news and gossip. So stick around throughout the day.
