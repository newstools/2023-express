The 2016 Olympic silver medallist's wife Peta, 36, tried to shield their three-year-old son as the masked thieves smashed their way into the couple's home, Chelmsford Crown Court heard. Romario Henry, 31, of Lewisham, south-east London, and Oludewa Okorosobo, 28, of Camberwell, south London, deny robbery at the Cavendish home in Ongar, Essex, on November 27, 2021. Edward Renvoize, prosecuting, said Mr Cavendish, 37, tried to trigger a bedroom panic alarm during the night-time raid but the robbers leapt on him and began punching him. He added: "One produced a knife and threatened to stab him in front of his children." Mr Renvoize said during the ordeal, Mrs Cavendish tried to hide their son under the duvet before having her phone grabbed as she tried to dial 999. The raiders made off with the couple's Richard Mille watches, worth a total of Â£700,000, mobile phones and a Louis Vuitton suitcase, the court heard. However, in an "error in what was a carefully planned and executed robbery", police later found Mrs Cavendish's phone outside the house, Mr Renvoize said. A DNA sample was traced to Ali Sesay, 28, of Rainham, east London, who the lawyer said had "pleaded guilty to the offence of robbery already". Mr Renvoize said police then identified "a number of other individuals who appeared to have been in communication with a telephone belonging to Mr Sesay". The trial continues.
