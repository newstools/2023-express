Maya Jama was announced as the new presenter for the latest series of Love Island back in October after her predecessor Laura Whitmore stood down from her post. The seasoned broadcaster is known for her extensive TV and radio work, which includes BBC One’s Peter Crouch: Save Our Summer, as well as her impeccable fashion sense on the red carpet. Maya stunned fans back in November as she put on a very daring display in a risqué floor-length dress at the European Premiere of the Marvel film Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. The presenter made a show-stopping appearance at Cineworld in Leicester Square, London, wearing the orange and white gown, which featured a plunging V-neckline that stopped above her belly button. Prior to that, Maya looked fabulous in a cut-out gown as she attended last year's BRIT Awards 2022 at The O2 Arena. The DJ looked phenomenal in a two-piece set featuring a geometrical crop top and a black skirt that put her toned stomach on full display. Maya also put on an eye-popping display while attending The Prince’s Trust Gala in New York last year in a gorgeous ombre gown. The dress boasted a cleavage-baring cut-out while she accessorised with two large rings, including an alleged engagement ring from former boyfriend NBA player fiance Ben Simmons. Maya showed off her fabulous curves as she slipped into a corset while appearing at the star-studded NTAs back in 2021. The skirt of Maya's dress featured a split that went right up to the star's hip and put her toned legs on display, as well as her black platform sandals.
