The artworks, dating back 170 years, were found among heirlooms by antiques experts who were asked to value items at a property in Surrey. The vibrant paintings are said to show the artistic and colourful side of a woman who was famed for wearing mournful black for decades following Prince Albert's death. Both large oil paintings depict vases of flowers with letters of provenance on the reverse. The pictures are expected to fetch Â£10,000 each at Hansons Auctioneers in London on January 28. The anonymous seller said the paintings were bought by his grandfather. He said: "They deserve to come out of the shadows to be seen and enjoyed by others."
