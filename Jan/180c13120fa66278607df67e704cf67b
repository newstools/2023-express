Russian air defence systems have scrambled to protect the city of Belgorod 25 miles north of the Ukrainian border as locals reported more than 30 explosions in the early hours of Tuesday. The attack is the latest in a series of unclaimed explosions in Russian territory. Regional Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov reported via Telegram that explosions had been heard across the city and that there was “damage to power lines”.
