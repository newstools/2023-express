A school has been evacuated to allow a bomb squad to investigate nearby "suspicious items". Ellowes Hall Sports College in Dudley was closed as bomb disposal experts examine the items, which were found near the school.  Parents were told via text to keep their kids at home during the urgent inspection. The items were found on land near Old Quarry Drive in Upper Gornal at around 10pm, January 3, and were then taken to the playing fields. The school was not connected to the discovery but decided to remain closed as investigations continued, police said. They had instead been called by a member of the public to the suspicious items. Some parents have taken to social media to express their concern at the news. One person said: "Worrying text from Ellowes, takes a lot to close a school." The school said they are still waiting for further information from police. Traffic is being diverted from the area. An army official has been spotted at the scene, while a lone police officer keeps watch, reports Birmingham Live.
