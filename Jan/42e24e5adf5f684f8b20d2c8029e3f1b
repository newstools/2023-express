A McDonald's fan has revealed how you can get more food for less money with an ordering loophole. TikToker Ashley Osbourne told his followers how to get eight chicken nuggets for the price of six at the fast food giant.  The video has since amassed more than six million views on the social media platform, reports Manchester Evening News. Ordering on one of the in-store touch screens, Ashley said: "Another McDonald’s hack you all need to know about. "A large six chicken nugget meal is £6, but if you get two chicken nugget happy meals you’ll get two drinks, two fries and eight nuggets for cheaper." On the screen, it displayed the price of the large chicken nugget meal to be £6.09, compared to the cost of two happy meals, which would come in at £5.98, a total saving of 11p per order and essentially making two of the chicken nuggets completely free. People rushed to the comments to share their thoughts on the hack, with one pointing out that you also get the added benefit of two toys with the happy meals. Another added: "Literally been doing this for years," while a third commented: "Wow move aside Martin Lewis."    Some people were not so keen on the idea, with one saying: “Yeah, but at what cost? I’m not sitting in public with two happy meals.” Others even shared their own McDonald’s money saving hacks, as a mum said: "I have three children. Rather than getting three happy meals costing £10.47, I get 20 chicken nuggets, a small coke and large chips for £7.07." It is worth mentioning, though, that prices do vary across McDonald’s branches based on location and whether they are a franchise.
