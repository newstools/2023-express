Prince Harry "seems to want revenge", a royal commentator said after reading the Duke of Sussex's memoir. Explaining he thought releasing the 416-page memoir titled Spare was "a bad idea", royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams said upon appearing on RNZ's podcast Nights with Karyn Hay: "So you wonder, launching a memoir was always, I thought, a bad idea. Even the Duke of Windsor, 15 years after the abdication, he published the King's Story, but this was a completely different era and the book, although it caused some controversy, was nothing like this... these are direct, fierce, vengeful attacks on the Royal Family. "He seems to want revenge. Also, the word 'spare', overshadowed by his brother, the heir and the spare, was always bitter, but I don't think anyone thought the book could be quite as vengeful and angry as it is." Mr Fitzwilliams also wondered what the "long-term goal" of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex is after they have launched a series of criticism and claims against the Royal Family between December and early January. This comes as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex published a 24-page report of their Archewell Foundation. Launched in late 2020, the Foundation is the non-profit arm of Meghan and Harry, via which they carry out charitable work as well as support and promote initiatives focused on veterans, mental health and communities. Among the work done by Archewell between 2020 and 2022, the report highlighted the 12.66 million COVID-19 vaccines produced in partnership with Global Citizen for people around the world and the 50,000 meals served to those in need via the collaboration with the World Central Kitchen.
