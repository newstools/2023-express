Princess Anne’s husband, Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence, regularly joins the Princess Royal on her many engagements and official duties. However, he is recognised in the Court Circular — the official record of past royal engagements — as “accompanied” rather than a working royal in his own right. So do you think he should be recognised as one? Vote in our poll. Anne’s first husband Captain Mark Phillips turned down a royal title to ensure their children – Peter and Zara – would not be granted HRH titles. Similarly, when Anne and Sir Timothy married in 1992 he was not given a title. Royal commentator and editor of royalcentral.co.uk, Charlie Proctor, has claimed that King Charles III should properly recognise Sir Timothy as a working royal. He wrote: “The Monarchy needs working royals to fill the gaps left by the Sussexes and the Duke of York, and to assist the royals who are now of an advancing age.” READ MORE: Harry undermines Anne's work as he slams 'rigged' hardest-working list He added that the change would not impact the royal calendar as he could still accompany Anne but be recognised for his appearances in the Court Circular. Additionally, Sir Timothy would be able to conduct more charitable work independently. Mr Proctor noted that he enjoys property and regeneration and was previously chairman of the English Heritage Trust and vice chairman of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. He said: “These are areas in which the 67-year-old is already a great asset to the Royal Family, however, just imagine how much more could be done if he could carry out royal duties on their behalf.” So what do YOU think? Should he be recognised as a working royal? Vote in our poll and leave your thoughts in the comment section below.
