The underwhelming performance of Chelsea left-back Marc Cucurella caused tension between Jamie Carragher and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink post-match after Manchester City left Stamford Bridge with all three points following a 1-0 victory. The Spaniard was solid in the first half but after the interval, he was ruthlessly exposed by City as they went for the throat. The winning goal came courtesy of Riyad Mahrez, who tapped home at the back post after Jack Grealish slid the ball across the face of goal. Cucurella should have tracked his runner but Kept Arrizabalaga was also equally to blame for failing to claim the low cross. Carragher was not impressed by the performance of Cucurella, who cost Chelsea Â£63million from Brighton in the summer transfer window. "For me, I wasn't happy with Cucurella right throughout that second half," the ex-Liverpool defender said on Sky Sports.

"You've got to defend properly, you've got to stay on your feet." To which the former Chelsea striker responded: "I think his defending is bad but he was overloaded as well and he didn't get the help you should get. I'm not disagreeing with you." Carragher then joked: "Well I think you are." The Dutchman then took a chance to defend his comments: "I still think that he wants to defend but I just think he had a really bad game, Manchester City acknowledged that. 50 per cent of their attacks were over that side. That's targeting him. "I still think if he wants to defend, he's not a good defender."
