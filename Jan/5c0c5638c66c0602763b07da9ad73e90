Manchester United have been part of a busy January transfer window already as Erik ten Hag moved quickly to replace Cristiano Ronaldo with Burnley striker Wout Weghorst on loan until the end of the season. The Dutchman may not be done this month either, as there are still holes to fill in the squad as part of a potential title push with the Red Devils just eight points behind Premier League leaders Arsenal. United travel to Arsenal on Sunday in the hopes that their gap can be cut to five, and Ten Hag will have several decisions to make ahead of the trip to the Emirates. Weghorst started in the 1-1 draw at Crystal Palace, his first appearance since cutting his Besiktas loan short and moving to Old Trafford. Whether he will be joined by further additions in January remains to be seen, as Ten Hag has reportedly wished for another midfielder while Harry Kane has been linked with a blockbuster summer move and will have just a year left on his Tottenham contract at the end of the campaign.
