The father of four, 48, who appears on ITV’s This Morning, said he was compelled to help the thousands of former pets roaming the streets, as well as zoo bears and lions. The medic, from Surrey, who is travelling with charity Breaking the Chains, will work with local vets in Kherson in the south and Bakhmut in the east. Scott said his wife Zoe, 44, and their children, aged four to 13, understood his motivation. He said: “The animal welfare there is dire and people are making a difference every day. I have to go to raise awareness about what’s going on. “I know the risks and the indiscriminate bombing means you aren’t safe as soon as you cross the border. “But my wife is supportive, my kids understand. They know how much ­animal welfare means to me. “Animals are sentient beings with emotions, but don’t have a voice. My goal is to give them one and remind people it isn’t just humans suffering.”
