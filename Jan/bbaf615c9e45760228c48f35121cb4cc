A fire has broken out in a Russian military training camp, burning down the living quarters of at least a dozen men, in the latest incident to hit those training to go to fight in Ukraine. In a video shared online, a huge fire can be seen engulfing at least three tents in Tomsk, located in Siberia towards the southwest of Russia.    In the footage, sirens can be heard squealing as residents of the camp look to put out the fire. In freezing conditions, men can be heard furiously shouting as they deliberate over what to do. The flames reach several metres high with black smoke pouring several hundred feet into the air. According to local reports, three tens and some personal belongings were burned but there were no casualties.    Commentators have been quick to suggest the fire was caused by Russian soldiers desperate not to fight in Ukraine. There have been a number of unexplained fires and outbreaks in Russian training camps, increasingly since Vladimir Putin announced the mass mobilisation of 300,000 troops on September 21. One social media user, alongside the video, wrote: “Russians from Tomsk decided to burn their equipment and weapons in order to postpone their trip to war.” Another wrote: “In a military camp for mobilised soldiers in Tomsk, Russia they again broke the smoking rules. Russia never disappoints.” MORE TO FOLLOW...
