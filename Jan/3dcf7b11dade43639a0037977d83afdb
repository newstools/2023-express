Amanda Holden, 51, brought sunshine on a rainy day as she stepped out in a chic dog-tooth mini skirt paired with a white jumper. The presenter was pictured on her way from the Heart FM studios on Tuesday as she battled the rain with a large black umbrella. Amanda accentuated her toned legs with a pair of nude court heels which complemented her tan following a sun-soaked trip to Mauritius. The Britain's Got Talent judge accessorised with a nude bag and gold jewellery to match the detailing on her top and skirt. It comes as the talent show is set to begin filming the auditions this month, with Alan Carr recently announced as the replacement for David Walliams.
