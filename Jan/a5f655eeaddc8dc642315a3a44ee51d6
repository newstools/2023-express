The 2023 tennis season is officially up and running with the start of the Australian Open and the tournament has already thrown up a few surprises. Most notably, Nick Kyrgios is out of the tournament with the home favourite pulling out due to a knee injury. His withdrawal comes as a huge disappointment for the men's side of the draw with world No 1 Carlos Alcaraz also out of the tournament. The tough opening test for Britain's men began with a defeat for Kyle Edmund against Jannik Sinner. The biggest match of the day was arguably Rafael Nadal against Jack Draper though and the young Brit more than held his own in the opening exchanges. Meanwhile, Emma Raducnau put her injury fears behind her and sailed through to the second round with a win over Tamara Korpatsch. She will now take on American hope Coco Gauff in a testing second-round match. The top seeds have so far avoided any shock opening-round defeats, but Stefanos Tsitsipas, Daniil Medvedev, Felix Auger-Aliassime are all still to feature in Monday's order of play.
