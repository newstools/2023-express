Natasha Johnston died from "multiple penetrating dog bites to the neck" and a wound to her jugular vein, an inquest has heard. The 28-year-old was walking in Gravelly Hill, Caterham, Surrey on January 12 when she was attacked. Surrey police said eight dogs were seized and remain in police custody whilst they continue their investigation. At the opening of an inquest into her death, coroner Simon Wickens expressed his "sincere condolences" to Ms Johnston's family "and all those touched by her life". The coroner said on Tuesday: "A post-mortem examination was carried out at Royal Surrey County Hospital on 18 January. "The medical cause of death (was) given as 1a) shock and haemorrhage including perforation of the left jugular vein, and in 1b) the pathologist places multiple penetrating dog bites to her neck. "The reason for the inquest required is the nature of the traumatic injuries."  One witness described how the victim "screamed at us to turn back" as she was attacked. Ms Johnstons family have described it as an "extremely difficult time". In a statment they said: “This is an extremely difficult time for us and as well as dealing with this sudden loss in our family, the significant level of media interest and the graphic nature of some of the reporting, has been a source of additional distress,” the statement said. “We continue to appeal for our privacy to be respected during our time of grief.”
