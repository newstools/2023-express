Manchester United have already added goalkeeper Jack Butland to their ranks this month, and Erik ten Hag is keen to continue bolstering his ranks. The departure of Cristiano Ronaldo has prompted a search for a striker over the coming weeks, with several cut-price options identified. Wout Weghorst was approached last week following his impressive Qatar World Cup campaign with the Netherlands. The forward is currently on loan at Besiktas from Burnley, though confidence is growing that a deal between all three sides can be reached. The 30-year-old appears to have already accepted a move to Old Trafford, waving goodbye to Besiktas fans on Saturday following his goal against Kasimpasa. A deal is expected to be reached for Weghorst by the end of the week, with the striker set to provide an alternative option to Anthony Martial up top. Though he may not be the last arrival at the Theatre of Dreams this month, Express Sport bring you all the latest.
