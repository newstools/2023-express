The United States is moving towards green lighting the delivery of F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine, in what would be another major blow for Vladimir Putin. President Zelensky told reporters after a meeting with Nato head Jens Stoltenberg last week that acquiring fighter jets was a "dream" and an "important task".
