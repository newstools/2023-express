Last weekend ITV viewers watched actress Carley Stenson make her Dancing on Ice debut with her professional partner Mark Hanretty. Although she blew the judges away with her routine, the 40-year-old exclusively told Express.co.uk what Oti Mabuse told her before starring in the show. This month, the popular ITV skating competition returned to screens with a fresh batch of 11 stars taking to the ice for the first time.With the celebrity's grand debuts being split across two weeks, Hollyoaks star Carley Stenson was grouped with the second half of the stars who got to sit back and watch their competition skate on the opening night.Performing her routine for the first time last Sunday evening, the 40-year-old blew the four judges away after earning the highest score of the night.Putting her at the top of the leaderboard, the actress earned a total of 32 out of a possible 40 with each person on the panel giving them an eight for their impressive performance.
