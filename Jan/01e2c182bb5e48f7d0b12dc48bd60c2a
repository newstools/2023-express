Scotland's National Clinical Director has urged those who are unwell to stay away from work in order to help the NHS. Jason Leitch said people should not "lose hope" about the state of the health service, which has come under severe pressure. On Tuesday, senior medics said they have never been more concerned about the standards of acute medical care in hospitals across the UK. Some have described ambulances queueing outside emergency departments and being forced to treat patients outside the doors of the hospital. Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Scotland Radio programme, Professor Leitch said A&E is not the only part of the health service feeling the squeeze He said: "If we lose hope, then we're in trouble. So there are things we can do in the system to make it better." Meanwhile an elderly woman told her family she wanted to die after she was left on a trolley at a Liverpool hospital for 33 hours in another illustration of the crisis gripping the NHS. Graeme Smith called an ambulance after his 92-year-old grandmother, a care home resident, became ill on New Year's Eve. However, after enduring a long wait for it to arrive, they then had to join a queue of vehicles waiting to access the Aintree Hospital - and even then their problems were only beginning. Mr Smith told the Liverpool Echo: "She arrived at the hospital at 9pm but didn't get a place on a ward until 6am on January 2. She was praying and asking to be taken. I've never heard her say anything like that before." David Melia, Chief Nurse at Liverpool University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said: “Our staff are working incredibly hard to provide safe care for patients in what are extremely challenging circumstances."
