American tennis star Jessica Pegula has revealed she "felt sick" after Buffalo Bills player Damar Hamlin collapsed on the field against the Cincinnati Bengals on Monday night. The 24-year-old defensive back got back to his feet after making a routine tackle against the Cincinnati Bengals in the first quarter, but then fell back down to the ground. Medical staff quickly attended to him and administered CPR, with players from both teams visibly distraught. The Bills later released a statement confirming the player had suffered a cardiac arrest, adding: "His heartbeat was restored on the field and he was transferred to the UC Medical Center for further testing and treatment. He is currently sedated and listed in critical condition." The franchise is owned by Pegula's father Terry, one of the wealthiest people in America. Earlier on Monday, she'd beaten Germany's Laura Siegemund in her United Cup clash in Australia, and was supporting teammate Frances Tiafoe whilst following the Bills on her phone when Hamlin went down. “When that happened, we didn’t watch much of the game," she said in her press conference. "It happened at the end of the first quarter. It’s just terrible. Just terrible. There’s really no words. I’m glad they stopped the game. It just brings you to the fact there are a lot bigger and more important things than sports and games."

But she has also forged her own path in professional tennis, making the quarter finals in three of the four Grand Slam events in 2022. She's currently ranked a career high No 3 in the world.
