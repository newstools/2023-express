The January transfer window is finally set to come to an end tonight after a hectic few weeks of business, with a large number of clubs in England and across Europe expected to be in the market for late signings right up until this evening's 11pm cut-off point. The likes of Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester United and Tottenham could be among those looking to add to their respective squads over the next few hours as they look to finalise their preparations for the all-important Premier League run-in. Chelsea have spent considerably more than any other Premier League club over the last few transfer windows and may end up splashing another mega-money fee on a deadline day move for Enzo Fernandez, who they targeted at the start of this month but to no avail. The Blues are thought to have returned to the table with a last-gasp bid in the region of Â£105million, which is said to match the value of the 22-year-old's release clause at Benfica. Arsenal may also be set to welcome a new midfielder to the Emirates Stadium today in the form of Moises Caicedo, who is keen to leave Brighton after the Gunners saw a previous offer rejected earlier this week. The Seagulls are under no financial pressure to sell the Ecuador international, though, leading to the emergence of Chelsea playmaker Jorginho as an alternative target for Arsenal if they fail to get a deal for Caicedo over the line.
