Instead, the Royal Family will put on a united front as Harry launches his book Spare and gives more TV interviews, the writer insisted. Mr Morton said: “Harry’s book will cause concern, and it will make headlines around the world, but it won’t destroy the institution. And if the institution is so weak that it can’t stand a ghostwritten book by a junior member, then it’s probably not worth keeping. “I mean, quite frankly, a book written by a future queen, Diana, and a book by the future King Charles would be far more relevant and important than a book by someone like Harry who is rapidly going down the hierarchy. "The Royal Family are now bracing for the coronation coming up in May. So, you get the sense palace officials are on tenterhooks, making sure that for King Charles, people aren’t reminded of his emotional hinterland as it were. “And with Harry’s memoir as well, they are concerned that will affect the way people perceive King Charles. “When you call the book Spare, there’s a clue that it’s going to be about being in the shadow of his brother and, similarly, his relationship with his father.” Mr Morton sees no problem with Harry, who is fifth in line to the throne, earning money from his story. He added: “Harry’s got every right to write his memoir. He’s not the first royal to do so, nor will he be the last.” Mr Morton’s 1992 book Diana: Her True Story was an international bestseller.
