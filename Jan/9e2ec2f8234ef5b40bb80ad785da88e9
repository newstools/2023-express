A suspected ‘gas leak’ has caused a major Leeds venue to be evacuated, forcing hundreds of people to exit the building. Men and women were funnelled out of the venue at around 8.30pm after the fire alarm went off during a Paul Chowdhry gig. Shortly after the evacuation the venue announced the show would be cancelled. One woman, named Mo, who was at the show, told LeedsLive: “It's frustrating. I don't want to be too negative about it. It is what it is. Anticipating the next show.” Hundreds of people can be seen gathered outside the venue with viewers saying it's "ridiculous". The relevant emergency services have been contacted for comment. The Paul Chowdry show at the City Varieties has been turbulent. It was pushed back twice and meant to occur in mid April. One event goer tweeted: "Paul Chowdhry would rather burn down the @CityVarieties than play a full gig there. It was an amazing 30 minutes before he set fire to his dressing room." Another tweeted: "He was class. Absolutely gutted. Second trip to Leeds after the last show cancelled."  Paul, 48, is a regular on panel shows and the stand-up circuit in the UK, and previously presented Stand Up for the Week.  Last year, the much-loved comic was involved in a terrifying incident earlier which led a fan to intervene. He confirmed he was attacked while ‘in his car’ after the witness messaged him to check whether he was okay. He told his followers on social media: "I was attacked in my car yesterday in London. I’m fine and I will update you as soon as I can." READ MORE: Former MP allegedly ‘faked £30k expenses to fund his drug habit'
