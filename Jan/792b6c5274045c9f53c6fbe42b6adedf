Vladimir Putin has been accused of breaking his own war ceasefire after Ukrainians claims Russian forces opened fire in several areas. The Russian President ordered his armed forces to observe a 36-hour ceasefire - starting at 12pm local time on Friday - to coincide with the Orthodox Christmas. But a rescue worker from Ukraine has already been killed in a Russian strike, while the strategic city of Donetsk came under fire, according to Russian state TV. Russia's defence ministry insisted it was observing the truce along the entire "line of contact" and that its forces only returned fire after Russian positions were attacked by the Ukrainian army.
