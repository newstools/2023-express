Of course, his wife was caught out last year avoiding tax – albeit using the legal loophole of ‘non-dom’ status, set up for extremely wealthy people. The problem for politicians is that they live in a vacuum and sometimes don’t realise when we’ve all moved on. We (collectively) used to watch Benny Hill, smoke inside, and not wear seatbelts. But the national culture has moved on and these things are no longer okay. Tax avoidance is a little like that. It used to be in vogue, a glamorous game of cat and mouse with the killjoy tax inspector. Until it wasn’t. Our society now realises that paying for nurses, teachers, our armed forces, the police, and a safety net are good. We like having them around. Tax is not something to be avoided, it is an investment in our society and in our country. It is the price we pay for being in it, and thriving, together. Which means that people won’t put up with being governed by wealthy elites who avoid paying the taxes so desperately needed to fund failing public services - services that too many ministers don’t use because they’ve gone private. There is literally nothing more unpatriotic than wealthy politicians avoiding their tax contributions. This bigger point makes it obvious that Zahawi will have to go, regardless of what the ethics advisor says about the narrowly scoped question he’s been posed.  Rishi Sunak needs to wake up to the culture shift that has taken place around tax. An ethics advisor can’t give him basic common sense, decency, or the zeitgeist. If he wants to show us that he has these things, here’s three things he can do: Start by firing Zahawi; follow up with closing the non-dom loophole that his family used - raising £3.2billion; and end with a tax on extreme wealth over £10m to rebalance the tax system away from its unfair focus on work and working people, raising another £10 billion. Extreme wealth holders can afford it, and we want to live in a decent society.
