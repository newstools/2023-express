Catherine Zeta Jones opted for a metallic gold and black dress which featured a plunging neckline and nipped at her waist before falling into a long skirt with a small train. The mum-of-two wore her signature brunette tresses in loose waves as they cascaded down past her shoulders. She rocked a smokey eye with a bronze-hued palatte and added a light burgundy lip to finish off her look. Michael looked dapper in a navy suit with a white shirt and polka dot tie as he joined his wife for photos on the red carpet. Catherine took to her Instagram stories and shared a photo alongside her beau as she enjoyed the couple's date night.
