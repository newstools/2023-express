Zachary Levi is back as DC Comics superhero Shazam, in an action-packed sequel co-starring West Side Story's Rachel Zegler, Lucy Liu and Helen Mirren as the daughters of Atlas. The synopsis reads: "When Billy Batson and his foster siblings, who transform into superheroes by saying "Shazam!", are forced to get back into action and fight the Daughters of Atlas, they must stop them from using a weapon that could destroy the world in which they must travel in order to make peace with the Gods because of Billy taking their powers for granted." Shazam! Fury of the Gods hits UK cinemas on March 17, 2023.
