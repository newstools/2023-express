However, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have been urged to hand back their titles after their "betrayal" of Britain. Writing on Twitter, British conservative commentator, and former aide to Margaret Thatcher, Nile Gardiner, wrote: "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle do not deserve to carry royal titles. "Their vicious campaign against the Royal Family is a betrayal of the British people. They have become the most unpopular and distrusted couple in the modern history of the British Monarchy." In a poll conducted by YouGov in December, Prince Harryâ€™s popularity is shown to have tumbled even more over the winter season, as his wife, Meghan Markle, continues to fall out of favour among Britons. The only other Royal Family member shown as less popular than the couple is Harry's uncle, Prince Andrew.
