Manchester UnitedÂ boss Erik ten Hag still appears to be scanning the market for potential new signings with just five days left until the end of the January transfer window. The Red Devils have already moved to improve their ranks with the temporary additions of goalkeeper Jack Butland and Dutch forward Wout Weghorst, who joined on loan from Crystal Palace and Burnley respectively earlier this month. It seems as though another forward could soon be joining Weghorst at Old Trafford if Ten Hag gets his way, with several high-profile names having been linked with United over the last few days. Juventus marksman Federico Chiesa is said to be on Ten Hag's list of potential targets, although the Italian giants could reportedly demand a mega-money fee in order to let the 25-year-old leave between now and the end of this month. Marcus Thuram of Borussia Monchengladbach is also said to be of interest to United, who could decide to snap him up on a pre-contract agreement as a result of his current situation in Germany. Meanwhile, it is claimed that as many as three Red Devils youngsters could be on their way out of Old Trafford over the coming days to seal loan moves to clubs lower down in the English football pyramid.
