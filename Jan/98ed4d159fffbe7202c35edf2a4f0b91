Shania Twain, 57, was all smiles today as she was pictured arriving at the Today show in New York City. The singer looked great as she showed off her pink tresses with a bouncy blow-dry. She accompanied the look with a long leather jacket and a white and black printed skirt. Shania then paired this with a tight-fitted black top and thigh-high boots, as she smiled at onlookers. The Hollywood star also showed off her ageless complexion with her bronzed makeup and peach glossy lips. This comes after Shania recently opened up about her "menopausal" body in an interview with PEOPLE magazine.
