Novak Djokovic voiced his frustration early on in his Australian Open quarter-final after a spectator heckled him from the stands. The fourth seed previously called for a group of hecklers to be kicked out of his third-round match deep in the fourth set but he wasn't going to let it slide this time around as he told them to "shut up" and ranted about their behaviour towards umpire James Keothavong during the sixth game. Djokovic quickly lost his patience with a heckler just a handful of games into his quarter-final clash with Rublev after dealing with disruptive spectators in his previous matches. With the fifth seed serving at 1-4, a member of the crowd started shouting "Send him home Rublev" while the Serb was waiting to return and he called them out immediately. "Why don't you shut up?" he responded. "Every single point, every single point." The nine-time Aussie Open champion then turned to umpire James Keothavong and told him: "You're not reacting." It's not the first time Djokovic has dealt with a spectator trying to put him off, as a group of fans were removed late in his second-round match while another managed to stay for the duration of his fourth-round tie against Alex de Minaur. And the fourth seed approached the umpire to discuss the issue again after taking the first set 6-1.

"I don’t mind him supporting him but he has been commenting three, four times on a row he’s saying things to provoke me. That’s what I’m saying. Please just pay attention." The heckler was also slammed on commentary, as Chris Bradnam called out the ongoing "issue" of spectators trying to put Djokovic off. "He’s gone early this time Djokovic, with the heckler," he said, referring to the Serb's last few matches that saw him wait until the fourth set to voice his complaints about the off-putting crowd members.

They got expelled eventually but it took way too long," Bradham continued. "And his last match the same. And that heckler stayed throughout. It’s an issue. They’re trying to get under his skin and he’s reacted early tonight Djokovic, and you can hardly blame him."
