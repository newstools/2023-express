A Kraft Heinz spokesperson said: “Like the rest of the food industry, we continue to face significantly increased production costs – whether it’s ingredients, energy, or packaging – and rising inflation. Our energy prices alone have increased by 609 percent since 2019. “We’re absorbing costs wherever we can, however we've reluctantly had to increase our prices to retailers – a measure that continues to be a last resort. “We understand the pressures consumers are currently facing. To help offset these, we’re working collaboratively with retailers to offer great value through regular promotions and promotional cycles across a range of our products. We’ve adapted our offer to consumers with different pack sizes, value ranges and lower price points. We are also continuing to look for efficiencies in our operations. “We remain committed to giving our consumers great tasting and nutritious products without compromising on the quality they know and trust, and continuing to invest back into the more than 3,000 people we employ across the UK.” Heinz price increases Heinz Tomato Ketchup 910g - price increase from £2.49 to £3.99 Heinz Beanz 200g 3x - price increase from £1 to £1.79 Heinz Splash!
