Nearly 40 years ago the plight of millions ruined by a famine ravishing Ethiopia was highlighted by the charity single Do They Know it's Christmas? Yet Christian Aid argues the iconic campaign, along with Live Aid in 1985, has since "shaped for the worse how people think about hunger, poverty and aid," with many seeing the Horn of Africa as a lost cause. Writing in today's Sunday Express, the charity's chief executive Patrick Watt warns "donor fatigue" has now crept in.  Arguing that "Band Aid casts a long shadow", he called for a "move to a more hopeful and accurate depiction of the challenge of extreme hunger, and what can be done about it". Currently, the worst drought in 40 years has left around 36 million people across East Africa facing the threat of famine. Multiple agencies have launched appeals for donations, but he said few people were aware of what was happening. In 1984 Bob Geldof and Midge Ure founded Band Aid after the BBC's reporting of the famine that started in 1983. It affected 7.75 million people, a fifth of Ethiopia's population, and left 1.2 million dead and 200,000 children orphaned. The single went to No.1 that Christmas and sparked a global charity drive which raised more than Â£125million.  Mr Watt said: "Band Aid's 1985 hit single made it more difficult for the UK public to ignore one of the gravest famines of modern times, and spurred a huge outpouring of humanitarian concern. Yet it reinforced deeply troubling tropes about helpless Africans and white saviours that continues to shape for the worse how people in the UK think about hunger, poverty and aid. "This matters right now because East Africa faces the most severe hunger crisis in a generation, brought about by five failed rainy seasons, conflict, indebtedness, and spiralling food and energy costs." He called on the Government to increase financial donations and for the tragedy unfolding to be told to new audiences.
