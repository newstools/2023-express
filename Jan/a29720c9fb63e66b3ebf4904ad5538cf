Over the last 60 years, there have been six actors who have officially played James Bond. Unsurprisingly, as Hollywood leading men, they are all pretty dashing. Yet now their handsomeness has been ranked according to the Golden Ratio of Beauty Phi, a measurement of physical perfection according to the Ancient Greeks. The research was conducted by Gambling.com, which uploaded their portraits from the official James Bond website to the Golden Ratio Face app which presents a Face Beauty Analysis score out of 10. And it turns out that Timothy Dalton is the most aesthetically pleasing of all six official Bond actors. The 1980s 007 only played the spy twice in The Living Daylights and Licence To Kill. Originally he was set to return for third movie GoldenEye in 1995, but wouldn't commit to more movies and so Pierce Brosnan was cast. Interestingly, the latter was the first choice for The Living Daylights back in 1987 but couldn't get out of his TV contract for Remington Steele at the time. Here is the full ranking. 1. Timothy Dalton 92. Pierce Brosnan 7.963. Daniel Craig 7.594. Sean Connery 7.535. George Lazenby 7.246. Roger Moore 6.36 The research also ranked the most handsome potential next Bond stars based on some of the bookies’ favourites and here are the results: READ MORE: James Bond – Mel Gibson turned down 007 because of Sean Connery 1.
