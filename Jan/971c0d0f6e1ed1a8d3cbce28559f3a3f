January marks Veganuary and this year, Hellmans reported that one in ten Brits will be participating in the plant-based challenge. Regardless if you’re participating in it or not, eating more vegan meals is a great way to improve your health, especially as 58 percent of Brits look to start creating healthier habits in the new year. Amazon Fresh is the perfect online grocery to source fresh foods with cheaper prices than popular UK supermarkets. To coincide with Veganuary, shoppers can now buy new by Amazon vegan ready meals and it’s been praised for being ‘absolutely delicious’. With prices starting from just £3.09 up, it’s perfect if you’re also busy as each meal only needs to be heated up and is ready in five minutes. Nutritious, tasty and time efficient, each item is also guaranteed to stay fresh for two or more days. One of the highlights from the new by Amazon range is the Thai Red Butternut Squash Curry, which is £4.50. Delightfully packed with a decent hint of spice, it contains a mixture of lightly spiced coconut, red chilli sauce, roasted butternut squash and is topped with fresh vegetables. Another popular standout is the by Amazon Dhal Vegetable Bowl for one, which is £4 and loved by shoppers. Bluefin71 commented: “Tasty, hearty and filing.” Plus, for Mac & Cheese lovers, by Amazon has a plant-based version that’s now on offer for only £3.09 and is also ideal for those that have lactose sensitivities. Nathan wrote: “Really creamy and yummy! Hard to find decent vegan versions of this. The sauce was nice and creamy, the pasta well cooked and not too soft.” Another ready meal that shoppers praised is the by Amazon Tofu Gochujang with Jasmine Rice, and is only £4 but packed with delicious flavours and spice. KC loved it and said: “This was a lot nicer than I expected it to be. Full of flavour and light fluffy rice. Wish it was a little cheaper, but it's a nice meal.”
