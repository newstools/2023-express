Megan Markle and Prince Harry's brand is "not founded on them as humanitarian leaders but on the never-ending, multiverse of family misery", a Royal Family commentator has claimed.

"For the duke and duchess in 2023, their brand is not founded on them as humanitarian leaders but on the never-ending, multiverse of family misery that is Harry and Meghan versus the House of Windsor. "I suppose it comes down to the fact that their charitable work does not feel like the defining force in terms of their public image." FOLLOW THIS LIVEBLOG FOR UPDATES ON THE ROYAL FAMILY
