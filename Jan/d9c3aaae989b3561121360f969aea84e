Lower kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanity units may seem like the ideal place to stack up household items, though cleaning experts have warned against keeping certain products in these accessible places. The conditions of such storage spots - which are oftentimes damp and dark - can create a nasty breeding ground for mould and mildew which can ruin certain materials. And it's not just harmful spores to watch out for, with rust and waterlogging also an issue when water leaks occur.   According to Jennifer Rodriguez, chief hygiene officer at Pro Housekeepers, essential items like bin bags and cleaning supplies will go unharmed beneath your kitchen sink, but the same can't be said for some popular cooking appliances. The hygiene expert explained that slow cookers, pressure cookers, and blenders are better off elsewhere if you've made a habit of keeping them near household plumbing. She added: "They could get damaged by any leaks coming from the sink." Even if you are reassured that your plumbing is leak-free, a builder at Prime Custom Builders warned that moisture in general "can be a risk" to electronic devices. They noted that dampness "may rust vital components over time", and that tools - even if non-powered, are also "vulnerable to moisture", as it can "cause rust and corrosion over time".
