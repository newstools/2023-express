Novak Djokovic was left fuming as a spectator continued to call out and disrupt his service motion. The fourth seed had joked about it earlier in the match but ranted to umpire Fergus Murphy in the fourth set as it continued to happen, demanding that the crowd member in question be kicked out and claiming he was "drunk out of his mind". Djokovic was left battling against more than just his opponent Enzo Couacaud during his second-round match as he struggled with his hamstring injury while a member of the crowd continued to shout out during his service motion. The umpire had reminded the Rod Laver Arena crowd about etiquette multiple times and another fan had even grown tired of the interruptions, telling them to "shut up" earlier in the match which prompted the Serb to jokingly thank them. But the nine-time champion Down Under grew tired of the interruptions in the fourth set after yet another shout came during his service game, prompting him to approach Fergus Murphy's chair and call on him to take more action. "The guy is drunk out of his mind, from the first point he's been provoking me," the 35-year-old claimed. "He's not here to watch tennis, he just wants to get in my head." Murphy's response wasn't picked up on the broadcast of the match, but it clearly left Djokovic unhappy.

What are you going to do about it? Get him out of the stadium," he continued. Murphy reminded fans not to disrupt play, but at the end of the game, the spectators in question were thrown out of the match as the rest of the Rod Laver Arena crowd turned to watch. It came after Eurosport's commentators Chris Bradnam and Tim Henman were left frustrated by the spectators themselves just a few games earlier. "Youngster shouting out just as he was serving there, they’ve somehow got to get a grip on this. It’s becoming too much, it really is. Just respect them more, seriously," Bradnam said.

I mean, he’s tried Fergus Murphy to ask can you please not call out between first and second serves or as they’re serving but it continues to happen." And the retired former world No 4 had the same idea as Djokovic, calling for them to be chucked out. "Yeah there’s only a certain amount the umpire can do because he’s sitting on a chair in the middle of the playing arena but you do need the help of the stewards within this stadium. If they see people continuing to call out, trying to disturb play then they need to be thrown out," he said.
