New Year’s Eve is one of the most anticipated celebrations of the year, with celebrities being second to none in boasting lavish parties and get-togethers. But how did Britain’s best-known stars welcome in 2023?  David Beckham, 47, and Victoria Beckham, 48, looked more loved up than ever as they enjoyed an intimate festive dinner with their youngest children. The couple posed for a snap together - with the former footballer wearing some reindeer sunglasses - before enjoying the fireworks with sons Romeo, 20, and Cruz, 17, and daughter Harper, 11. Brooklyn Beckham, 23, saw in the start of 2023 with wife Nicola Peltz, 27, and her family, as well as a number of friends. The couple celebrated with singer Selena Gomez, 30, at a luxurious beach party with sparklers and a fireworks display included. Britain’s Got Talent star Amanda Holden, 51, spent New Year’s Eve on a tropical holiday tucking into a lavish dinner with her two look-alike daughters. For the special occasion, the broadcaster donned a white feather-trimmed dress that contrasted with her eldest daughter Lexie’s black, one-shoulder satin dress. Denise Van Outen, 48, rang in the new year dancing alongside her boyfriend Jimmy Barba, after spending Christmas in Dubai together. The presenter, who was in charge of DJing for her friends, dazzled in a sparkly, sequinned cardigan and a black short-sleeved top. Taking to Instagram to share an insight into her lavish night, Eternal star Louise Redknapp, 48, shared a video of the fireworks display in London. She also uploaded a series of photo booth snaps alongside her friends, as well as a clip of the swimming pool area at Soho House.
