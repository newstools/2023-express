Buckingham Palace has been blindsided by the slew of attacks that have rained down on the Royal Family from Harry’s bombshell autobiography. But just four months before his Coronation, forgiving Charles remains confident he can heal the rift that has pushed the relationship between his sons to breaking point. The King is desperate for his day to be a national and global celebration and not descend into a circus. A royal source claimed he would attempt to broker peace talks in the coming weeks. They said: “It’s fixable. Both sides need to hold their hands up and admit ‘we didn’t get everything right, and we got a lot wrong’. It’s going to take flexibility on all sides, but it can be done. “It needs Harry here, in the room with the King and Prince of Wales, a couple of other family members, some of ‘his people’ he trusts, so he doesn’t think he’s being ambushed.” In 2020, Harry, 38, left London on a “freedom flight” for California, where he now lives with his former actress wife Meghan, 41, and children Archie Harrison, three, and daughter Lilibet Diana, one. He claimed his family had been portrayed as “villains”, saying of senior royals: “They’ve shown absolutely no willingness to reconcile.” Harry’s memoir Spare, released last week, contains a slew of incendiary claims, including that an irate William physically attacked him during an explosive row. Yet Charles and Harry are understood to have remained in close contact throughout the furore. It is hoped Harry will take his place with his father and brother at Westminster Abbey on May 6. During interviews to publicise his book, Harry said: “I would like to get my father back. I would like to have my brother back.” The Palace has stayed silent throughout the furore but a source told the Daily Express: “[Charles] loves both his sons and hope springs eternal for a happier future all round.”
