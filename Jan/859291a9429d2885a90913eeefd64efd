Chelsea boss Graham Potter was caught on camera saying “this is f***ing bulls***” following Joao Felix's red card against Fulham. Chelsea headed into the match against Fulham in dire need of a win and the signing of Felix was seen as a huge boost for Potter's squad. Talking before the game, Potter admitted that he hoped Felix's arrival would provide his side with a boost. And the Portuguese star was thrown straight into the starting line-up just days after his move to Stamford Bridge was confirmed. But Felix ended up having a debut to forget after he was shown a straight red card for a dangerous tackle on Kenny Tete. Replays showed that Felix went in with his studs showing and failed to make any attempt to pull out of the challenge. The referee didn't wait long before giving Felix his marching orders, leaving Potter flustered on the touchline.

It gives the Chelsea boss another headache moving forward though with the new signing now unavailable for their next three games. The Blues are back in action on Sunday when they host Crystal Palace before a tricky trip to Anfield next week against Liverpool. Felix won't be eligible to make his return until next month when Chelsea travel to face relegation-threatened West Ham. Pressure will now likely increase on Potter too with the defeat to Fulham stretching Chelsea's wretched record. They've now won just one of their last nine league fixtures and are 10 points adrift of the Champions League places. Injuries have taken their toll on Potter's side with Raheem Sterling, Christian Pulisic, Eduoard Mendy, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, N'Golo Kante, Reece James, Wesley Fofana, Ben Chilwell and Armando Broja all unavailable. But Potter looks set for even more injury heartache after Denis Zakaria was forced off with a knock against Fulham. It leaves just Jorginho, Mateo Kovacic and Conor Gallagher as the only senior midfield options if Zakaria is ruled out for a period of time.
