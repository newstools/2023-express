Greater Manchester Police are urging the public to help identify an attacker who sexually assaulted a woman in her 60s. The incident took place on Smallshaw Lane in Ashton-Under-Lyne. The woman was walking her dog when an unknown man approached her. He has been described as a man in his 20s, of slender build, and between 5ft 10 and 5ft 11. Police say the attacker was also wearing all dark clothing with a hood over his head, and a snood to cover his nose and mouth to give only a partial view of his face. Police are now following up on a number of enquiries but are urging the public to help with identifying the man. Detective Superintendent Richard Hunt said: "Our specialist officers are supporting the victim at this time and we want to do all we can to locate the offender. "You will see officers out and about on foot over the next couple of days making enquires and offering reassurance to the community as we move forward with this investigation.
