But, according to reports this week, that could be the fate of the farcical HS2 project, as bosses weigh up delaying the Euston terminus to 2038 or even scrapping the link to central London altogether. In this scenario, the trains would run from a new terminus at Old Oak Common, which is a 20 minute tube ride from Oxford Circus in central London. Jeremy Hunt is insistent that this isn’t the plan, but does the chancellor protest too much? The TaxPayers’ Alliance has always opposed HS2. The case for such a massive spend was never a strong one, given the many other ways taxpayer cash could be put to use. Now with the pandemic-driven changes to how we travel and how we work, the case for this particular rail link has only grown weaker. At a time when the NHS is in crisis and services are stretched, this money would be better spent hiring new nurses and increasing NHS capacity. Or it could fund the full abolition of stamp duty for three years, helping families to move up the housing ladder and allowing older people to move into homes that better suit their needs. In the spirit of levelling up, the cash could be used to improve local road, rail and bus networks between and within our towns, connecting people to their high streets and supporting local businesses. And to be told by the Chancellor that it’s not quite the time for tax cuts, as we were this week, sticks in the throat given the HS2 shambles. There is a long list of better uses of £60 billion than linking the midlands to a station just round the corner from the Wormwood Scrubs prison. While costs have spiralled for this white elephant, some may think that, with so much money already spent on the scheme, should we persist with HS2 and see it through? But why throw good money after bad? It would be far better for taxpayers if this vanity project hit the buffers now. It’s time for ministers to show some backbone and pull the plug on this sorry scheme.
