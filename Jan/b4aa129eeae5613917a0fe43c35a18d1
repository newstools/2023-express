The Duchess of Sussex was said to have been left "upset" by Pippa Middleton's initial decision not to invite her to her wedding, a commentator reported. Looking into the lukewarm at best relationship between Kate, Princess of Wales, and Meghan over the years, royal commentator Camilla Tominey recalled reports concerning the May 2017 nuptials between James Matthews and Pippa. Kate's sister "initially declined" to invite Meghan to her big day, Ms Tominey wrote, "perhaps fearing she would be upstaged by Harry’s girlfriend". However, she "later relented" and invited the now Duchess to the evening reception that followed the service "to keep the peace", Ms Tominey wrote in The Telegraph. Ms Tominey added Kate and Prince William "took exception" to the Sussexes moving the name places at the table after the bride had organised for no couple to sit together during the reception. Meghan's attendance at Pippa's wedding was also discussed by Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand in their unofficial biography of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Finding Freedom. In it, the authors claimed the "media frenzy" that followed Meghan and Harry even when they were only a few months into their relationship "made them somewhat a reluctant addition to the guest list" for the nuptials. The authors went on to claim both Pippa and her mother Carole Middleton "privately harboured concerns that the American actress' presence alongside Harry might overshadow the main event". The book, however, claimed Harry and Meghan had "agreed" she couldn't turn up at the church following reports in the media about the bride-to-be and the now Duchess' physical appearance. While Harry attended the nuptials alone, the Duchess took part in the party that followed. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES…
