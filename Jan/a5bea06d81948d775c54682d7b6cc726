Police have ordered drone users to avoid an airbase used by the Red Arrows for low-flying training. The display team was recently granted permission to carry out the practice flights until April 17.  The police have told drone users to avoid RAF Syerston near Newark on Trent in Nottinghamshire, as they do not want a repeat of last summer. It comes as a drone pilot recently pleaded guilty to endangering an RAF flight over a carnival in Buxton, Derbyshire, last year, reports Nottinghamshire Live. Sergeant Vince Saunders, chief drone pilot at Nottinghamshire Police, said: "Drones can be great fun to fly but they can also pose a significant danger to low-flying aircraft. "With the world-famous Red Arrows display team now operating in the skies above Nottinghamshire, we are reminding all users to take additional care about where and when they fly." The low-flying training would previously have taken place at RAF Scampton in Lincolnshire, the former home of the Red Arrows, which closed in September as part of cost-cutting measures by the Ministry of Defence. The new restrictions around RAF Syerston ban all aircraft, including drones, from a five-mile radius around the base. Sergeant Saunders added: "The current restrictions in and around RAF Syerston are applied on a rolling basis and it is the responsibility of all drone operators to check when those restrictions are in place. "A drone operator in Buxton, Derbyshire, was recently convicted of endangering a flight by the RAF’s Battle of Britain Memorial Flight and we are keen to avoid any similar incidents in Nottinghamshire." The Red Arrows are the aerobatic display team of the Royal Air Force. The team was formed in 1964.
