Stunning video shows the moment where a barista narrowly avoids an apparent kidnapping. A woman working at a drive-through cafe can be seen on CCTV narrowly escaping a manâ€™s grip. A video shows a male customer in a Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck, having pulled in at the cafe. The man is seen clasping the barista's arm as she hands him the change and pulling it towards his car. Within seconds, the woman pulls her hand back managing to escape, and slams the drive-through window closed. The man then drops the money and drives away. During the struggle, the driver also appears to place a zip tie around the woman's wrist. The incident took place in Auburn, Washington state, early in the morning of Monday, January 16. The owner of the coffee shop told KOMO News her entire staff is shaken up following the terrifying incident, and that the woman has worked at the coffee shop for 15 years. Auburn Police Department asked the public for information in order to identify the suspect, and, after what they said was "overwhelming support from the community", the suspect was located and arrested. A unique tattoo on his left arm that seems to read 'Chevrolet' was what helped the authorities identify him, police said.

She was working alone at the time of the incident, KIRO-TV reported.
