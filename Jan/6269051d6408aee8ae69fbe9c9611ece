Erik ten Hag has overseen a number of positive changes at Manchester United over the last few months but will still be looking to improve his squad between now and the end of the January transfer window. The Red Devils have already managed to boost their attacking ranks with the capture of Wout Weghorst, who has joined United on loan from Burnley for the rest of the season. Several other players have been linked with moves to United in recent weeks, with Ten Hag still on the lookout for additional reinforcements in advance of the Premier League run-in. RB Leipzig forward Dani Olmo is said to be among the many names on United's shortlist and has reportedly been watched closely by the Red Devils, who are said to be weighing up a move for his services in the not-too-distant future. Brentford goalkeeper David Raya is thought to be another potential target for Ten Hag, who is keen on finding a new man between the sticks before the start of next season as a result of David de Gea's contract situation. The small matter of a new deal for breakout star Alejandro Garnacho is also high on United's to-do list, although it remains to be seen whether the Argentine forward will eventually sign on the dotted line after rejecting an initial proposal earlier this month.
