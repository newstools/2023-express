Grand Designs TV presenter Kevin McCloud is backing the new proposal - which could save 50,000 historic buildings from the wrecking ball each year. He said: "Any safeguard that places on any historical structure a presumption in favour of protection is a good thing.  "It would be a mechanism which asks a developer, an owner, an architect, 'What's the opportunity for reuse?'" He cited M&S plans - currently awaiting an inspector's report - to demolish its flagship Oxford Street store as an example of a culture of "demolishing, removing and throwing away". Buildings around the country could be saved and repurposed either for housing, work or leisure. A new Grade III listing would also be environmentally friendly - cutting carbon emissions from demolition and development. It is also hoped it would help save ancient buildings from neglect, while unsightly structures could be given new leases of life.  The idea has attracted interest from MPs and public bodies after appearing in an article by architect Will Arnold for the Architects' Journal (AJ). The AJ says hundreds of architects support the idea of exploring the prospect of refurbishing buildings before demolition. Grade III would be a way of enshrining this concept in law. Mr Arnold said: "The status would apply automatically to every building and come with just one rule: the property may only be demolished if structurally unsafe, or given special dispensation." He said the benefits of a Grade III would be swift, adding: "The quickest way to create housing is to take an existing building and turn it into housing."
