The NFL has confirmed there is no date set for Monday Night Football's suspended Buffalo Bills vs Cincinnati Bengals game to be resumed. Bills star Damar Hamlin collapsed after suffering a cardiac arrest during the first quarter of the game. Hamlin, 24, went down after making a routine tackle on Bengal wide receiver Tee Higgins during the opening quarter. He took a heavy blow to the chest from Higgins' helmet, and was sent crashing to the turf. After getting up, he immediately fell to the floor again as his heart went into cardiac arrest. Paramedics performed CPR on him and took him straight to hospital in an ambulance. The game was postponed, and while the NFL schedule is the least of anyone's concerns, the league confirmed on Tuesday afternoon that there was no date set for the game to resume. The statement read: "The NFL continues to be in regular contact with the medical team caring for Damar Hamlin, and also the Bills and Bengals organisations and the NFL Players Association. "After speaking with both teams and NFLPA leadership, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell informed the clubs today that the Bills-Bengals game will not be resumed this week. "The NFL has made no decision regarding the possible resumption of the game at a later date. The league has not made any changes to the week 18 regular season schedule. We will continue to provide additional information as it becomes available." The Bills released a statement around the same time, which read: "Damar Hamlin spent last night in the intensive care unit and remains there today in critical condition at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center. "We are grateful and thankful for the outpouring of support we have received thus far."
