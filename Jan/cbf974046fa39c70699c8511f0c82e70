We now have just four days remaining in the January transfer window and there is not long at all for Manchester United to bring in further reinforcements for Erik ten Hag ahead of the second half of the season. The Red Devils have already added reserve goalkeeper Jack Butland and towering forward Wout Weghorst so far this month, but supporters will no doubt be hoping for at least one or two more new faces before the window slams shut on Tuesday. United have been linked with a whole host of big names, but it seems unclear how much their unpopular Glazer owners are willing to spend. Indeed, the club may have no choice but to aim for bargains or loan deals rather than more expensive additions. Ten Hag's side are in FA Cup action this evening against Reading, but behind the scenes it would be no surprise at all if the powers-that-be are working hard on trying to secure some last-minute transfer activity. So, will we see any movement throughout the day? Follow Express Sport's live coverage of United's transfer window below...
