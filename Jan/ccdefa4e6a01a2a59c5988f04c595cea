A Budapest police officer has died following an altercation with a knifeman in Hungary's capital, local police have revealed. Budapest Police was alerted about an incident at an apartment building on Lecke Street in Ujbuda at 10.11pm (9.11pm GMT) last night.  Officers arrived after being informed that a man living at the block broke down the door to one of the neighbouring apartments and wanted to enter the premises. The man proceeded to attack the "reinforced number" of uniformed officers. He stabbed three policemen with a knife and then left the building as he headed to the street. A patrolman shot him in the leg after firing a "warning shot", the force has claimed.   Officers then arrested the assailant and he was then transferred to hospital. Staff from the National Ambulance Service arrived at the scene and also took the three stabbed police officers to hospital.
