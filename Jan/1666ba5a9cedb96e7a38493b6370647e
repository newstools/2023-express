The latest market analysis by property purchasing specialist, House Buyer Bureau, has revealed which areas of the UK have experienced the biggest house price drops since September 2022’s disastrous mini-budget. One of the worst-hit areas saw prices slashed by more than £315,000. Back in September 2022, former Chancellor of the Exchequer Kwasi Kwarteng announced his and former Prime Minister Liz Truss’s mini-budget. The budget sent the nation’s already fragile economy into meltdown, throwing the markets into disarray. Following the statement, inflation grew, interest rates increased, and many high-street mortgage providers pulled their products from the market. All these factors have contributed to the housing market stalling after two years of record growth and eye-watering house prices.

He explained: “We’ve seen house prices pushed to record highs during the pandemic and with the market now cooling, it’s no surprise that property values are heading back down to Earth. “Overall, this return to reality has been a steady one but when analysing the market at a more granular level, there are certainly some areas where property values have really fallen through the floor in the wake of September’s mini-budget. “While we don’t anticipate this rot to set in across the entirety of the market, those currently pondering a move are advised to sell their home quickly if they wish to secure anywhere close to the pandemic highs of the last two years.” The average UK house price dropped for the fourth month in a row in December, according to Halifax. December prices fell by 1.5 percent compared to the previous month with the average house price now £281,272. Halifax claimed the housing market is slowing due to the cost of living crisis and rising interest rates.
