Six people, including a baby just six-month-old, have died in a suspected gang shooting. Officers said the shooting occurred shortly after 3.30am, with two of the victims being the baby and a 17-year-old mother. Both minors were shot in the head in the horrific incident. Callers initially thought it was an active shooter situation because of how many shots were fired. When deputies arrived, they immediately noticed two victims and then a third in the doorway of the home. Deputies found six victims total at the California home, with five declared dead at the scene. They added one person was still alive but died a short time later at the hospital. Authorities believe there are at least two suspects at this time. Sheriff Mike Boudreaux, from Tulare County Sheriff's Office, said officers believe “this was very personal, and we also believe this was a message being sent.” He added the office believes narcotics and gang associations may be involved. The Tulare County Sheriff's Office said the shooting happened on Harvest Avenue between Road 68 and Kame Drive Just a week ago, a search warrant was done at the same Goshen home for drugs.
