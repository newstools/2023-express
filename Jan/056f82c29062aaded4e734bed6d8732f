 Salma Hayek, 56, was told “you look 25” after posting a new portrait to Instagram on Wednesday. While some fans tried to remember how old the actress was, others told her: “Please stop face tuning it’s getting out of hand.” The snap, which has seemingly been deleted from her page, featured Salma posing in a fluffy white robe with her dark locks pulled into a high ponytail and a light dusting of natural makeup. She simply titled the post “Good morning” in different languages, and credited her hairstylist, Jennifer Yepez, and makeup artist, Sofia Schwarzkopf, for her flawless looks. Last week, the Frida star showed off her superstar curves in a figure-hugging dress as she strutted the red carpet at the Golden Globes.
