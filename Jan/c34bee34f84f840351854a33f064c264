Leading the way in the style stakes were Lily James and Salma Hayek, who wowed in gorgeous numbers that displayed their décolletage. The Darkest Hour actress Lily James, 33, stood out in this jaw-dropping custom Atelier Versace gown, complete with dazzling De Beers jewellery. While From Dusk Till Dawn star Salma Hayek, 56, looked beautiful in her beaded, nude Gucci gown, Gucci heels, and Maison Boucheron jewellery. To celebrate not only the event being the grand 80th annual award ceremony, but also her best 'Best Performance by an Actress in a Limited Series' nomination for her role in Pam & Tommy, Lily opted for a statement hair look. The British actress debuted her dyed and chopped locks that showcased her delicate collarbone.
