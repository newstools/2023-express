Sir Michael Caine’s daughter has been banned from driving for six months, despite claiming it would affect her ability to care for her famous father. Dominique Caine, 65, admitted speeding in a Range Rover on the A436 in the Cotswolds on May 3 last year.  She was caught doing ­64mph in a 50mph zone and the minimum three penalty points imposed on her licence took her to 12, making her liable for ­a six-month ban. Defence lawyer James Findon had said: “She provides care to her father, who is based in London. If she was deprived of her ability to drive it would necessitate the use of three trains and two buses.” Ms Caine’s relationship to the actor emerged during the hearing when the judge revealed a letter of support from Sir Michael’s wife, Shakira. Ms Caine, from Cirencester, Glos, received the ban at Cheltenham magistrates’ court. She was fined £200 plus costs of £90 and a surcharge of £34.
