Adele, 34, took to the stage this weekend in Las Vegas in a figure-hugging black dress, showing off her svelte waist and gym-honed figure. The V neckline also exposed her ample assets, with the dress designer Stella McCartney wanting the dress to celebrate "curves". The gown, made from wood pulp, was covered in carefully placed crystals that beamed under the bright lights. Adele teamed it with a pair of large diamond hoop earrings and wore her blonde locks in soft waves. Stella took to Instagram to share a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the show-stopping gown, with the singer being praised by many for wearing the "forest-friendly" piece.
