Britain is likely to be hit with more cold weather, as well as wind and rain next week, according to forecasters. Weather prediction maps from WX Charts show temperatures across the nation will drop below freezing on Monday and could be as low as -7 by Wednesday. Meanwhile, On Sunday there are set to be strong winds in the north of the UK which will develop as the afternoon progresses.BBC weather forecaster Ben Rich said: "Particularly gusty conditions to the eastern side of the Pennines, around the coast of Northern Ireland and some exposed parts of the north of Scotland we will see gusts of 65mph or more with this band of rain pushing its way southwards." Meanwhile, Met Office Meteorologist Aidan McGivern said: "As we move through Sunday, winds will start to pick up, particularly across the north."Gusty conditions will develop across the Pennines in England."But the strongest winds develop across Scotland, with gales affecting the far north while a band of rain moves down Scotland."Rain in the north will clear to some wintry showers. Snow falling over the hills of northern Scotland."But more significantly, the winds will really pick up, as you see a risk of gales or severe gales further north."60mph winds are possible on Sunday night, or higher in the more exposed parts." It comes as Brits are already faxing freezing conditions this weekend, with a rare amber weather warning for cold weather having been extended for a fourth time by the UK Health Security Agency and so the level 3 alert will continue until Saturday.The UKHSA has urged Brits to look out for vulnerable and elderly neighbours over the next two days as concerns rise for those still too afraid or unable to put on their heating due to soaring energy bills.It comes after the Met Office said the UK is experiencing a sudden stratospheric warming (SSW).This is where polar winds circling high up in the stratosphere weaken and can cause cold snaps across the UK and Europe.The current event is only minor but it means that the effect on the conditions we are experiencing are more muted.During a major SSW, as the cold air from high up in the stratosphere disperses, it can affect the shape of the jet stream, which is what can cause our weather to change.However, while meteorologists can predict these SSW events, they can take weeks to influence our weather.
