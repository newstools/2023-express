A New Zealand passenger ferry issued a mayday call after losing power while on its way to Wellington. The ship had about 800 passengers on board, along with 80 crew. No casualties were reported. The Kaitaki Interislander ferry had left Picton at 2.15pm and got into difficulties after it lost propulsion power near the end of its journey.   The waters were rough and the ship was blown towards the shore, causing concern among rescuers. Tug boats were dispatched to provide assistance to the stricken ferry. Wellington regional harbourmaster Grant Nalder told the New Zealand Herald that the Kaitaki had been southwest of Sinclear Head off Wellington’s South Coast, when it lost power. He said: “They weren’t able to restore it, they were drifting, they’ve got an anchor down, and they declared a mayday." The crew were eventually able to restore the power and the ship was heading slowly towards Kaiwharawhara ferry terminal in Wellington, where it was expected to arrive shortly after 9pm local time. KiwiRail chief executive Peter Reidy said: “Tug boats have left Wellington and will be used to assist if required as Kaitaki makes her way back to the Kaiwharawhara terminal.” He added: “We are focused on ensuring the comfort and wellbeing of passengers, are keeping them updated, and will offer additional support when they arrive into Wellington.” A passenger said the Kaitaki got into trouble at around 5pm and was stranded for about one hour. They said: ”The motor’s cut out at about 5 o’clock and the captain has been updating us. We have donned the life jackets for safety reasons, just as a precaution. “Anchors have been put down and are holding and we are currently waiting I believe on some tug boats and a pilot boat to come out and assist.” Kitty Fitton, who was also travelling on the boat, said she had been terrified. She tweeted: "In the cook Strait. Ferry lost power. Dropped anchors. Terrified. Trying to stay calm."
