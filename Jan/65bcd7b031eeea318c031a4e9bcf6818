Derek Carr has posted an emotional goodbye to the Las Vegas Raiders after it emerged the franchise was looking to move on from him at the quarterback position. The Raiders are expected to make a play for either Tom Brady or Aaron Rodgers during the off-season. The Raiders benched Carr during the latter stages of the regular season, with the team already out of play-off contention. Carr was benched and removed from the depth chart, with his replacement starting instead. Now, it seems the Raiders are moving on from him completely, with the team taking the first steps towards finding a trade for him. Carr signed a three-year contract worth $121.5million back in the spring of 2022. The Raiders are expected to now prioritise a move for NFL legend Brady, who will effectively hit free agency once the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' post-season run ends. Brady will likely leave the Buccaneers, and could end up swapping coasts to join the Raiders. In his statement, Carr expressed his regret at not being able to say a proper goodbye to fans at the Allegiant Stadium, and confessed he knew the team's performances during his time there weren't good enough. "It breaks my heart I didn't get an opportunity to say goodbye in person," Carr wrote. "We certainly have been on a roller coaster in our 9 years together. "From the bottom of my heart, I am so grateful and appreciative of the years of support you gave to my family and me. We had our share of both heart breaking moments and thrilling game winning drives, and it always felt like you were there next to me. "It's especially hard to say goodbye because I can honestly say that I gave you everything I had, every single day, in season, and in the off season. It certainly wasn't perfect, but I hope that I was able to leave you with more than a few great memories as Raider fans."
