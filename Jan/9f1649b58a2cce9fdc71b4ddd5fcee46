Manchester United could still be busy in the final two weeks of the January transfer window as Erik ten Hag looks to cement his side's place in the top four. Their derby win over Manchester City has seen United move just one point behind their rivals and they're five points clear of Tottenham. Wout Weghorst and Jack Butland are the only two arrivals this window with neither yet to make an appearance. The Dutchman is expected to play as a back-up option to Anthony Martial while Butland is seen as the third-choice goalkeeper. But United continue to be linked with more moves this window, despite finances reportedly being tight. Aaron Wan-Bissaka's future remains under scrutiny and United are being linked with another right-back this window. There's also been some reports linking the club with another midfielder to help provide cover for Casemiro, who has impressed in his debut season at Old Trafford. With just under two weeks left, United look set to continue scouring the market for any more bargain deals they can find.
