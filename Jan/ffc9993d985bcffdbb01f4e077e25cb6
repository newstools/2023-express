The Critics Choice Awards returned last night for their 28th editions, with some of the best-loved names in the entertainment industry dazzling on the red carpet. Julia Roberts, 55, led a long list of best-dressed celebrities at the coveted event in a sparkling floor-length black gown with long sleeves and a sequin pattern at the neckline. Kate Hudson, 43, slipped into a floor-length Oscar de la Renta silver gown, which featured silver beading and a halter-style neckline, as well as a short tulle train. Her film Glass Onion was nominated for Best Picture and won in the categories of Best Acting Ensemble and Best Comedy. Angela Bassett, 64, who won best supporting actress for her performance in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, wore a sensational black velvet strapless dress with a peplum and ruffled tiers. Amanda Seyfried, 37, donned a gold archival Dior dress, which boasted an off-the-shoulder neckline, styled in twisted, fringed gold lamé chiffon. Amanda won best actress (limited series or movie made for television) for her performance of Elizabeth Holmes in the hit Hulu series The Dropout. Anya Taylor-Joy, 26, turned heads in a show-stopping sheer, nude dress, which she accessorised with a pair of Jimmy Choo heels and Tiffany & Co. jewels - including a ring with a diamond of over 5 carats. Jennifer Coolidge, 61, looked phenomenal in a black floor-length gown and matching gloves, which she adorned with two chunky diamond bracelets, as she posed up a storm at Fairmont Century Plaza in Los Angeles.
