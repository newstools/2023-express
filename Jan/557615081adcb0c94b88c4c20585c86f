The Australian pop/rock trio just finished up hitting sold-out stages in the UK after four years away from the country. Their set lists have been packed full of new tracks, which debuted on their third record, Beauty In Death, which was written, recorded and released during the heat of the COVID-19 pandemic on March 5, 2021. Now, they're looking to the future. Speaking exclusively to Express.co.uk, Chase Atlantic were keen to let their fans know that the future of their music is just around the corner - but they are going to have to be patient. Christian Anthony announced: "In February we're going to rent a space in Lake Tahoe and we're going to go make a new album." Of course, this is exciting news, but Chase Atlantic's fans will no doubt be looking for a definitive release date for this mystery fourth album. On this, frontman Mitchel Cave just smiled: "When it comes out... it will be the right time." Clint Cave couldn't help but drop a band secret, however. Clint laughed: "We're also sitting on, like, 20 songs!" Mitchel confirmed: "We also have like 21 songs - but that's the thing, we cull." The band reportedly began production on their third album, Beauty In Death, back in 2020. It was eventually released in March 2021. If Chase Atlantic are looking at a similar timeframe, fans may not receive the fourth record until 2024. But until any further news drops, they'll have to wait and see. Chase Atlantic return to the UK at Reading and Leeds Festivals.
