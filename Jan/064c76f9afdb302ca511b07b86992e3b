There are just nine days remaining of the January transfer window, with time running out for Premier League clubs to bolster their squads for the second half of the season. The likes of Chelsea and Arsenal have already splashed the cash, but there could be plenty more wheeling and dealing around the corner. Real Valladolid's 18-year-old right-back Ivan Fresneda is the latest name to be linked with the Gunners, while they are expected to complete a deal to sign Spezia defenderÂ Jakub Kiwior once he completed his medical tests on Sunday, with the Pole joining Leandro Trossard through the door at the Emirates. Manchester United, meanwhile, could also still be tempted by another fresh face or two having already brought in back-up goalkeeper and towering forward Wout Weghorst. Juventus' Weston McKennie is believed to be of interest, although the Red Devils may wait until the summer before swooping. The likes of Tottenham, Newcastle and Leeds may also open their wallets in the coming days, and we all know that things can move very quickly at any time. So, will we see any new movement today?
