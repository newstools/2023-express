Top Gear star Ken Block has died in a snowmobile accident at the age of 55. Block was riding on a steep slope in the US state of Utah when the snowmobile upended and landed on top of him. Wasatch County and the Sheriff’s Office said he was pronounced dead at the scene.  In a statement, Block's team, Hoonigan, said: "Ken was a visionary, a pioneer and an icon. And most importantly, a father and husband. He will be incredibly missed." The sheriff's office said in a statement: "Mr Block was riding with a group but was alone when the accident occurred. "We are saddened to hear of the loss of Kenneth and our hearts are with his family and friends so deeply affected." Block had shared pictures on Instagram on Monday morning ahead of the fatal crash. One of his photos included snowmobiles hidden in piles of snow.  He said in the caption: "This is how some mornings at my ranch in Utah look this time of year – freshly coated with snow!"
