Prince William and Kate, the Prince and Princess of Wales, "really missed a trick" by not attending the funeral of Constantine II on Monday, a royal commentator has claimed. By mingling with European royals at a highly emotional event, Kate and William would have helped dispel the "overall characterisation of the Windsor famille" Prince Harry painted in his book, titled Spare, journalist Daniela Elser said. In a comment piece for News.com.au, the commentator wrote: "The most damaging thing about Spare, if you get down to it, is not a specific incident of Palace fisticuffs or some frosty showdown in a royal garden among the topiary corgis but his overall characterisation of the Windsor famille as pathologically self-interested sorts with all the innate warmth of a freezer full of Paddle Pops. Photos from the funeral show a visibly emotional Queen Anne Marie and Crown Prince Pavlos embracing Princess Beatrix of The Netherlands (formerly the countryâ€™s Queen), King Willem-Alexander of The Netherlands, King Felipe and Queen Letizia of Spain, Prince Joachim of Denmark, among others. William and Kate being seen in this touchy, feely titled mix would have added a certain warm, humanising element to their image at exactly the moment they needed it the most. And yet instead, they were nowhere to be seen." The funeral of Constantine II, who was one of Prince William's godparents, would have been a "golden PR opportunity", Ms Elser added. By attending, she continued, Kate and William would have reminded how they do a "cracking job" at representing the UK abroad. FOLLOW THIS LIVEBLOG FOR UPDATES ON THE ROYAL FAMILY...
