A popular police dog has joined pupils in an annual school yearbook. K-9 Detective Gibbs has become the talk of the town after being enlisted in a US police force as a community outreach officer last summer.    The two-year-old golden retriever spends less time chasing leads than colleagues, instead making regular appearances at Camp Hill School District, some three miles southwest of Harrisburg in Pennsylvania. Camp Hill Police Department confirmed the pup took part in the annual yearbook photos after requests from pupils. The force said on January 26: “Thank you to the Camp Hill School District for allowing Detective Gibbs to participate in the school yearbook photos. He did a great job!” JUST IN: Sixth police officer 'relieved of duty' over Tyre Nichols beating    Describing Detective Gibbs’ work in the area, the scholarship site said: “Gibbs heads to school each day and is bringing smiles, compassion and support to all our Camp Hill students.” They added that the pup helps ease students’ anxiety and stress.
