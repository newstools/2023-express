The Prime Minister said giving strikers the rises they were demanding would lead to money being taken away from elsewhere in the NHS. But he insisted that the Government would continue to “engage in dialogue with the unions”. Earlier, he was accused of being “missing in action” during the dispute, with one union pointing to an “abdication of leadership”. Unite said Health Secretary Steve Barclay “does not have authority” to negotiate pay deals, as it urged Mr Sunak to call a meeting with unions. Today ambulance workers staged their third walkout in five weeks – as nurses and doctors plan strikes in the coming weeks. Pressed on whether there would be a point where he would have to sit down and negotiate with unions, the PM told ITV News: “Of course it would be lovely to be able to wave a magic wand and just give everyone what they were demanding when it came to pay.  “My job is to balance all of those things and do what is right for the country. That’s what we’re doing.” He was speaking as thousands of members of Unison, Unite and the GMB unions staged walkouts. Paramedics, care assistants, 999 crew and control room staff in London, Yorkshire, the North-west, North-east and South-west joined picket lines. Up to 15,000 Unison ambulance workers were on picket lines, joined by up to 5,000 of their NHS ­colleagues at two hospital trusts. Nurses and other NHS workers at the Liverpool University Hospitals Trust and the city’s Heart and Chest Hospital were also out on strike. Thousands more are due to walk out on February 6 if no deal has been reached by then – potentially the biggest day of strikes in NHS history. Speaking on LBC radio, Sharon Graham, general secretary of Unite, said of the strike plan: “There’s many, many days between now and February 6 and I hope the Government come to their senses… and do this deal. If they don’t do that, of course it will go ahead (and) it will be a very bad day for the NHS, everybody will feel that.”
