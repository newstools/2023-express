The start of the second week of the Australian Open has seen Novak Djokovic lay down a marker to his title rivals with a blowout victory over Alex de Minaur. The Aussie was tipped to be Djokovic's biggest challenge yet at the 2023 Australian Open, but he faltered on the biggest stage as the Serbian tennis star ran riot.  Djokovic wrapped things up in little over two hours, dropping just five games in the entire match. Ben Shelton's dream Grand Slam run also continued as he came from 2-1 down in sets to defeat compatriot J.J. Wolf. The young American only turned pro last summer and is competing in just his second Grand Slam tournament having made his debut at the US Open. There was another shock in the women's singles earlier in the day when Caroline Garcia was knocked out by Magda Linette. It means just three of the top 20 seeds remain in the women's draw with Aryna Sabalenka the strong favourite to win the title. Jessica Pegula will also fancy her chances, although the American faces a difficult quarter-final against Victoria Azarenka.
