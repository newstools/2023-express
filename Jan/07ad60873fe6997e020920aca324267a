Beth Mead has taken to social media to pay a heartfelt tribute to her 'kind and funny' mother June, who died earlier this month. The Arsenal and England forward also confirmed that June had died 'peacefully' last Saturday after a lengthy battle with ovarian cancer before asking for the privacy of her family to be respected at this time.    JUST IN: Ten Hag explains if Weghorst will play for Man Utd against Man City A number of tributes have been pouring in since Mead's announcement, with Arsenal boss Jonas Eidevall among those to have offered his thoughts to her family while speaking in Friday's press conference. "We heard the news and I want to send my condolences to Beth and her family," he said. "That's obviously something that has been taking a lot of energy for us as a team, to have a team-mate that goes through that. "The players have asked to play with black armbands to honour that and that's what we are going to do." Chelsea boss Emma Hayes also had some kind words for Mead and her family, telling reporters: "My condolences go to Beth Mead, more importantly as a human being, what an extremeiy tough time that person is going through. I'm thinking about her today, forget football. "She deserves that and, while her absence will be greatly missed by her team on the pitch, I think today is about her team and the football community being behind her in what is a really tough time in her life." Mead has seen her season cut short by a serious knee ligament injury but has risen to prominence for club and country as one of the world's best players over the last few years. She won both the Golden Ball and the Golden Boot as England won the Euros on home soil last year and was recently awarded an MBE in the New Year Honours list, while she also scooped the Sports Personality of the Year award last month.
