Foreign Secretary James Cleverly has been working for months to thrash out a deal over the protocol which involves agreeing on whether some EU laws will continue to be enforced in Ulster. A report in The Telegraph claims that the Prime Minister is contemplating softening the UK’s stance and giving in to Brussels in order to break the deadlock. According to the newspaper, allowing European judges to keep their role in Northern Ireland’s legal system could be enough to move negotiations forward. It would mean European judges would be able to hand down judgements and may have the final say in which EU laws apply to Northern Ireland. Such a deal is expected to be met with fierce backlash from hardline Tory Brexiteers. Though the solution would include the UK setting up an “overarching framework” to stop the European Commission from taking disputes directly to its courts, with disagreements going instead to an independent panel for review. As the anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement approaches, both sides published a joint statement calling for a deal to “protect both Northern Ireland’s place in the UK’s internal market and the integrity of the EU’s Single Market.” But the leader of the DUP, Jeffrey Donaldson, told GB News today that “there is still quite a gap to close over some very significant issues” before an agreement can be found. International figures have also joined the debate over how to solve the legal wrangling over Northern Ireland, including US President Joe Biden who is reportedly calling for the EU to be less rigid in its position. So, do you think the UK should compromise with the EU to reach an agreement over Northern Ireland? HAVE YOUR SAY RIGHT NOW - JOIN THE EXPRESS READER DEBATE IN OUR COMMENTS SECTION.
