One of the NFL's greatest players of all-time had millions believing that he had pulled the quitest retirement of all-time on Sunday evening. Los Angeles Rams defensive lineman Aaron Donald had pondered walking away from the game last year, but instead decided to stay with the team and had his contract adjusted to give him more money after dominating the league for a number of years. The three-time defensive player of the year, who many would argue could have won the award five or six teams, has a strong case for being one of the best defensive players of all-time, constantly causing disruption in the middle of the defensive line for the Rams. But after winning the Super Bowl last season, Donald had reportedly strongly considered retiring from the sport, and left it late before deciding to come back to the league with the Rams making changes to his contract. A disappointing season followed in 2022, with the Rams having a tough path to being able to compete once again, having no first-round draft pick this year and limited cap space to put pieces around Donald to continue to build their team. And during this weekend's games, Donald made a change to his social media platform, naming himself a 'formerÂ Rams D lineman'. This lead multiple outlets and fans wondering if he had decided to retire from the sport - in what would be a typically quiet way to do so from a man who fans usually don't hear too much from, with the 31-year-old doing his talking on the field. But Donald quickly put those worries to rest, when he made another change, removing the word former - indicating he potentially made a mistake when making changes to his bio. Still playing at an elite level despite the Rams struggling in 2022, Donald looks to be all-in for next season, along with his head coach Sean McVay. It was heavily suggested that the coach could be about to walk away from coaching in order to take a television job, but has since committed to remaining in Los Angeles as the coach.
