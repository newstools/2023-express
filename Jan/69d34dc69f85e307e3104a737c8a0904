Carol Vorderman, whose Perfect 10 podcast premieres today, stirred up some enthusiasm among followers as she made an appearance in a pair of tight black leather leggings and a neon orange Karen Millen top. Once the highest paid woman on British television, the 62-year-old ex-Countdown star is now launching a new quiz show - and her accompanying video to promote it sent her followers into a frenzy. "Wiggling with joy for @perfect10carol," she exclaimed in view of her 290,000 followers, as the presenter shook her bottom for the camera wearing very tight jeans, giving fans an eyeful of her famous curves. "10 questions, 10 answers, all done in 10 minutes. Join me with a different quiz every day Monday To Friday," she continued in the caption. Urging followers to give it a try during their coffee breaks or morning commutes, she challenged them to try their best to achieve a "perfect 10" - exactly the score her devotees had for her after watching her latest clip.
