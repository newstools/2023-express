TikTok faces being banned across the US by a new bill. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, tabled a new law which would ban the massively popular social media app across America. The senator has cited national security fears as the reason for tabling the bill. Hawley said TikTok is “China's backdoor into Americans' lives” on Twitter. “It threatens our children's privacy as well as their mental health”, he added. “Last month Congress banned it on all government devices. Now I will introduce legislation to ban it nationwide." The Senator then explained to reporters his bill specifically bans TikTok, and “doesn’t ban any other app, but it also requires a comprehensive report to Congress on the national security threat”. According to TikTok, there are an estimated 80 million active users in the US alone. TikTok denies the allegations from the Senator, calling Hawley’s proposed ban a “piecemeal” approach to national security. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, has poured cold water on the Republican’s bill, saying a nationwide ban wouldn’t solve the overarching problem. “It’s TikTok today … who knows what it will be tomorrow,” he said. “We need an approach that says we’re going to look at foreign-based technology.” READ MORE: Tributes pour in for two children allegedly strangled to death by mum FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr also warned against banning more apps than just TikTok, but backed blocking the social media giant. “We know enough to take immediate near-term action on TikTok while then we then continue to have discussions on how do we put broader protections in place,” he said. “We just had news break a couple weeks ago that TikTok officials inside China were using the application surveil the location of US reporters.” Late in December, Catherine L. Szpindor, the chief administrative officer of the House, ordered lawmakers and staffers to delete TikTok from any House-issued mobile phones and prohibited them from downloading it on such devices. Also that month, the $1.7 trillion omnibus spending bill included a measure banning the app and other applications by ByteDance on all executive branch devices.

ByteDance agreed at the time to divest the app to prevent a ban, before TikTok later announced plans to file legal action challenging the order. After Joe Biden became President, he signed an executive order revoking the Trump administration's ban on TikTok, and instead ordered the Secretary of Commerce to investigate the app to determine if it poses a threat to US national security.
