Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag has just six days left of the January transfer window to ready his squad for the remainder of the season. The Red Devils are in a rich vein of form under the Dutchman and may look to capitalise on their recent success by bringing in reinforcements. United's transfer business this month has been modest, with loan deals sewn up for goalkeeper Jack Butland and rangy forward Wout Weghorst after a lucrative summer blowout that saw Ten Hag go significantly over-budget. It is rumoured that another arrival could be in the pipeline, but much of the Red Devils' next few days will also surround thinning out the squad so that a selection of promising youngsters can temporarily fly the nest and earn more game time. Some of them got a run-out in United's 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday evening, and it remains to be seen whether their respective performances will influence Ten Hag's decision.
