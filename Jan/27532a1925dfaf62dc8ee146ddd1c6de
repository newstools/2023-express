David Garcia Thomas, 28, fainted during the evening rush hour at “rammed” Oxford Circus station in November 2019, becoming trapped between the train and the platform edge. He suffered a fractured spine, fractured pelvis, and serious leg injuries after being dragged along for some distance in front of commuters, court papers say. Mr Garcia Thomas, of Balham, south London, is now suing TfL, claiming it “failed to identify all the risks to the safety of customers caused by overcrowded and congested platforms”. He also said the platform should have had a “platform edge device to prevent falls”. Documents lodged with London’s High Court by his lawyers state: “At Oxford Circus, he crossed to the ­platform for the southbound Victoria Line. The platform was extremely crowded. “He was hot and nauseous and began to feel dizzy and light-headed. “He was concerned that he might faint so he turned around, intending to move further away from the platform edge. “However, the platform was so crowded and congested that he was unable to move. The claimant has no recollection of what happened next. CCTV footage ­confirms the claimant suffered a medical episode, causing him to collapse and fall from the platform into the path of an oncoming train. “The claimant was struck by the train. He was removed by emergency services and taken to hospital.” His lawyers go on to claim that TfL had not undertaken an adequate risk assessment and did not do enough to manage or prevent overcrowding. The documents say IT executive Mr Garcia Thomas needed seven operations and spent four months on crutches afterwards. TfL’s defence to the action was not available from the court.
