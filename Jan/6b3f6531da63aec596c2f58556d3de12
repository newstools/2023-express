King Charles, Princess Anne and the Prince and Princess of Wales have all come out in force this week. Senior members of the Royal Family appeared unfazed by the allegations and criticism levelled at the Firm by Prince Harry in his recent interviews and book, titled Spare. Princess Anne has been busy this week as she undertook an official visit to Cyprus, during which she met the nation's president Nicos Anastasiades as well as British soldiers serving there with the UN peacekeeping force. King Charles, who over the weekend had been seen attending the Sunday service in Scotland, carried out today his first-ever official engagement of the year. The head of state headed to Aboyne and Mid Deeside Community Shed in Aberdeenshire, a community hub offering a wide range of services. He also met representatives from local charities, including a food bank, and appeared in a very good mood as he stopped to chat with some residents and royal fans. Kate and Prince William also signalled it is very much business as usual for the Firm as they headed to Merseyside to meet mental and physical health professionals as well as for a tour of the new hospital in Liverpool. Upon their arrival at the hospital, the Prince and Princess of Wales waved and smiled at royal well-wishers, who gathered to show their support to the heir to the throne and his wife.
