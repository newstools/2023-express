Abbey Clancy, 36, and Peter Crouch, 41, proved that they are still in love after 16 years together as the model shared a loved-up snap on social media. Abbey took to her Instagram Story to post a picture cuddling up to the former footballer as they soaked up the sun on the beach. The pair looked relaxed as they enjoyed their tropical holiday, lounging on sun beds with their sunglasses on after renewing their vows in the Maldives on December 17. The pair, who share kids Sophia, 11, Liberty, seven, Johnny, five, and three-year-old Jack, wed back in 2011 at the Stapleford Park hotel in Leicestershire. Peter and Abbey’s vow renewal ceremony took place under an arch of white roses similar to that of their original wedding day.
