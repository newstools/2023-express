A power cut in Wolverhampton left thousands in darkness on Tuesday night, and also impacted Wolves FC's home ground Molineux as they took on Liverpool in the FA Cup. The game was barely a minute in when Wolves' Adama Traore burst down the right-hand side, powered in a cross, only to see the floodlights suddenly turn off. The BBC's coverage and the VAR refereeing system were also impacted, according to the BBC's commentary team. Another area of the Midlands, Walsall, was also impacted as National Grid look into what caused the problem.   Footage from a pub in Wolverhampton showed how the nearby area was also being impacted. North Street Social tweeted just after 7pm: "Trialling a new concept tonight due to the COLC… drinking in darkness." A spokesperson for the National Grid replied: "Apologies, we are aware of a fault affecting #Walsall #Wolverhampton and are estimating to have the power restored by 20:00. We are currently fault switching to try and restore you sooner so you may see some brief interruptions whilst we carry this out." A spokesperson for National Grid said: "We are aware of a fault affecting Walsall and Wolverhampton and are estimating to have the power restored by 8pm. "We are currently fault-switching to try and restore you sooner so you may see some brief interruptions whilst we carry this out."
