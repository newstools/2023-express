A mother who has said she is "addicted" to getting tattoos has revealed she is unable to land a job due to her extreme inkings. However, this doesn't stop the daredevil mum-of-two from getting tatted up consistently. Melissa Sloan, 45, has tattoos all over her body, as well as bold designs with flowers and an England flag on her face. She said that her inkings are mainly done "prison style" by her boyfriend at home. She has a big Kray twins piece inked on her leg, one dedicated to Playboy bunnies, and cartoon marijuana leaves on her head. The mum from Wales said the collection continues to grow. Melissa told the Daily Star: "I have three tattoos a week. It's like when you have a fag or a drink, you get addicted. "I can't stop it now, it's addictive, for me anyway. I just can't stop it. "I carry the [tattoo] gun around with me in the boot, I'll get one in the car or anywhere. "My boyfriend does them, he does my tattoos prison style." Melissa said that her love of tattoos has had an impact on her life as she gets funny looks and struggles to hold down a job because of her extensive inkings. She continued: "I can't get a job. They won't have me. I applied for a job cleaning toilets where I live and they won’t have me because of my tattoos. "The first job I had was cleaning ages ago, cleaning toilets. People have said I have never had a job in my life, I have had one once and it didn't last long. "But, if someone offered me a job tomorrow I would go and work – I would take that offer. "I expected this in life, I can't fit in with people as I like to be me and I'm always going to be myself. "They don't have to listen to me. But I'm not going anywhere."
