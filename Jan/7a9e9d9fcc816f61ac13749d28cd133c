Stacey Solomon, 33, looked ecstatic as her husband Joe Swash placed a protective hand over her bump and planted a kiss on her cheek as she prepares to give birth for the fifth time. The overjoyed Loose Women star had thought her one-year-old daughter Rose would be her last - but last year, a pregnancy test revealed they were in for an unexpected surprise. Meanwhile, Joe is marking a milestone - his 41st birthday - which Stacey acknowledged in a gushing caption shared with over five million followers.  The post received almost 300,000 likes in a matter of hours, as fans marvelled at the ever-growing bump making its presence known, while Stacey posed in a brown bodycon dress.
