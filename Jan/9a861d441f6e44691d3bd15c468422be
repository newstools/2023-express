Phil Tufnell, 56, shared the images with his 351,000 Twitter followers and captioned the tweet with a witty pun about his hair transplant.   The former I’m A Celebrity…Get Me Out of Here! star said of his “lunch hour” surgery: “I have been suffering from hair loss for a few years at the back and sides of my scalp and I wanted to do something about it.” The sportsman realised he needed help with his hair when he spotted it was thinning in the overhead mirrors in a lift at the BBC in London.

I am going to need a patch-up on my barnet.’ “There are modern techniques to address the problem, so why not get it done? I knew I would feel a whole lot better afterwards.” Phil continued: “No one likes to lose their hair and I don’t think the shape of my face is suited to a receding hairline. But my main reason is that I wanted a nice head of hair." Phil admitted that he started to lose his hair seven years ago and was worried that it was starting to become noticeable. He said: “What worried me was the thinning hair at the front of my hair which is most noticeable when I am on TV. The Strictly Come Dancing star added: “I am aware that several ex-cricketers have had help with their hair. We are like a little club of hair transplant patients. “The common factor in all of us is that we are all on the TV and in the media and are aware that we need to look good when we are presenting to millions of fans.” Phil’s hair transplant reportedly cost him £4,000 and comes two years after the Question of Sport captain was diagnosed with skin cancer.

He explained: “I try to always wear sunscreen now and I’m careful about how much I stay in the sun.” There are three major types of skin cancer — basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma. As the NHS explains, the most common types of skin cancer fall under the category of non-melanoma. Non-melanoma skin cancer refers to a group of cancers that slowly develop in the upper layers of the skin. The term non-melanoma distinguishes these more common types of skin cancer from the less common skin cancer known as melanoma, which can be more serious.
