Lily Allen, 37, stunned fans as she ditched her signature black hair for a blonde bob in her latest social media post. The Not Fair singer took to her Instagram Story to share her new hairstyle, which featured a side fringe, with her 1.5 million followers. She uploaded a selfie wearing a black roll neck knitted jumper, letting her short, blonde locks take centre stage. Along with the snap, Lily wrote “Hai,” while a second post gave fans a closer look at the other side of the singer’s head as she smiled in a selfie. Back in December, Lily shared a series of posts featuring a very short bob, in her signature dark colour.
