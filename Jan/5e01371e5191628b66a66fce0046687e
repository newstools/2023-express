Payments for the support will increase by 10.1 percent in April with the start of the new tax year. Other benefits are also increasing by this amount including Universal Credit and Pension Credit. At present, claimants receive £21.80 a week for their eldest child and £14.45 a week for any additional children. With the increase, payments for the first child will go up to £24 a week while payments for additional children will increase to £15.90 a week. Over the course of a year, this means payments for the eldest child will increase from £1,113.60 to £1,248. Payments for additional children will go up from £751.40 a year to £826.80, providing a welcome boost as everyday costs continue to rise.

An individual may also be able to claim the allowance if one of the parents of the child is still alive. The payment for this is £18.55 a week and this will also increase by 10.1 percent in April, rising to £20.40 a week. Those eligible for the extra support will receive £1,060.80 over the course of a year, an increase of £96.20. Those who claim Child Benefit may have to pay back part of their payment or even the entire amount if they earn over a certain amount. Individuals who earn more than £50,000 could be hit by the High Income Child Benefit tax Charge (HICBC) and the threshold for this has not changed since it was introduced in January 2013. People who earn more than £60,000 will have to pay back their Child Benefit claim in its entirety. The tax charge may apply if a claimant or their partner individually earns more than £50,000.

Wealth management group Royal London warned the tax charge may put people off claiming the support, which means people miss out on the potential benefits for their state pension, if there is a non-working parent. Claimants with children under 12 may be able to get National Insurance credits (NI) to cover any gaps where they are not paying contributions while caring for the child. A year of NI credits will cover the same amount of contributions as would be paid if a person was working and paying into the system, which goes towards their state pension. An individual typically needs 35 years of National Insurance contributions to claim the new full state pension, which is currently £185.15 a week. If a person misses just one year of contributions, this would mean they lose out on around £275 a year in their state pension payments, or £5,500 over a typical 22 year retirement. State pension payments for both the basic state pension and the new state pension are also increasing by 10.1 percent in April. The full new state pension is increasing to £203.85 a week while the full basic state pension is going up from £141.85 a week to £156.20 a week.
