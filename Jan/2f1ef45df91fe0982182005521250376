Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce told the Cincinnati Mayor to "Shut his damn mouth" after the Chiefs defeated the Bengals in the AFC Championship game to book a slot in the Super Bowl. There had been a fair deal of trash talk from the Bengals in the build-up to Sunday's highly-anticipated Championship game. The Bengals visited Arrowhead for the second straight year, having come out on top last time out. Ahead of the rematch, the Cincinnati Mayor had attempted to get inside Mahomes' head by releasing a video message getting the verbal beef going. He joked in the video that - due to Joe Burrow's 3-0 record against Mahomes going into Sunday's game - Arrowhead Stadium should be renamed 'Burrowhead'. He also quipped that Burrow should take a paternity test to prove he's not Mahomes' father. His words certainly got the Chiefs fired up for Sunday's game, as Kelce took the time to call him out after the win. Speaking to the NFL Network, he said: "I appreciate this. How about this beautiful trophy? "I've got some wise words for that Cincinnati mayor. Know your role and shut your mouth, you jabroni! You've got to fight for your right to party!" Mahomes also took the time to respond to the 'Burrowhead' jokes in his post-game interview directly after the win. He said: "This team stepped up against a great football team, we showed that this place is still Arrowhead, it's not Burrowhead anymore." The Chiefs will now face the Philadelphia Eagles in the Super Bowl on February 12 in Arizona. The Eagles defeated the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Championship game in a one-sided beatdown in which 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy suffered an elbow injury.
