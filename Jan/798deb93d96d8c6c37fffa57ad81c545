Classic cars under a price of £50,000 have been revealed to be the most profitable investment when compared to property, gold and stocks. New data has found that more affordable classic cars made a 70 percent return on investment, on average, between 2019 and 2022. But some classic cars could see owners pocketing more than they first anticipated. Research shows that investing in a Ferrari F355 pre-pandemic would see a whopping 214 percent return on your investment now, on average. Confused.com, which commissioned the data, compared classic cars with other popular investments, including the housing market, the FTSE100 and gold.

Louise Thomas added: “When you also then consider the added necessities, such as maintenance costs and classic car insurance, it can add up substantially over time. “These extra costs can become expensive, particularly when classic cars can be harder to repair or replace. “This can also have a knock-on effect on the price you pay for car insurance, so it’s always worth shopping around to keep your costs down. “If you're thinking about investing in a classic car or you already own one, insurance for your classic car is a great way to protect your assets for the future.” The Citroën 2CV is a classic vehicle which is not in short supply, with 380,000 still on the market, yet still attracts more than three-quarters of a million searches every year.
