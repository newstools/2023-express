A teacher was left confused after meeting twins whose parents had named them almost identical names. The substitute teacher had to make an extra effort to differentiate identical twins in their class after they learned the sisters share similar names. The teacher slammed their parents' "ridiculous" name choice online after struggling to know who was who in the classroom. In the post on Reddit, the teacher revealed they have twins named Selene and Selina in their class, before asking: "Anyone else ever come across an equally ridiculous sib set?" However, the comments suggested it is quite common for parents to give twins similar-sounding names, reports the Mirror.  While it was not clear if all responders liked the names they shared, several did debate the merits of similar monikers.  "I know twins with the same name same spelling, no joke. Both Leonardo. "She loved the name and had it picked out and had SURPRISE twins… just rolled with the same name still. Different middle names and mercifully the second at least goes by the middle name but what. Logistical nightmare. "She is the loveliest and best neighbour but that part about her (grown) twin boys is a head-scratcher for sure lol," someone wrote. Another said: "As a twin mom, names like these make my teeth itch."
