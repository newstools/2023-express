Gemma Albrow, 41, found the silver piece 34 years ago in her parents’ jewellery shop, noticing it was inscribed with the surname Hand. Then, while scrolling through social media recently, she noticed a mention of the same name and got in touch. Gemma, from Seaford, East Sussex, said: “I’m overjoyed. I never in a million years thought I’d find them. It was such a shock when I saw the name. It’s incredible for me that it’s going home and they will cherish it as I did.” Gemma had always been intrigued by the ring’s inscription. It featured the names Vincent and Walter Hand, and their birth and death dates, showing Vincent died just months after his father Walter – aged only two. After doing some digging online, she found the ring had belonged to a Hannah Hand. Gemma was then on Facebook when she saw the name Hand in a group about her hometown, Leek in Staffordshire. She contacted the post’s author, Darren Gerrard, and discovered he’s married to Susan Gerrard - the great-great-granddaughter of Hannah Hand. Hannah married Walter and Clement, their youngest child, is Susan’s great-grandfather. Vincent was also their child, but died of tuberculosis shortly after the same illness claimed his father, with Hannah also succumbing to it a year later. Susan said: “Their three remaining children were raised by uncle Harold Hand on a family farm.”
