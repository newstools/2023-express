The mother of two is calling on ministers to bring in "practical solutions" like intensive summer holiday courses for primary school pupils. Sharron, 60, spoke out after a Sport England survey found only 72 percent of youngsters in their first year of secondary school could complete a length (25 metres) of a standard recreational pool - six per cent down on pre-Covid numbers. Four in 10 primary schools offer no swimming lessons, despite it being a National Curriculum requirement. Meanwhile, public and private pools are struggling to stay open because of rising energy costs. Sharron, who started her swimming career at the age of 11 and won a silver medal at the 1980 Moscow games, said: "I believe wholeheartedly that all children should be given the opportunity to swim. "It's a life skill, it's something you can do from the cradle to the grave. You can do it if you are pregnant, if you are disabled, and in the later years of life." The Daily Express launched a Save Our Public Pools crusade after 60 had shut down in the past three years. And Swim England warned recently that 300 face closure because of soaring costs. Sharron said: "We had a problem with this before Covid - and then Covid came along and closed all the pools. Lots of swimming teachers left the occupation, and now we've got the heating expense problem."
