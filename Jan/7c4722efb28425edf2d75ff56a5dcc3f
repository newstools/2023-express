Novak Djokovic's worrying fall in the second set of the Australian Open set even had umpire Louise Engzell concerned for the tennis icon. Djokovic was dominating Stefanos Tsitsipas from the very first service game in the men's final on Sunday.  He quickly raced to a one-set lead, but Tsitsipas had shown some signs that he was beginning to find his rhythm. The No 4 seed soon began to trouble Djokovic with the Serbian cutting a frustrated figure at times in the second set as he struggled to find a breakthrough. With the set finely poised, Djokovic had worked his way to a mini break with Tsitsipas serving at 3-3. But the Greek was composed as he worked Djokovic around the baseline with the former world No 1 eventually losing his footing on a difficult backhand. Djokovic ended up taking a nasty tumble and looked in some discomfort as he gingerly got back to his feet. He appeared to be stretching out his left leg as he walked over to his towel and needed some time before getting back in position to continue the game.  Chair umpire Engzell could be heard asking Djokovic: "You okay Novak?" Djokovic was able to continue soon after, but he appeared rattled as Tsitsipas went on to hold serve. The atmosphere began growing in support of Tsitsipas with the Greek star ramping up the crowd.  The main concern from Djokovic's tumble was whether it had aggravated his hamstring injury. He has had his left leg heavily strapped throughout the tournament, although he raised eyebrows for the final with that taping drastically reduced. But Courier doesn't think the fall would have any serious effect on Djokovic. "I think he rolled with it, that fall. I don't know if he really rolled the ankle or not," Jim Courier said for Channel Nine. "We will take a good look here ... just sort of stuck and tripped on the edges of the shoe."
