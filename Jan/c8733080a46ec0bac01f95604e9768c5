It’s the Manchester derby at 12.30pm on Saturday. A win for Manchester City would see them close the gap on leaders Arsenal to two points. The Gunners play their north London rivals Spurs on Sunday. You can get EVS (was 1/33) on a goal to be scored at Old Trafford with William Hill’s Epic Odds promotion.  The pick of Saturday’s racing comes from Warwick, which hosts a couple of Grade 2s, as well as the Classic Chase at 3pm. There could be Cheltenham Festival clues in that one. You can also catch Grade 2 action at Kempton, with the Silviniaco Conti Chase at 2.05pm, before the competitive Lanzarote Hurdle at 2.40pm.
