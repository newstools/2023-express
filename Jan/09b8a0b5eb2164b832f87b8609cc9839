F1 star Lewis Hamilton once felt the wrath of Stevenage residents after referring to the 'slums' of his home town. The Mercedes driver made the comment in 2018 after winning his fifth world title - leaving locals of the Hertfordshire town unimpressed by the comment.  Despite being crowned world champion in 2018, the Mercedes star finished second in the BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards behind Tour de France winner Geraint Thomas. During the show Hamilton was interviewed about receiving the prestigious nomination by presenter Gabby Logan. "It's been a really long journey, a dream for us all, as a family, to do something different, to get out of the slums," said Hamilton who then backtracked on his comment. "Well, we would say it's not the slums, but just come out from somewhere and do something. We all set our goals very high but we did it as a team." Hamilton was born and raised in the English town, which sits 27 miles north of London, and started his go-karting career there aged six.
