The star, 46, who came sixth with Italian pro Graziano di Palma, said: "I learned new skills, new things about myself, lost a fair bit of weight and met some amazing people.  "I never saw myself as someone up there with the best dancers but the whole experience taught me to give myself more credit." Kym, a mum of four and gran of two, added: "There were times on set where my anxiety reared its head and threatened to take hold.  "I was nervous but I discovered I could beat and take control. That's the lesson I'll cherish most." In 2021 the ex-Corrie actress spoke about crippling anxiety attacks that stopped her hosting BBC show Morning Live.  They came after her dad Dave was diagnosed with prostate cancer. Kym - married to Army Major Scott Ratcliff, 34, has since returned to the job. She told Prima: "I want to keep testing limits and proving my capabilities."
