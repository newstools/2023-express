Holly Willoughby, 41, has become a household name over the years thanks to her numerous TV appearances and being one half of one of British TV's most recognisable presenting duos alongside Phillip Schofield. However, the This Morning presenter looked entirely different at the beginning of her career as she sported a fringe and darker hair. In unearthed pictures from 2004, Holly could be seen timidly posing for the cameras as she attended the UK premiere of Sky Captain & The World Of Tomorrow at the Empire, Leicester Square. The veteran TV star smiled as she modelled her outfit, which consisted of a black off-the-shoulder blouse and matching long skirt. Holly accessorised the look with red heels and a matching patent clutch bag, which also matched her glossy lipstick.
