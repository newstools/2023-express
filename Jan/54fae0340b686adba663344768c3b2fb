Manchester United have been active in the early stages of the transfer market, with Erik ten Hag offloading players from his squad rather than recruiting. However, the Red Devils are in the market for a new addition this month as the Premier League top-four race heats up. United’s main focus in the winter transfer window is acquiring a striker capable of replacing Cristiano Ronaldo. That said, amid intense speculation over an impending takeover at Old Trafford, the Glazers are said to be only willing to sanction a loan deal. Cristiano Ronaldo endured a toxic end to his United career ahead of his November release, but he could have opened the door to deliver a parting gift after completing his move to Al-Nassr. Meanwhile, a £66million-rated striker is also said to be ‘keen’ on a move to the Red Devils midway through the season. Harry Maguire has also been backed to leave M16 after settling into the role of security substitute under Ten Hag this season. Express Sport provides all the latest United transfer news and gossip on the second day of the January transfer window.
