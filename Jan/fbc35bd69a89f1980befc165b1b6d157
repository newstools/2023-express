Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt is set to approve a support package for British steel and Tata Steel UK with funding worth over £500million. It is hoped that the injection of cash will help prevent thousands of people from losing their jobs. British Steel had requested £300million in support as the company braced for the closure of its blast furnace in Scunthorpe. As reported by the Financial Times, Tata Steel UK, based in Port Talbot Wales, will also receive a large sum in support funding. The cash will be used to help the company introduce green furnaces at its operations, Government sources claimed. Around 3,500 workers are employed at the Port Talbot facility, while Tata has around 8,000 staff in total. The company said last year that its operations in the UK would come to a stop if it did not receive funding. The decarbonising process in the steel industry is an expensive one, with industry insiders reportedly estimating that this would cost £2billion at the Port Talbot facility alone. British steelmakers are feeling the pressure as energy prices soar, inflation persists, and demand dwindles amid recession fears. These factors combined with pressure to invest in more environmentally friendly production have left companies reeling. Liberty Steel has cut its production and mothballed some of its sites, putting more than 400 jobs at risk. The company's owner, Sanjeev Gupta, blamed this on high energy costs. Jingye and Tata Steel, owned by Indian conglomerate Tata, will have make promises regarding investment and the protection of jobs up until 2030 in return for Government support.
