Rising costs for everyday needs including food and energy over the past 12 months have affected families across the UK. More Government support is on the way to help out those affected most by the squeeze. Below is a list of the key dates throughout the year that people may want to take note of, with details of when payments will arrive in their bank accounts or when benefits and the state pension will increase. All UK households with a domestic energy supply are receiving a £400 energy bill discount, being paid in six instalments. People received £66 in October and in November, with £67 instalments from December to March next year. The Winter Fuel Payment is a payment of between £250 and £600 set to arrive in eligible people’s bank accounts this month if it hasn't already. The amount a person receives depends on a person’s household circumstances. The payment is not taxable and will not affect a person’s benefits. To be eligible, a person must have been born before September 26, 1956 and in most cases be a UK resident - there are some exceptions. This year the payment includes a ‘Pensioner Cost of Living Payment’, worth between £150 and £300. Payments are due to arrive before January 13, 2023, with no specific payment windows confirmed yet.

There will also be a £150 payment for disabled Britons during Summer 2023 and a £300 payment to pensioners in Winter 2023 or early 2024. The exact dates for these payments have yet to be set out by the Government. The CPI inflation figure for inflation is important as benefits increase each year in line with this figure, including Universal Credit and Pension Credit. With inflation expected to remain high this year, claimants could get a sizeable increase in payments again. The state pension also increases each year, under the triple lock policy, in line with the highest of 2.5 percent, the rise in average earnings or the rate of inflation.
