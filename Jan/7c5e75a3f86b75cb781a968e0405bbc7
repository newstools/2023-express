Madonna, 64, is the talk of music today as she announced her Celebration Tour, with the singer doing 35 concerts around the world. Nile Rodgers, 70, solely produced Madonna's 1984 hit Like a Virgin, with the musician recalling their first meeting exclusively to Express.co.uk. Express.co.uk asked Nile how Like a Virgin came about, with the musician recalling their first meeting in a club. When the pair met Madonna was in a relationship with DJ JellyBean Benitez, Nile's friend and also the producer of Madonna's first album. Nile recalled: "I was going to see another artist entirely and Madonna happened to be the other artist's opening act. "I knew of Madonna because her boyfriend at the time was a DJ named Jellybean Benitez and I knew Jellybean.

"When he came out, I was like 'wow, that's Jellybean's girlfriend, holy cow'." Nile then remembered going backstage to speak with Madonna, with the singer then asking Nile for his help. He continued: "So I went backstage and started talking to her and according to Madonna she made her mind up right there on the spot that I was the guy she wanted to work with just from that chance meeting. "Madonna was just starting and there's a photograph of me and Madonna at a Duran Duran concert at Madison Square Garden. "We're just sitting in the audience, nobody knew who she was. "But you won't believe this, just a few months later she was headlining at Madison Square Garden."

He chats to the creatives about making it in music and how itâ€™s changed over the years thanks to advances in smartphone technology, platforms like TikTok and opportunities like StemDrop. Speaking on the project, Nile said: "I think it's great, any form of reaching the public to me is fantastic. "It's easy to think about the possible negative stuff, but I'm not really like that. I always try to look at the positive. "An artist can reach anybody out there, it's amazing. It's an amazing gift to me, that's what we live for."
