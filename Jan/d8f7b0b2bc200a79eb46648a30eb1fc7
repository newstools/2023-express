 Britons have been advised to wear face masks if they are feeling unwell to help stop the spread of flu and Covid this winter. NHS leaders have warned that the nation is facing a “twindemic” of infections adding more pressure to the NHS already struggling with strep A infections, backlogs and worker strikes. So would you support a return to social distancing and face masks? Vote in our poll.  The new advice is part of an attempt to curb the rise of hospitalisations. The President Society for Acute Medicine, Dr Tim Cooksley said “urgent action” is needed to rescue the health service. He told Sky News: “This situation is much worse than we experienced under the Covid pandemic at its peak.” Professor Susan Hopkins, the chief medical adviser at the UK Health Security Agency, also recommended that children should stay at home. She said: “If your child is unwell and has a fever, they should stay home from school or nursery until they feel better and the fever has resolved. Adults should also try to stay home when unwell and if you do have to go out, wear a face covering.” READ MORE: Covid face mask sees return to ‘control and compliance’ GB News presenter Mark Dolan criticised the potential return of face coverings, describing them as “muzzles” that will “open the door to future medical tyranny”. He said: “Surely three years after the arrival of Covid we are not still flogging these filthy wretched muzzles, are we? Have we really got to go through all of this again? “Face masks are environmentally catastrophic, non-recyclable with billions now discarded making their way into the sea and slowly threatening the food chain. Well done everyone. They impede economic activity, human interaction they affect education.” So what do YOU think? Would you support a return to social distancing and masks?
