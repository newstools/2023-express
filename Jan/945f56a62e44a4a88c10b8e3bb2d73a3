The Carabao Cup is reaching its crescendo with both Manchester United and Newcastle clinching their spots in the semi-final draw on Tuesday evening. Manchester City are hoping to continue their terrific record in the competition as they face Southampton this evening while Nottingham Forest and Wolves battle it out for history. The other two ties were played on Wednesday night with City facing Southampton and Nottingham Forest taking on Wolves. Pep Guardiola made a number of changes to his usual starting line-up with the likes of Erling Haaland, Kevin De Bruyne and Ederson all dropping to the bench. But City still had a strong starting XI with Jack Grealish, Phil Foden, Ilkay Gundogan, Kalvin Phillips, Kyle Walker and Joao Cancelo all included from the off. Guardiola has become a Carabao Cup specialist since arriving at the Etihad, but his team were all sea against Southampton as the south coast side ran out surprise 2-0 winners. Dean Henderson was the hero on the night for Forest as well as he came to their rescue in the penalty shoot-out against Wolves. Manchester United have now been drawn to face Forest in the semi-final with Southampotn taking on Newcastle in the other tie.
