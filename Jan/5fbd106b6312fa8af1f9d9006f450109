Now, step forward Alex Edelman, who can justly inherit the mantle of his illustrious predecessors. At 33, Edelman already has a reputation for brilliant comedy scripts, and his shows at the Edinburgh Festival and on Broadway are sell-outs. It is easy to see why in this rapid-fire 90-minute show in which he throws elements of personal history and anecdotes into the story of how he attended a meeting of white supremacists in Queens NY and lived to tell the tale. With nothing more than a few stools as props, he talks and moves incessantly, tossing out observations like comic firecrackers: “Radio comedy is like a podcast for the dying”; “I grew up in a really racist part of Boston… called Boston” – deviating without hesitation into comic byways, before bringing us back to that roomful of racists and anti-semites into which he’d wandered accidentally on purpose. His engagement with the audience is exemplary, turning self-effacement into an art form, particularly in his ill-considered wooing of the lovely Aryan Chelsea, the only girl at the meeting. He adopts the quiet/loud approach favoured by post-punk rock groups such as Nirvana and Pixies that keep us on full alert. By the end, I had to check my ribcage for intercostal damage.
