Manchester United's search for a striker in the January transfer window rolls on for another day, but they continued to be linked with moves. Finances are said to be tight at the club and it's been reported that they will likely look for a loan move. They've not been lacking in goals since the season resumed after the World Cup, scoring three in as all-but-one of their matches so far with Marcus Rashford finding the net in all four. But they're yet to face any team outside the bottom 15 and their biggest test will come next weekend against arch-rivals Manchester City. By that point, United may well have made their move in the January transfer window for a striker. Joao Felix continues to be linked with the likes of Memphis Depay, Vincent Aboubakar and Mohammed Kudus are among several other supposed targets. The Atletico Madrid forward appears to be the most viable option with Felix available to leave on loan this month. However, United appear willing to wait until the end of the month to strike any deal.
