Not cleaning your vacuum thoroughly means it won't suck up dust and dirt and you will need to replace it sooner. The cleaning expert asked homeowners: "When was the last time you cleaned your vacuum's filter?" While many might forget to clean this part of the hoover, it is actually essential to keeping your vacuum running properly and cleaning your home effectively. Melissa explained: "If it's filthy, it can't suction property and can tax the motor. Cleaning it takes seconds to do." She went on: "The grossest part of your vacuum by far is the filter and it's so easy to forget to clean. But once you rinse it and allow it to dry, your vacuum won't be taxed anymore and it can pick up all of those fine particles that it's supposed to."
