Former Miss Croatia winner Ivana Knoll has caught the attention of sports fans yet again after being present at an NBA game on Sunday night. Knoll rose to fame after appearing at a number of games at the World Cup in Qatar, where she was pictured by photographers in the stands, and even the game cameras panning to her at times. Since then, she has gained 3.5 million followers on Instagram, and been pictured with Canadian rapper Drake and American actor Jamie Foxx, while also appearing on Piers Morgan's Uncensored show - where she defended her right to wear what she likes. Currently enjoying time in the United States, Knoll was pictured at an NBA game between the Miami Heat and Brooklyn Nets in south Florida. Knoll saw the Nets defeat the Heat in a close-fought game, wearing black and red Heat jersey with superstar Jimmy Butler on the back. She had also worn tight red trousers, with some joking that the referees were paying attention to her and not on the game. On her Instagram, one commented: "Refs were looking at you on the last play than looking on the foul," with a Brooklyn fan saying: "You definitely distracted KD tonight, one of his worst games all season," with another adding: "She no longer World Cup girl..she Miss Miami now."   As well as potentially catching the attention of NBA players and officials last night, Knoll said she received messages from a number of players at the World Cup after being pictured on numerous occasions. Speaking to Barstool Sports: "Yes! I remember a few players messaging how are you, blah blah blah." She did not reveal who the players were, but did state that they were from countries who played against her home, Croatia.  Knoll, 30, was crowned Miss Croatia in 2016, was reportedly in Miami to be at a party hosted by actos Leonardo Di Caprio. She told Barstool Sports that this was her third World Cup, after going to Brazil in 2014 and Russia in 2018, but stated that she would go viral worldwide after her images in Qatar.
