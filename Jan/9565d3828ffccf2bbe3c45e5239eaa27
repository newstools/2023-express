Prince Harry is suffering from "second child syndrome" according to a health expert who said the Duke of Sussex is "uncomfortable" with his brother's presence. Harry has come under fire after his book Spare hit the shelves yesterday. The memoir contained a number of allegations about members of his family, most prominently his brother whom he said physically attacked him during an altercation. But a health expert has said Harry may be "blaming others" for his problems, as he spoke about the impact of his mother's death in Spare. Abdullah Boulad, a behavioural expert, said: "In the long term, Harry may focus for the rest of his life on blaming others for his missed childhood and life circumstances. Alternatively, he may start to accept and focus on what he can influence going forward for himself and Meghan. "This has all come about due to the death of his mother in his childhood, the stress of royal duties without being able to live a normal life, no real mother or family figures and no real ability to make his own choices about his life. Everything in his life has had to be about or for others. "In general, second-born children can suffer from the so-called second child syndrome. This is when the second born gets uncomfortable with the presence of their siblings due to the lack of importance or attention when the attention is given to older siblings. Particularly in a royal family when it is clear who the next heir to the throne will be, the focus will be on the older child who is next in line to the throne."   Harry has made a number of allegations against Prince William in recent months, with the heir to the throne also being discussed in his Netflix documentary with wife Meghan Markle. He claims William physically attacked him during a heated argument in 2019 about wife Meghan Markle, before his older sibling returned a short while later and apologised. Despite the bombsell claims, Harry did admit to having a "spotty memory" when writing his memoir but insisted his version of events have "just as much truth" as "so-called objective facts". The Duke defended possible inaccuracies in his book, Spare, which was released in the UK yesterday, as "misremembering" details surrounding his mother Princess Diana's death.

A friend of Prince William yesterday said he "could have a f****** field day" with the "s***" he has on the Duke of Sussex. A close friend of William branded Harry "outrageously disloyal" after William was "always there to pick up the pieces". The friend said: "There’s so much stuff over the years that Harry has rung friends up about and said, ‘throw away that photo, promise you won’t speak about this’. You could have a f****** field day with s*** on Harry. So could William, who (in comparison) is as clean as a whistle. I can’t believe he’d stoop so low." Another friend warned there is "so much we could say" about Prince Harry. He told the Times: “It’s strategically not clever. Harry is good at getting his narrative out there but we know so much, we’ve cleaned up so many messes over the years."

He said: "It's cruel, cowardly and so sad for William to keep taking the punches. He's keeping quiet for the good of his family and the country."
