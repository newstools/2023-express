King Charles and Princess Anne appeared in high spirits as they stepped out to attend the traditional Sunday morning service. Brother and sister are spending their Sunday together in Sandringham, and were photographed walking the short distance between the royal residence in Norfolk and St Mary Magdalene Church. The pair smiled at the royal fans they encountered on their way to the chapel, and King Charles even seemed to crack a joke with some of the onlookers while passing by. This public appearance comes following claims King Charles has asked Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, to broker a deal with Prince Harry so that the fifth-in-line to the throne can attend his Coronation in May. A source claimed to the Mail on Sunday: "The issue of substance is whether they attend the Coronation, and if they do, under what terms and conditions. "The family is split, and all the indications are that Harry is being advised to agree to nothing at this stage and 'play it long' right up to the last minute, which is making negotiations with him very difficult. "Harry's camp made clear that the idea that he would just attend the Coronation and behave himself but then be stripped of his titles was a total non-starter. "While he might decide at some point to discard his titles of his own volition, he objects to the idea of being forcibly stripped of them."
