Lisa Marie Presley's public memorial took place Sunday at Graceland with her mother Priscilla Presley taking to the stage to leave a few words on behalf of one of her grandchildren. Lisa's daughter Riley Keough, 33, sat front row as her husband Ben Smith-Peterson took to the stage to share some words on his wife's behalf. During the service, which was held at Elvis' Graceland home in Memphis, Tennessee, Riley remembered her mother's enduring love and strength in a speech delivered by Ben. It began: "I'm eternally grateful to have spent 33 years with you. I'm certain I chose the best mother for me in this world... I remember everything. "I remember you giving me baths as a baby.

"Thank you for giving me strength, my heart, my empathy, my courage, my sense of humour, my manners, my temper, my wildness, my tenacity. "I'm a product of your heart, my sisters are a product of your heart, my brother is a product of your heart. I hope you finally know how loved you were here. "Thank you for trying so hard for us. If I didn't tell you every day, thank you." This was the first time the gender of Riley's daughter had been confirmed, however, Ben did not include any specifics like her name.
