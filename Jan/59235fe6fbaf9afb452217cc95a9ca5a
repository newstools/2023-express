The world No 5 continued: "Physically, mentally, game-wise he's definitely one of the best players in the world for the last five years. He's established himself, he's a Grand Slam winner, he's a former No 1 in the world so he's someone that I respect a lot and we had some amazing battles over the years, we're hoping for another good battle tomorrow."

Discussing the match, he said: "I think the scoreline probably doesnt give you the right idea of what happened on the court. "It was such a close match, almost two hours for two sets. The first set it was extremely exhausting for both of us, we pushed eachother to the limit physically, lots of long exchanges, rallies in the first six or seven games of the first set. He made a couple of double faults. With 4-3 in the first set for me with new balls, the match turned around for me, I started feeling more relaxed on the court, played really well. "He got back in the second set but I just managed to stay I guess mentally composed in the right moments and play my best tennis, and I'm definitely pleased with the way I fought tonight."
