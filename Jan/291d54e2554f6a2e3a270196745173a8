Dolly Parton, 76, set pulses racing as she slipped into a sultry Playboy bunny outfit for her iconic 1978 Playboy magazine cover. The country superstar did not spare a detail as she transformed into one of the magazineâ€™s famous models by wearing a figure-hugging black corset. She completed the look with pink, sequin-embellished cuffs and collar and a white, diamond-encrusted bowtie. The singer completed the look by adding a pair of black bunny ears over her voluminous blonde hair, which was short at the time. Dolly smiled broadly as she adjusted her bowtie, putting her red nails on display as they matched her lipstick to perfection.
