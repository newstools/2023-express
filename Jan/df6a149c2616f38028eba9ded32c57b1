The January transfer window is just a few days away from closing with clubs now scrambling to get deals done before the deadline. Chelsea have been by far the busiest club of all and completed their SEVENTH January signing on Friday with a deal agreed for Malo Gusto. The full-back will be loaned back to Lyon for the remainder of the season, but Chelsea may not be done there. Moises Caicedo's future appears to be decided after the midfielder took to Instagram on Friday with a come-and-get-me plea. Arsenal recently had a Â£60million bid rejected by Brighton, opening the door for other clubs to enter the fray. The Gunners remain the favourites to sign the in-demand midfielder, but Chelsea and Liverpool have also been linked with him. Everton are also set to appoint Sean Dyche as their next manager with the former Burnley boss expected to be given funds in the final days of the transfer window.
