On the evening of January 19, 1915, the skies over Britain were largely quiet. There was a war happening on the continent, and Westminster had just months before decided that it was crucial that the country join the allies. Germany had by then orchestrated at least one air attack on the UK, targeting the frontier town of Dover — an attempt that was largely unsuccessful. It wasn't until that fateful night on January 19 that the true extent of aerial warfare was realised, when Great Yarmouth and King's Lynn, both on the East Coast, were pummelled by bombs dropped from two German Zeppelins. It would mark the first time the Germans had successfully bombed British towns. They would strike again the following evening, on January 20. The destruction was undeniable: four civilians were killed and 16 injured, while an estimated £7,740 (£207,300 adjusted for inflation) in damage was caused. The Daily Express captured the extent of the attacks in its swift reportage the day afterwards, collected in this story.
