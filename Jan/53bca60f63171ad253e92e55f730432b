After more than two years of waiting, fans were delighted to see Starz’s hit crime drama BMF finally premiere season two. However, the thrill soon turned to rage after Lamar (played by Eric Kofi-Abrefa) also returned to the streets of Detroit.  After season one ended with a major cliffhanger, fans were eager to see the show make its highly anticipated return. Thankfully for fans, season two picked up right where it left off following the nail-biting shoot-out. B-Mickie (Myles Truitt) was forced to prove his alliance to BMF and kill his friend and fling Kato (Ajiona Alexus) for being an informant for Lamar. Lamar had also seemingly met his demise, but this was too good to be true as fans learned the villain was in the hospital, on life support.

Instead, Lamar was rushed to the hospital and put under supervision with a fake name, as police hoped to pin the attack on Meech. As he suddenly gained consciousness, fans took to Twitter to share their rage at his resurrection. A fuming @boujiebeee wrote: “Bruh Lamar is a f*****g roach fr this b***h just won’t die!!!!!” (sic).    @803Jamie tweeted: “Man LAMAR IS ALIVE???? Meech and Terry finna be going thru the STRUGGLE this season.” (sic) An angered @iam2Flyy added: “Can’t believe this b***h ass n***a Lamar back s**t just p****d me off.” @DrizzyyDrizz shared: “Not Lamar still being alive & about to get on my nerves for another whole season!” As @KingJordan_57 anticipated: “You know all hell bout to break loose when the first thing you here is ‘Ready or Not, here I come’ when Lamar woke up.” DON'T MISS...Coronation Street star makes return to cobbles after three years [INSIGHT]Sorcha Cusack has left Father Brown as Mrs McCarthy after 10 years [INSIGHT]BMF season 2: Star drops hint at trouble ahead of Markaisha and Terry [INSIGHT] Although many were annoyed to see Lamar back on screens, others were pleased and eager to see his storyline. @_meldoll stated: “I'm actually glad Lamar ain't dead he adds the right amount of suspense.” While @theeeempress11 joked: “If Lamar can come back 2 life so can Ghost.” (sic). Lamar’s return will undoubtedly bring trouble for Meech, his brother Terry Flenory (DaVinci Juste) and the entire BMF crew.   With Meech believing Lamar was dead, this left the rival gang, 12 Street Boyz, without a leader. As a result, he convinced the two gangs to set aside their differences and form the Black Mafia Family, but with Lamar back, Meech’s plans could easily go awry. The premiere also revealed Terry had turned his back on crime and used his malpractice pay-out to start a car service business with his dad. Although B-Mickie killed Kato for snitching, he too had become an informant for detective Von Bryant (Steve Harris), however, fans will have to stay tuned to see how this will play out for him.  BMF season 2 continues Fridays on Starz in the US and on LIONSGATE+ in the UK.
