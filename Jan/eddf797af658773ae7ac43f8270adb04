  Yesterday, Liz shared a sizzling snap of herself wearing a white, triangle bikini top held together by a gold chain clasp. The star, who wore a brunette locks down in natural waves for the pictures, could be seen looking off wistfully as the filter changes with each shot. “One Celestial bikini - three filters,” Liz captioned the photos with “Red Heart” and “Face Blowing a Kiss” emojis. Liz’s followers were quick to comment on the star’s beauty, with Thomas writing: “One filter is nice, but 3? A gift from the Gods. Thanks.” (sic) While Scott added: “My Gawd, is this woman a true Goddess or what.” (sic) Julie also commented: “You are amazing! To be granted the privilege of a beautiful body - and you’ve looked after it so well. You deserve all the adulation.” (sic)
