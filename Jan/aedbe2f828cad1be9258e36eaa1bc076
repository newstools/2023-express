Spice Girl Emma has not responded to Holly's jibe but the crowd responded well to the light-hearted joke. Back in 2019 she joked about why she could "no longer be friends" with the Spice Girl.  Emma burst into nervous laughter after being put on the spot by Phil Schofield on This Morning as he asked her: "How was Frozen 2?" But before Emma could even answer, Holly cut in with: "I'm not sure we can be friends anymore! What happened?!" Emma admitted while watching the film with her children, she had fallen asleep. She explained: "It was because I'd had a very early morning with the children, we'd come up to town, we had a wonderful day, in the evening we thought 'oh we'll round it off and we'll watch Frozen.'"
