The £300 payment will be made on top of Winter Fuel payments, which in late 2022 were made to nearly every pensioner who turned 66 born before September 26, 2022. In winter 2023/2024, the Winter Fuel and Cost of Living Payments are expected to be made to those who reach the state pension age before September 25, 2023. That means most people born before September 25, 1957 will get Winter Fuel Payments plus an extra £300. The amount paid in Winter Fuel Payments can vary depending on who the person lives with, their age and if they claim any benefits other than a pension, but the £300 Cost of Living Payment is the same for everybody who qualifies. The DWP said: “Exact payment windows will be announced closer to the time but the 2022/2023 payments were made from November, so expect a similar timescale in Winter 2023/2024.”
