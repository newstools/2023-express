Rishi Sunak has been blasted for not responding to the plea of the unions as many workers continue to strike across the parts of the UK demanding better pay rise. Speaking to ITV’s Robert Peston, Unison General Secretary Christina McAnea claimed Prime Minister Sunak had failed to respond to her correspondence.  She said: “We are happy to meet Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt. “We have asked them to meet and we haven’t heard anything back. “I am working to try and make sure they come and talk to us and we are not just getting anyone. “I am getting a bit sick of hearing that Prime Minister always say ‘door is always open’, but it’s clearly not.   “I am happy to walkthrough that door anytime but it’s not open.” The Prime Minister had said the “door is always open” for dialogue with trade unions representing healthcare workers.
