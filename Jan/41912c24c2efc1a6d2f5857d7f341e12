The January transfer window wraps up for another year tomorrow, but as always, the home stretch is generally when things start to heat up. The likes of Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United and Tottenham are still keeping their eyes peeled for squad improvement opportunities as we venture further into the second half of the campaign. The Gunners are leading the Premier League title race and manager Mikel Arteta is evidently keen to consolidate his side's position. Two lucrative approaches for Brighton's Moises Caicedo have been slapped down but that may not spell the end of Arsenal's midfielder hunt. Chelsea are also in the market for a general in the middle of the park, and an audacious swoop for Enzo Fernandez is certainly one to keep an eye on over the coming hours. The Blues held talks earlier this month so co-owner Todd Boehly is well aware of the demands on the table, yet discussions are believed to have re-opened.
