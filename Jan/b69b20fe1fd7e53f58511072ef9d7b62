Mark Greenwood, from Normanton, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for a number of child sexual offences back in 2019. The 57-year-old pleaded guilty to six sexual offences and three counts of making indecent images of a child at Leeds Crown Court. But after a second complainant came forward to report that she had also been abused by Greenwood, Wakefield District Safeguarding Unit opened up a new investigation. Greenwood pleaded guilty to this offence in November, and saw his prison sentence extended during sentencing on Friday. Detective Constable Will Denton, of the Wakefield District Safeguarding Unit, said in a statement: “We welcome the extension to Greenwood’s sentence and commend the bravery of the victim and her family for coming forward and speaking with our officers. “There is no doubt that he is a dangerous man who deserves to remain behind bars for a substantial amount of time. “I hope this result will encourage other victims to engage with our specially trained officers who work tirelessly to bring offenders to justice.” Anyone with child safeguarding concerns is advised to contact either West Yorkshire Police or their local authority’s children’s social services.
