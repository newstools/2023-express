This is such a great way to start the New Year and we wish our winners all the best for 2023 and beyond. “We're seeing in the New Year right with a boost to the Premium Bonds prize fund rate to three percent - the highest it's been in 14 years. This means a bigger prize pot and more higher value prizes that all Premium Bonds customers have a chance to win - a wonderful way to start 2023. "This month’s prize draw sees a record of nearly £300million worth of prizes up for grabs.” The prize checker on the NS&I website works by a person putting in their holder’s number. The tool will then tell them if they have any uncollected prizes, from the latest prize draw or from previous draws.

The prize fund increased this month to an estimated £299,572,750, with the prize amounts varying, with the smallest prize of £25. There were three times as many prizes for this month for winnings of £100,000, £50,000, £25,000, £10,000 and £5,000. Despite the changes, the odds of a person winning money from Premium Bonds will stay fixed at 24,000 to one.

Gary Hemming, the commercial lending director at ABC Finance, warned about the “big risk” to Premium Bond holders of not winning any prizes. He said: “Premium Bonds are a safe way to invest, but you run a big risk of not receiving any return on your money – especially if you hold less than £5,000. “While you can win big and benefit from excellent returns, the reality is that this is unlikely and with average returns of 2.2 percent, you can get stronger returns from regular savings accounts currently.  “With inflation higher than even the highest interest savings accounts, the real value of your savings will drop over time. “It’s important that you mitigate this by locking in valuable interest at the best rate you can get to protect the buying power of your money as much as possible.” Premium Bonds prizes have no time limit, so a person can collect prizes from as far back as the original 1957 prize draw. Premium Bonds need to have been held for one month before being entered into a draw.
