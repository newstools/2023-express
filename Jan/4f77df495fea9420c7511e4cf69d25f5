Premier League clubs are on the hunt for new signings during the January transfer window, with the allure of silverware on the horizon. But Chelsea could get the upper hand in the race to sign new players thanks to Todd Boehly’s willingness to splash the cash. And Express Sport takes a look at five Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal and Tottenham targets the Blues could try to steal.  Mykhaylo Mudryk Ukraine international Mykhaylo Mudryk has been linked with Arsenal since last summer. And the 22-year-old winger has even been dropping hints on his Instagram account that he wants to move to the Emirates Stadium. But the Gunners are yet to have an offer accepted after refusing to stump up the transfer fee Shakhtar Donetsk are demanding. And earlier this month it was reported that Chelsea are keen to thrash out a deal with the Ukrainian club to bring Mudryk to the Premier League. Jude Bellingham Liverpool have been long-term admirers of Borussia Dortmund midfielder Jude Bellingham and are thought to be the frontrunners in the quest to land the star. The 19-year-old already turned down a move to Stamford Bridge when Frank Lampard was in charge. Win a pair of tickets to the Premier League or Women's Super League match of your choosing!

And the American could make the player an offer he can’t refuse in an attempt to persuade him to snub Anfield and head to west London instead. Moises Caicedo Liverpool are desperate for midfield reinforcements as they attempt to overcome their poor form. The Reds are seven points outside of the Premier League top four and face a huge battle to qualify for next season’s Champions League. As well as Bellingham, Liverpool are thought to be keen on Brighton ace Moises Caicedo, who is also reportedly a target for Manchester United. But Caicedo is now said to be on a five-man Chelsea midfield shortlist. And some reports claim Liverpool expect the 21-year-old Ecuador international to opt for a move to Stamford Bridge.

And Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag is said to be a big fan of the 25-year-old. Thuram is out of contract in Germany at the end of the season and will be free to leave Monchengladbach in the summer. But the Blues have entered the fray to sign him, which means the Red Devils could ultimately end up missing out on the star. Pedro Porro Sporting Lisbon wing-back Pedro Porro is being chased by Tottenham after bagging an incredible 11 goals and 19 assists in 94 games for his current club. But reports suggest Chelsea have now moved ahead of Spurs in the race to sign him. And Boehly could wrap a deal up before the Lilywhites can react.
