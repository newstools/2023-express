NFL hopeful Devin Willock was tragically killed in a car wreck just days after helping Georgia Bulldogs to the College Football Playoff National Championship title. Willock was with a recruiting staff member, who was also sadly killed in the crash. The single-vehicle crash occurred at approximately 2.45am on Sunday local time in Georgia. Two other members of the football program were injured in the crash, but both are in a stable condition, the university confirmed. Willock, 20 years old, was pronounced dead at the scene, while Chandler LeCroy, a member of the recruiting staff, was airlifted to hospital and pronounced dead shortly after. Just hours before the crash, a parade had been held in Georgia to celebrate, with a ceremony at Sanford Stadium taking place afterwards. The car left the road, hitting two power poles and numerous trees, an initial investigation found. LeCroy, who stood at 6ft 7in, was predominantly used as a backup for the Bulldogs this past season, but was expected to challenge for a starting spot next season with Warren McClendon and Warren Ericson declaring for the NFL draft. In a statement, Georgia head coach Kirby Smart said: “We are all heartbroken and devastated with the loss of Devin Willock and Chandler LeCroy. “Devin was an outstanding young man in every way. He was always smiling, was a great teammate and a joy to coach. [Devin was] a valuable member of our football staff and brought an incredible attitude and energy every single day. We grieve with their families for this tragic loss and will support them in every way possible.” Willock had just days ago posed for a picture with a young fan, letting the youngster hold his championship ring in the snap.
