Newly-married Rita Ora, 32, returned to the Heaven nightclub stage in London on Saturday night to debut her new single, You Only Love Me. The love song is dedicated to her movie producer and actor husband Taika Waititi, 47, and it wasn't long before The Masked Singer panellist was inundated with bouquets of flowers to celebrate her nuptials during the live performance. Rita showed off her incredibly toned physique while belting out her latest track in a completely see-through latex dress. The star, who often shows off her unique sense of style on Instagram, opted to go braless for her appearance at the club, covering her modesty with star nipple covers, while wearing just a nude thong underneath her gown. Rita completed the daring look with towering heeled boots and let her long curled hair tumble down her back. It comes after the British Hot Right Now hitmaker finally confirmed she had tied the knot with Taika in secret, as she admitted to The Sun: "I am officially off the market."
