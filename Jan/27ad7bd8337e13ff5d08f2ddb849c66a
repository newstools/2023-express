A mother harassed a former friend who she believed had been "slagging her off" on GMTV. Tracey Hendrie, 50, was slapped with a restraining order after a series of incidents which culminated in her scratching the victim's car and causing hundreds of pounds worth of damage. A court heard Hendrie, who had been pals with her victim for around 12 years before the trouble started, became "irrational and paranoid", believing her ex-friend had been hacking her Facebook account and criticising her on a breakfast television programme. The defendant turned up at her victim's house at 3.30am on one occasion, shouting abuse and banging on windows. She yelled: "Get out here and face me - when is this going to stop?" Hendrie admitted harassment and criminal damage, and was given a 12-month community order and told to complete 40 hours unpaid work at Teesside Magistrates' Court last week. Hendrie had previously received support from her victim including help with accommodation and finances while the pair's daughters were also friends, Teesside Live reports.  However, the relationship turned sour in December 2021 as the court heard the friend had been "inappropriately involving herself" in her personal affairs. The confrontation at the victim's house in Saltburn-by-the-Sea, North Yorkshire, happened in June last year, during which Hendrie scratched the woman's car bonnet and caused £350 worth of damage. In a statement, her victim spoke of the distress the harassment had caused. She said: "This has felt like an invasion upon me and my home. I would like to know why she forced her anger on me and my family. I do wish the defendant well but no longer want anything to do with her." Colin Sleeman, representing Hendrie, said his client had initially visited the woman's home and been civil in an attempt to discuss the issues between them but admitted that she had become angry and frustrated on later visits. He added that there had been no further contact between the pair since June.
