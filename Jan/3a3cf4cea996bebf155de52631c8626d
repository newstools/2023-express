Manchester United were brought back down to earth following their fine run of form on Wednesday night as they were held to a 1-1 draw by Crystal Palace in the Premier League. Red Devils boss Erik ten Hag has overseen an upturn in fortunes at Old Trafford since joining the club last year but will be keen to bolster his squad before the end of this month’s transfer window as his team go in search of silverware. United shelled out mega money in the summer to sign the likes of Lisandro Martinez, Casemiro and Antony, with the trio all playing a key role in the revival of the 13-time Premier League champions. And this month the club have already signed Wout Weghorst on loan from Burnley and Jack Butland on loan from Crystal Palace. Weghorst was handed his debut at Selhurst Park and lasted 69 minutes as his new team took the lead in the 43rd minute courtesy of a strike from Bruno Fernandes. But 21-year-old winger Michael Olise claimed a share of the spoils for the hosts as he struck a sensational free-kick in stoppage time at the end of the match. United have been linked with a whole host of new players as they look to continue their upward trajectory under Ten Hag. There could be interest in Tottenham star Harry Kane, who has just 18 months left on his deal in north London, while the battle for Brentford goalkeeper David Raya is also hotting up. Meanwhile, Harry Maguire’s future is far from certain as the player continues to be overlooked by his manager. Express Sport will have all the latest United transfer news and gossip.
