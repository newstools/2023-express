Christie Brinkley, 68, looked extremely youthful as she put her toned legs on display as she soaked up the sun on holiday. The Sports Illustrated legend posed for a photo in a hot pink swimsuit while sailing during her Turks And Caicos holiday. Christie looked radiant as she smiled from ear to ear and relaxed in a floral robeÂ and multi-coloured bucket hat. The model wished her 816,000 Instagram followers a New Year as she took a well-deserved break to enjoy the sunshine. Prior to her sun-soaked post, Christie had shared a video of herself raising a glass of Prosecco to the New Year in an elegant off-the-shoulder black dress.
