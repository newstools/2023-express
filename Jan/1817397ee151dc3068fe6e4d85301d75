Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag could decide that Sunday’s 3-2 defeat by Premier League leaders Arsenal is proof that the Red Devils need more signings this month. United were a level behind the Gunners, despite the close scoreline, and Ten Hag might conclude that there must be further investment in the squad if the Old Trafford outfit are going to challenge for the league in his maiden season. United have been linked with several targets as the January transfer window enters its final seven days. A right-back could be on the agenda, especially after Aaron Wan-Bissaka struggled against Arsenal. Attention could then turn to the summer. Ten Hag wants an elite forward to lead his line next term. Harry Kane has been linked and after equalling the record for most Tottenham goals on Monday night, the England captain might decide he wants a fresh challenge. Victor Osimhen and Dusan Vlahovic are also reported targets. So, will we see any movement from the Red Devils today? Follow Express Sport's live coverage of all of today’s Man Utd transfer news…
