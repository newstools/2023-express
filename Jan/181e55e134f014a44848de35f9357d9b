Brendan Fraser, 54, showed off his impressive transformation as he took to the red carpet last night for the 34th annual Palm Springs International Film Festival. The Mummy star walked the red carpet in a dark blue velvet blazer, paired with a white top and a bow tie. He sported a close-cropped hairdo and wore black-rimmed eyeglasses, as he showed off his slimmed-down appearance. Brendan was accompanied by his partner Jeanne Moore who donned a shoulderless black dress with navy embellishments. The Hollywood actor is making his comeback by playing a 600-pound man in his upcoming film, The Whale.
