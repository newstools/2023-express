Further bank branch closures will take place in 2023, with nine different branches affected. TSB has announced which particular branch will close, as well as the date it will close. There's still some time to go until the closures, with all nine closing in May 2023. A TSB Spokesperson said: “The decision to close a branch is never taken lightly, but our customers are banking differently – with more using digital banking. “We remain committed to a national branch network and have invested £30million upgrading it over the last two years. “Through video, telephone, digital, branch and other face-to-face services TSB customers now have more ways to bank with us than ever before.” Aberfeldy - Bank Street, Aberfeldy, PH15 2BB Date closing: May 16, 2023 Banbury - 61 High Street, Banbury, OX16 5JR Date closing: May 31, 2023 Evesham - 1 Bridge Street, Evesham, WR11 4SQ Date closing: May 4, 2023 Keynsham - 13-15 High Street, Keynsham, BS31 1DP Date closing: May 2, 2023 Kirkwall - 1 Broad Street, Kirkwall, KW15 1HE Date closing: May 24, 2023 Luton - 9 Manchester Street, Luton, LU1 2QB Date closing: May 30, 2023 Newark - 37 Castlegate, Newark, NG24 1BD Date closing: May 9, 2023 Pemberton - 675 Ormskirk Road, Pemberton, Wigan, WN5 8AH Date closing: May 11, 2023 Pollok - 1 Braidcraft Place, Glasgow, G53 5EU Date closing: May 17, 2023 Elsewhere this week, Lloyds and Halifax, which are both owned by Lloyds Banking Group, announced further bank branch closures.
