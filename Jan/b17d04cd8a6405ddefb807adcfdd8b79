 The former wife of the late Elvis Presley, and renowned actress in her own right, appeared at a Q&A event in the run-up to her own biopic. The 77-year-old donned an all-black ensemble for the event with some subtle sequins to accentuate her figure. She also sported her iconic bright red hair and opted for a simple, natural makeup look. Priscilla is currently working as an executive producer on her own upcoming biopic and announced last month that it had officially started filming. Sofia Coppola will be directing the movie, featuring Cailee Spaeny as Priscilla and Jacob Elordi as the late rockstar Elvis.
