The poor creatures were all brought to safety by the RSPCA, which has shared some of the most “weird and wonderful” incidents it attended in the past year. They include a seal pup which was rescued from the top of a 50ft cliff next to a wartime pillbox in Weybourne, Norfolk. Amy Pellegrini, who returned the pup to the beach, said: “He must have just taken a wrong turn and then followed the coastal path to the cliff edge.” Fast food fans got a fright in July when a boa constrictor slithered through a McDonald’s in Bognor Regis, West Sussex. The non-venomous snake was passed on to staff, who placed it in a box before it was collected.  A Hispaniolan common tree frog was found far from home in Staffordshire after arriving from the Dominican Republic. Iain Holloway, from Tamworth, said: “We were unpacking the shopping in the kitchen and my wife said ‘look, there’s a frog in the bananas’.” A recurring theme was foxes getting their heads stuck or hedgehogs being trapped in pipes. One fox cub was in a fix when he got his head stuck in a car wheel in Selly Oak, Birmingham. And in August, RSPCA rescuers used barbecue tongs to pull a hedgehog free from an open drain in Hull, East Yorkshire.  Firefighters were called to rescue another who had tumbled 25ft into a historic ice house near Scarborough in September. One hapless cat became trapped in a dry stone wall in Bishop Auckland, County Durham, and was only freed when firefighters dismantled the wall. RSPCA inspectorate commissioner Dermot Murphy said: “With our teams out rescuing animals 365 days a year, we are often their only hope.”
