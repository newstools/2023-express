Near-identical strangers, who even share the same name, have taken a DNA test to see if they are related. Brady Feigl had a big shock when he came across doppelg√§nger who stands the same height at 6,4ft , have the same red hair, and both wear glasses. Both men also chose to follow the same career in professional baseball. The duo first came across each other in 2015 when they both suffered an elbow injury and underwent surgery by the same doctor, Dr James Andrews. Brady said he was contacted by the surgery to ask when he was coming in for the operation, which he had six months prior. He said: "I was probably six or seven months out of surgery and their office called our trainer and said, "Hey, when's Brady reporting for surgery? Is he getting down here tomorrow? "He was like, 'He had it six months ago. What are you talking about?' That's how I found out there were two of us." On another occasion someone wished Brady a happy birthday on Twitter, confusing the two again. The wrong Brady was tagged in the tweet, with the other baseball star replying: "Wrong Brady Feigl. Might be looking for @bfeigl39." Brady, 22 plays baseball for Oakland Athletics Single-A baseball team and was born in Missouri, while Brady, 27, from Maryland, plays for the Texas Rangers' Triple-A team.

But the likeness is just as coincidence as it turns out they are not. But the senior of the two said: "We're still brothers in a way. "And we'll always be Brady Feigl."
