The Great British Bake Odd judge, 82, is an advocate for assisted dying. She witnessed her brother David lose his battle with bone cancer in excruciating pain during 2012, aged 74. Now Dame Prue has revealed how she intends to have the “ultimate happy ending” She said: "I'm a great campaigner for assisted dying. I want to be able to top myself when I've had enough of this good life. The ultimate happy ending. "I want to go out with a glass of wine in my hand and a lot of my friends around me. What started it [campaigning for assisted dying] was that my brother had the most appalling death. "I thought, 'this is crazy'. He wanted to die, he was asking the doctors to let him die. They couldn't give him enough painkillers but they also couldn't help him die. "I remember talking to some Macmillan nurses, who said I was begging them to give him more ng ore morphine, but they said, 'If you knew how many times we hear that every week when we're visiting people who ask to end this misery'. "But they say, 'We can't do it, because it's against the law'."
