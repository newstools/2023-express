The misconduct notices which these four officers have been given are served to tell officers they are being investigated. However, it does not necessarily mean any wrongdoing has occurred, only that they are being investigated.A spokesperson for the IOPC said: "We can confirm that four Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) officers have been served misconduct notices as part of our ongoing investigation. “A police sergeant and three police constables have been served notices in relation to the arrest and detention of the child, who was strip-searched by MPS officers. “The serving of misconduct notices does not necessarily mean disciplinary proceedings will follow. Due to the sensitivities surrounding this matter, we cannot provide any further information at this time"
