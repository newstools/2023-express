Manchester United's search for a striker in the January transfer window continues as Besiktas continue to delay Wout Weghorst's exit. But Erik ten Hag will be confident of sealing at least one more arrival this month as he prepares to challenge on all fronts in the second half of the season. Manchester City's shock EFL Cup exit last night means United are the only English team remaining in all four competitions. And with only one striker at his disposal, Ten Hag will be desperate for reinforcements ahead of a hectic fixture schedule. United have been backed to splash £150million on a striker option, but it would come in the summer rather than this month. Elsewhere, Chelsea are following their recent trend of transfer battles by joining the Red Devils in the frame for a potential right-back target if Aaron Wan-Bissaka leaves before the winter deadline. Facundo Pellistri is also set for crunch talks about his Old Trafford future today after a promising debut against Charlton Athletic on Tuesday.
