Jane Seymour, 71, took to Instagram last night to share a rare photo alongside Dick Van Dyke, 97, who worked with her in the 2018 film Buttons: A Christmas Tale. The former Bond girl beamed as she cosied up with her fellow actor for a selfie, with Dick also smiling from ear to ear, despite suffering from a painful-looking eye, which appeared to be red and sore. Jane put her incredibly youthful complexion on display as she posed in the sunshine wearing a cream turtleneck and floral print scarf. Dick, who Jane branded “a beam of sunshine”, also looked phenomenal in a black T-shirt and grey fleece jacket. Jane captioned the snap: “I recently got to spend some time hanging out with the incredible Dick Van Dyke! “This man radiates joy and is just a beam of sunshine! “What’s your favourite Dick Van Dyk movie or show?”
