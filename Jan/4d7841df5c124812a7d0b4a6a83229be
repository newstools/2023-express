YouTube star KSI has expressed a desire to fight Conor McGregor at some point in the future, but vowed he wants to take on long-term rival Jake Paul first. KSI returns to the ring this weekend after beating Luis Pineda and Swarmz on the same night last year.  KSI was due to face Dillon Danis in his third professional fight this Saturday, having drawn with Logan Paul and beaten Pineda and Swarmz. However, just two weeks out from the bout, Danis pulled out, forcing the Brit to turn to another YouTuber - FaZe Temperrr. The 29-year-old has his sights set on a fight with Paul - who has won all five of his professional fights so far - before the end of the year. However, it seems the social media sensation also has another big name on his hit list in UFC mega star McGregor. Danis shot to fame after training with McGregor and that led to KSI becoming involved in a social media dispute with the two-time world champion Irishman, who dismissed him as a "friendly little nerd". KSI told MMA Fighting that he is interested in a crack at McGregor, but wants to get Paul out of the way first. He said: "After I flatline Jake, how cool would it be to have a go at the king? "With me, I believe in myself so much that I feel like I could take on anyone - within reason, I don't wanna take on [Artur] Beterbiev or Anthony Yarde. But you never know. That would be nuts." Paul has called out McGregor on numerous occasions in the past but has failed to draw a response from the MMA icon, something KSI seemed to find hilarious. He added: "I was gassed, I was like 'oh, rah, Conor tweeted at me?' "Jake has been on Conor's a*** but Conor's said nothing. I mentioned Conor once and he fired back, I was like 'I've got the sauce like that!'"
