Things got heated in the most recent instalment of Piers Morgan’s TalkTV show Uncensored as the host spoke about the UK’s decision to officially leave the EU three years ago. However, as he questioned where the benefits are, the host was shut down by a guest who told him Brexit has saved lives. Introducing the segment to viewers, Piers shared that the IMS recently revealed the UK economy will shrink this year, making it worse off than any other significant economy.Disgusted that other countries, including Russia, will grow faster than the British economy, Piers questioned why the UK is worse off.Before discussing the topic, he revealed Bloomsberg said Brexit has cost the UK economy £100 billion a year, with the economy 4 per cent smaller than it would have been if it had never happened.Asking where the benefits are of leaving the EU, Piers reminded people at the time when it came to voting, those who voted leave were promised £450 million a week for the NHS, although the NHS is currently struggling.

But look the first major benefit-” Piers cut in asking if he was wrong in what he had said in his opening statement about the impact Brexit has had on the economy.Richard replied: “You’re completely wrong, but the first major benefit was the vaccine roll-out, literally, Brexit saved lives because we all got vaccines.”Not agreeing, Gina shouted over Richard his information was "a lie" as she wanted to set the record straight.As things got heated with Richard trying to talk over her, she said: “No, I want to put this lie to bed, it’s not true.” DON'T MISS...

She replied: “One, we were in the transition period, so we were still under EU law. Secondly, no country, not even us or existing members, had to join the joint scheme.“That was not part of the agreement, the reason they did was not for sovereignty and law.“The EU countries decided for technical and medical reasons not to join the roll-out vaccines and not to go the route we did.”Elsewhere in the show, the host revealed although he voted to remain, he backed Brexit in the end as he believed in democracy and the will of the public, although that could now be changing.He shared a poll published by Unheard showed that 647 of the 650 UK constituencies now think Brexit was a mistake.Piers Morgan Uncensored continues weekdays on TalkTV from 8pm
