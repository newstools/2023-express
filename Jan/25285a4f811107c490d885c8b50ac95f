The Wagner Group is known for its battlefield cruelty, which includes the execution of soldiers who refuse to fight in front of terrified recruits, according to a fugitive Russian mercenary. Unwilling Russian recruits, according to Andrei Medvedev, 26, who is requesting asylum in Norway, were allegedly buried in graves dug by the just enlisted forces after being shot. He told CNN host Anderson Cooper: "They would round up those who did not want to fight and shoot them in front of newcomers. "They brought two prisoners who refused to go fight and they shot them in front of everyone and buried them right in the trenches that were dug by the trainees."
