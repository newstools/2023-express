Gwyneth Paltrow, who shared photos showing off her admirable figure alongside her equally stunning 18-year-old daughter Apple, is believed to be enjoying the Californian coastline after returning from a trip to Barbados. Despite enjoying some much-needed Caribbean sunshine in the Christmas season, it looked as if Gywneth had applied a generous helping of SPF as she maintained her usual pallour. The 50-year-old acting sensation also shared the boat with her mum, Blythe Danner, 79, who was the spitting image of her in her younger years. Beaming Gwyneth told the world that she had "wrapped up 2022 with a little bit of [sea]" while admitting she hadn't been slacking on the work front either. She recently interviewed reality star Kim Kardashian, 42, for the latest episode of her podcast, and coaxed her to divulge her dating secrets and "fantasy" of having a successful fourth marriage.
