James Jordan was admittedly left stunned as his wife Ola Jordan showcased her flawless figure after losing an incredible 3.5 stone. The former Strictly Come Dancing professional urged his other half to put on some clothes at home as they would be expecting guests - but Ola refused. The blonde haired professional dancer sauntered into their kitchen wearing racy lingerie as she put her impressive physique on full display. She took to Instagram to share a video of herself "tidying up" in the eye catching two piece as her husband James, 44, told her to "get ready". The mum-of-one strutted into the room with confidence as she left her long tresses loose and applied a radiant palette of makeup but refused to put on any clothes.
