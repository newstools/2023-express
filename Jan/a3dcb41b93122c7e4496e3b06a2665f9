Meghan and Prince Harry have a “bitter pill to swallow” after new polling suggests their popularity has plummeted not just in the UK - but in the US as well. While an Ipsos Mori poll this week suggests that Prince William and Kate have taken a popularity hit in the UK following the publication of Prince Harry’s memoir Spare, the Prince of Wales remains at the top of the pile for Britain’s favourite royal. But a Newsweek poll suggests that as much as Spare has damaged the Royal Family, it may not have helped Harry and Meghan themselves, with their US popularity dropping from +38 and +23 to -7 and -13 respectively. In what Daily Mail columnist Amanda Platell has described as a “bitter pill” for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex to swallow, this makes Kate - whom the book repeatedly pits against Meghan - the US’ most popular royal, and places the Duchess even below Queen Camilla, who was long demonised by the American audience following the death of Princess Diana.
