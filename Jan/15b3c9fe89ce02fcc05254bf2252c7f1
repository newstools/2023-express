Anyone travelling to the continent by ferry from Dover tomorrow is being urged to rethink their plans as strikes in France will cause severe disruptions. The Port of Dover is warning that ferry services to and from Calais will be suspended due to a national strike in France.  It said that "due to national industrial action in France, services to and from Calais will be suspended from 7am".    The ferry company warned that "due to the lack of details", it "cannot anticipate the level of disruption" that could still hit its changed sailing schedule.  The Port of Dover said it "is still open with services to Dunkirk running as normal", but travellers should expect the port and roads around Dover "will be busier than usual".  In a statement, the company added: "Please plan ahead, allowing extra time for your journey and traffic systems that are in place to minimise delays.  "Calais sailings are expected to resume at approximately 2pm UTC from Dover."    "It is expected that this action will affect multiple outlets and services throughout France."
