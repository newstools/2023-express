  David enthusiastically cheered on his talented son during the match, but quickly vanished after the final whistle blew. Afterwards, the football star could be seen making a speedy getaway over a fence. The star kept a low profile, wearing a navy blue anorak, a black cap and some jeans in order to blend in with the crowd. David shares four children with his wife Victoria Beckham, 48: sons Brooklyn, 23, Romeo and Cruz, 17, as well as daughter Harper, 11.
