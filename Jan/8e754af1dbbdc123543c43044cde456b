The Duke of Sussex's camp has reportedly claimed Prince Harry "resents" being "lumped" together with Prince Andrew. While the question of the attendance of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry at King Charles's Coronation in May doesn't appear to have found an answer yet, a source has claimed the Duke of Sussex isn't happy with reports putting him on the same level as the Duke of York. While both Dukes are no longer working members of the Firm whose attendance and prominence at the Coronation have yet to be confirmed, the reasons surrounding their decisions to step back are very different. Harry and Meghan stepped back as senior royals in the spring of 2020 after having tried to thrash out a deal with the Royal Family that would grant them to live a life more shielded from media scrutiny. Andrew, on the other hand, announced he would step back from public duties in November 2019 amid backlash following his interview with Emily Maitlis entirely focused on his association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The Duke of York has not yet resumed his role as senior royal and in January last year he also returned his military and royal patronages. A source told the Mail on Sunday: "He resents being lumped together with Andrew in the public mind as the two 'problem Princes', when he considers the circumstances to be totally different."
