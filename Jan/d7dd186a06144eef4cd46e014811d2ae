A millionaire locked up for building this vast garden entertainments complex illegally may face jail again – as his latest court deadline for making it unusable has expired. Graham Wildin was sent to prison for six weeks for repeatedly refusing to decommission the 10,000sq ft “man cave” including bowling alley, casino and cinema behind his home. The 70-year-old accountant, of Cirencester, Gloucestershire, was given 18 weeks from his release to meet a court order to make it unusable – and that time was up last Friday. Removals vans were on site recently but if the hangar is not stripped totally he may be sent back to jail. Officials may delay a decision on how to proceed until after Wildin’s March 1 appeal against the prison term. Forest of Dean District Council said: “This is an ongoing legal matter and the council will continue to pursue it.” Some observers online were scathing about Wildin’s stance, one writing: “Tick tock...knock, knock...it down.” Wildin was approached for comment.
