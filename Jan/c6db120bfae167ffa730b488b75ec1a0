There are sharp variations, with some areas recording as many as one in six 16-to- 24-year-olds identifying as LGB+. Young adults are also the most likely age group to say their gender identity is different from their sex registered at birth, with one in 100 identifying as such.  The latest data from the Office for National Statistics shows that 6.9 percent of 16-to- 24-year-olds identify as LGB+, the highest proportion of any age group and more than twice the figure for the total population (3.2 percent). The ONS said: “Local authorities with a relatively high proportion of people aged 16 to 24 who identified as LGB+ tended to have one or more universities.”   London boroughs have some of the highest LGB+ proportions for older age groups. Around 9.8 percent of 35-to-44-year-olds in Lambeth identify as LGB+.
