 On Sunday, the Blink-182 drummer, 47, debuted a new tattoo on the top of his right thigh, seemingly featuring his wife’s eyes. However, not all fans in the comments section were convinced, as some began debating whose eyes the design was based on, with the top contenders being Michael Jackson or Kourtney’s sister Kim. Others questioned the odd placement of the tattoo just above another one that reads ‘In memory’, claiming this was further evidence that the ink is a tribute to Michael Jackson. Further confusing their following, the couple posted a racy mirror selfie, which saw Kourtney smirking behind her phone in a minute minidress as Travis bent down behind her legs. Countless followers questioned: “What’s going on in that first pic?” while one declared: “Please tell me this is a pregnancy announcement.”
