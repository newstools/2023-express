The Warm Home Discount (WHD) offers households on low income £150 to help them heat their homes during the winter. Changes to the criteria for the WHD mean many who previously qualified are no longer eligible. So do you think the Government should U-turn on the changes and return to the old system? Vote in our poll.   Britons must be on means-tested benefits or tax credits and, for the first time, live in a property with a “high energy cost score based on its characteristics” to receive the WHD. This means many pensioners living in flats, bungalows, small houses or newer properties will not be eligible for the lifeline this year. Changes to the criteria were made in the spring but many households are only just finding out they are no longer eligible to receive the additional support. In addition, energy suppliers cannot extend the WHD to families in receipt of Disability Living Allowance. Qualifying households will automatically receive the discount alongside a letter by the end of March.

They said: “Our reforms last spring mean that more households in fuel poverty will benefit from the Warm Home Discount than ever before. “An extra 800,000 pensioners and low-income families will benefit this year compared to last and it is awarded according to people’s financial circumstances.” So what do YOU think?
