Imber in Wiltshire was cleared by allied forces during World War Two to make way for training exercises for D-Day. Residents were refused permission to return – and it remains part of the Salisbury Plain training area.  Since then it has only been open to visitors a few times a year and MoD permission is needed to be buried there. Imber held its last funeral yesterday for Ray Nash, 87. He had wanted to be buried alongside his father, who died in 1936 when Ray was one. He left with his mum soon afterwards. Son Kelvin, 63, said that despite the former mechanic barely remembering his time there, he felt drawn to the place, making regular visits to the family home.  Kelvin said: “The church was St Giles, so every year on St Giles day, September 1, we would go to the village which would be open to the public. My great uncle Albert was the blacksmith and was evacuated in 1943. He died in 1944 of a broken heart, according to his death certificate. It was a difficult thing for the family. “Arranging the funeral was much easier than I imagined. There is a man who has volunteered for 17 years to look after the village who sorted everything for us.”  Troops had to escort mourners into Imber. Kelvin added: “It is testament to dad that St Giles was filled with relatives and friends to fulfil his lifelong wish to be reunited with the father he never knew.”
