Blake Lively, 35, had no choice but to reinvent two different clothing pieces after finding out she could not wear them without suffering a wardrobe malfunction. The actress, who is expecting her fourth child with Ryan Reynolds, created a new outfit by combining a black dress with white polka dots that did not button and a sleek black skirt that would not zip. She shared the stylish result of her experimentation on Instagram with her 37.3 million followers on Sunday. Along with the Story, Blake wrote: “When the back of your skirt won't zip and the front of your dress won't button, wear both. Who says two wrongs don't make a right??” The style icon looked fabulous as she paired the monochromatic outfit with a pearl necklace and light red pumps. Blake spared no details as she matched her shoes to her lipstick and styled her luscious blonde waves in a side parting.
