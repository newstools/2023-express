The 38-year-old sat down with CBS' Anderson Cooper for his 60 Minutes interview at 7.30pm EST (12.30am GMT). He was also interviewed by ITV's Tom Bradby at 4pm EST (9pm GMT) ahead of the release of his book 'Spare' on January 10. When asked by Cooper about a "pretty cutting" account in his memoir, Prince Harry said: "I don’t see it as cutting at all. "You know, my brother and I love each other. I love him deeply. "There has been a lot of pain between the two of us, especially the last six years. "None of anything that I’ve written, anything I’ve included is ever intended to hurt my family. "But it does give a full picture of the situation as we were growing up, and also squashes this idea that somehow my wife was the one that destroyed the relationship between these two brothers."
