Robbie Jackson star Dean Gaffney, who initially played the classic EastEnders character from 1993 to 2004, has made several re-appearances in the BBC soap, returning for one-off episodes in 2010 and 2015 before re-joining the soap for a two-year stint from 2017 to 2019. He has been snapped alongside his former colleagues Natalie Cassidy, who stars as Robbie's sister Sonia Jackson, and Jamie Borthwick, who plays Jay Brown. Fans have predicted the reunion as a sing Robbie could be making a comeback. Dean, 44, joined EastEnders as schoolboy Robbie and was rarely seen without his dog, Wellard. The actor was spotted enjoying lunch with the two current BBC soap stars, causing speculation Dean might be gearing up to step back into Robbie's shoes. Natalie posted the snap of the trio on her Instagram account, writing: "When you have the January blues the only thing to do is have lunch with these pair. "Laughed so much I nearly wet myself. Love you both @jamie_b10 @deangaffney1."

Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks) had also been living with her but has now left the soap, so Robbie could potentially fill a room at Sonia's house. Furthermore, Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) made a comeback just before Christmas, and as Bianca Jackson's (Patsy Palmer) ex, it seems there is more scope for the Jacksons to reunite. Robbie was last seen working part-time as a market inspector, but his way of doing things sparked a strong reaction from Martin Fowler (James Bye) and Kush Kazemi (Davood Ghadami). He also left to visit his ex Nita Mistry (Bindya Solanki) and son Sami in India, and returned with Sami. Nita soon returned to collect their son, but several months later, she informed Robbie that Sami had been injured so he left Walford to rejoin his family. EastEnders continues on Monday at 7.30pm on BBC One.
