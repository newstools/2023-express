Former Manchester United star David Beckham, 47, put the biggest smile on the face of his oldest fan, 102-year-old Mona Hurry, who was a code-breaker in the Women's Royal Naval Service during the Second World War. Mona was enjoying a David Beckham appreciation day at Castor Lodge in Peterborough organised by her carers, who wore Beckham masks, but she didn’t expect to receive a personal message from the star himself. In the sweet video sent to Mona by the sportsman, he said: “Hey Mona, I just wanted to send you a message because everybody at Castor Lodge, all of the staff and of course your daughters, have said what an incredible lady you are. "I also want to say a personal thank you because I know you’ve followed my career and I know you're a huge football fan. "I'm sending lots of love for being an incredible person." Laura Mills, a manager at the care home, helped to organise the party and surprise video message, and was full of praise for both Mona and David, saying: "Mona adores David Beckham and loves to talk about him. She always says what a special, lovely and charitable man he is. "Mona is an incredibly sweet and kind lady herself, who always reaches out to everybody in the home to ask how they are." Mona, who has a life-sized cardboard cutout of Becks in her bedroom, also said of the Man U and England legend: “He doesn't have airs and graces."
