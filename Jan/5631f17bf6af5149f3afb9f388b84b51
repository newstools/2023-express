Don't you just hate it when you go for your big weekly supermarket shop and discover the trolleys now have the £1 coin-operated lock? Yes, the reasoning behind it makes sense, but all you want to do is get your shopping over with, right?  And with more of shoppers ditching cash in favour of contactless transactions, that elusive £1 coin needed to release the trolley can be a rare find in many wallets. You could withdraw some money from the cash machine and run inside to buy something cheap - good luck finding something - to get change. However, it's all a bit long-winded, isn't it? That's where the trolley hack comes into play. Tiktoker @rightguysreview revealed the hack "straight from the horse's mouth", employing the help of a shop assistant. All it takes is a cotton bud and some wiggling, and people are losing their minds.     One person wrote: "Literally finessed the system". Another person commented: "I was today years old when I learned this!" A third person added they learned this hack while working at the store, she said: "I learnt to do this when I worked at home bargains like this lady." However, one person wrote: "I’m more likely to carry £1 than a cotton bud." Other shop workers soon came forward to claim they were also taught this trick while working in stores. "We used a hair grip in our store," one person said, while another wrote: "I used a clip when working there." Another person commented: "Use the key from corn beef tin. Keep it on your keyring". And finally, one user commented: "Why not just put a token in?" It comes after a woman discovered the trolley function to prevent delicate items from getting squashed. Pointing to a section opposite the baby seat, she opened the compartments that keep goods like bread or flowers from getting crushed. She captioned the video: "Did you know this? Let me know, I’m in shock, I didn’t haha."
