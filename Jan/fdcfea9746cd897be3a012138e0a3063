Jennifer Lopez is Darcy, a multimillionaire’s daughter about to tie the knot with bland baseball star Tom (Josh Duhamel). In a reversal of gender norms, it’s the groomzilla who dreamed of the big, glitzy ceremony on the tropical island. Simple girl Darcy just wanted to quietly elope before settling down in an unpretentious mansion. Uptight Tom’s plans go awry when Darcy’s flashy ex (Lenny Kravitz) rocks up to deliver a showy but painfully unfunny speech. Then, more interlopers arrive. And this time, they’re packing guns. When the head of this gang of pirates demands Darcy’s dad hand over $8million, it’s up to the bickering couple to launch a rescue bid. The action scenes are competently staged and Jennifer Coolidge makes the most of the script’s two amusing lines as Tom’s gaffe-prone mother. But, like The Human Centipede, you suspect this is one of those films where they came up with the title first.
