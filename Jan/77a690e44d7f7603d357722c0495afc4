King Charles III’s coronation is set to take place on May 6, with three days of celebrations planned, including an appearance on the Buckingham Palace balcony. But do you think Prince Harry, Meghan Markle and Prince Andrew should join working members of the Royal Family? Vote in our poll. Daily Express royal correspondent Richard Palmer has said that as Harry, Meghan and Andrew are no longer senior working royals they have “no place” on the balcony. He told Pandora Forsyth on this week's Daily Express' Royal Round-Up that he expects the King to take the “moral high ground” and invite the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and Duke of York to the Coronation, but noted that working royals would be given precedence. He added: “If I had to guess at this stage for how things will work out this time round, and I don't believe, that there will be a place for the Sussexes or the Duke of York on the balcony."
