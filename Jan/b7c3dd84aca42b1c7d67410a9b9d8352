Fans of Apex Legends are counting down to the start of the Celestial Sunrise event. The Apex Legends Celestial Sunrise Collection event has a January 24 release date and a 6pm GMT UK launch time. Celebrating the Chinese New Year, the Celestial Sunrise event Running until February 7, the event introduces the new LTM Hardcore Royale mode, alongside new skins, items and other cosmetics. Apex developer Respawn explains more: "Celebrate the dawn of a new year as EA and Respawn today revealed the brand new Apex Legends Celestial Sunrise Collection Event, which will take place from January 24 through February 7. "The event will bring the introduction of the new LTM Hardcore Royale, which will put players’ skills to the ultimate test, as well as the new cosmetics such as the 'Jadeite Retribution' Reactive Peacekeeper Skin and more." The headline new feature is the Hardcore Royale LTM, which as the name suggests, is for experienced players only. As part of the limited-time mode, players will have a reduced HUD, making it harder to work out what's going on. You can check out some of the new skins and the Hardcore Royale game mode in the trailer below. Elsewhere, the ring starts at maximum damage, there's no EVO Armour or helmets, and no armour swapping. As part of the event, players will be able to unlock 24 limited-time cosmetics, including Legendary skins for Octane, Pathfinder, Caustic, Ash and more. The Celestial Sunrise Collection event will also feature a special rewards track for players looking for something to aim for. If you do manage to unlock all 24 cosmetics before the event is over, you'll receive the 'Jadeite Retribution' Reactive Peacekeeper Skin for free.
