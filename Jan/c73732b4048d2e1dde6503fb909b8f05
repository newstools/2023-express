The Goodfellow’s tree kangaroo is the first to arrive at Chester Zoo in its 91-year history. The roo was welcomed into the world by mum Kitawa and dad Kayjo in July and has been developing in her pouch since. Keepers, including Dave White, monitored its progress each week with an endoscope camera. The tiny species, native to Papua New Guinea, is endangered. Dave said the birth was a moment for “real celebration”. He explained: “When a joey is first born it’s only the size of a jellybean. Moments after the birth, with eyes still closed, it instinctively crawls up mum’s belly into her pouch – following a channel which she has marked by licking her fur." “Once safely in the pouch, the baby receives all of the nutrition it needs while it grows and develops until it pops its head out.” The roo’s sex won’t be known until it climbs from Kitawa’s pocket and learns to hop and climb trees, where the species live. Adults only weigh 15lb but can bound 30ft to the ground unharmed.
