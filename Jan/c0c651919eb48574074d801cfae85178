But as we usher in 2023, there’s one thing that hasn’t changed. Putin’s illegal war in Ukraine continues, with prices still rising at home as a result of his weaponisation of gas. We must stand firm. This year will not be easy, but we have a plan that will help to more than halve inflation and allow everyone’s incomes to go further. But we also recognise that, for many, more help is needed to keep things ticking over. That’s why we've given additional help over the past year to more than 8 million families struggling with the cost of daily essentials – things like rent and food shopping - and today we’ve set out when the most vulnerable can expect to receive extra help over the coming year. Millions of low-income households will get £900 in cash payments this year, with a further £300 and £150 for pensioners and people with disabilities.  Beginning in Spring, this money will automatically land in their bank accounts without them having to fill out any forms and will be split into five separate payments to ensure they get consistent support across the next financial year. That’s on top of our Energy Price Guarantee, which will save the average household £500 in 2023/24, the £400 energy rebate being paid through to March, uprating benefits and pensions in line with inflation, as well as changes to Universal Credit which will mean working families can keep more of what they earn. As we restore the public finances and promote long-term growth in the economy, these temporary and targeted measures offer a safety net for those most in need and provide some support for the rest of us as we embark on 2023.
