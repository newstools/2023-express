After weeks of speculation, Manchester United look to have put an end to their search for a striker by striking a deal to sign Burnley star Wout Weghorst. The Netherlands international endured a tough time in the Premier League previously but is seen as a cut-price way of bolstering the Red Devils’ forward line. Weghorst put himself in the shop window with an eye-catching display for the Netherlands against Argentina in the Qatar World Cup. The 30-year-old scored a late brace against the eventual winners in the quarter-finals to take the tie to extra time and then penalties. Experience on the big stage was a fundamental part of Erik ten Hag’s criteria when looking to sign a striker this month, following the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo earlier this season. Additionally, the forward had to be available for a small fee, as he paid the price for his summer spending spree. Weghorst is expected to arrive at United on loan, though he may not be the final signing of this month, with plenty of time left. Express Sport bring you all the latest from Old Trafford.
