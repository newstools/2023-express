In light of the costly flight control system glitch, President Joe Biden has ordered a full investigation into the causes. Some have speculated whether the technical failure could have been caused by a cyber attack but the White House says, so far, there has been no evidence to suggest this. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre confirmed that Mr Biden had been made aware of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) outage on Wednesday. Writing on Twitter, she said: "The President has been briefed by the Secretary of Transportation this morning on the FAA system outage. "There is no evidence of a cyberattack at this point, but the President directed DOT to conduct a full investigation into the causes. The FAA will provide regular updates." The FAA ordered all US flights to delay departures until 9am Eastern time, though airlines said they were aware of the situation and had already begun grounding flights.  At 7:30am, there were over 1,200 delayed flights within, into or out of the US, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware. More than 100 have been cancelled.Most delays were concentrated along the East Coast, but were beginning to spread west. Inbound international flights into Miami International Airport continued to land, but all departures have been delayed since 6:30am, said airport spokesman Greg Chin.The FAA said it was working on restoring its Notice to Air Missions System.“We are performing final validation checks and reloading the system now. Operations across the National Airspace System are affected", the FAA said.    MORE TO FOLLOW..
