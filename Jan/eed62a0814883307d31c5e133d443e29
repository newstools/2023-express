  Gina’s coffin is being kept at Rome's Capitoline Hill, so that mourners can bid farewell to one of the last icons of Hollywood’s Golden Age. The Mayor of Rome, Roberto Gualtieri, was there to welcome in the late icon’s coffin. Her funeral will commence at 12:30 tomorrow in the Church of the Artists in Rome's Piazza del Popolo. Gina was once described as "the most beautiful woman in the world" with her film roles including Crossed Swords (1954), the Hunchback of Notre Dame (1956) and Beautiful But Dangerous (1955).
