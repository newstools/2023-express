The Legend of Zelda Tears of a Kingdom and Advance Wars 1+2: Reboot Camp are the latest games rumoured to make an appearance at the first Nintendo Direct event for 2023. Nintendo typically holds a Direct conference early in the year, usually focusing on games launching in the first half of the year. In addition to rumours of a new Metroid Prime 4 reveal, it looks like Nintendo could give fans a fresh look at the upcoming Zelda and Advance Wars games. According to a post on Famiboards, Nintendo recently assigned new ID numbers to The Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom and Advance Wars 1+2. As the post points out, Nintendo often updates NSUIDs before opening pre-orders on the eShop. While it's no guarantee of an imminent Nintendo Direct, it certainly ties in to recent rumours that a Direct conference is coming soon. Advance Wars 1+2 was originally scheduled to launch in 2022. However, the game was delayed due to the war in Ukraine. "Command an army in strategic, turn-based combat as a tactical adviser for the Orange Star Army," reads the official Advance Wars description. "Your expertise is needed as you move land, air and naval units across the battlefield. Take down enemy squads and capture towns and bases to secure victory and keep the peace. "Keep an eye on the game-changing terrain and weather as you lead a variety of units across multiple maps. This remake features two campaigns that cover the events of Advance Wars and Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising!" Tears of the Kingdom, on the other hand, is a direct sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. According to the official description, the game will shift the action to the skies above Hyrule. Link will also have a host of new abilities, including being able to move through solid ground. Perhaps some additional gameplay features will be shown during the rumoured Direct. Another game tipped to make an appearance is Metroid Prime Trilogy, which will reportedly feature updated visuals and controls.
