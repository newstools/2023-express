The UK transitioned out of the European Union two years ago after Britons voted to leave the bloc 52 percent to 48 percent in 2016. But now, 65 percent of Britons support a repeat of the Brexit referendum, according to a new Savanta survey for The Independent. The poll also shows that a majority believe the UK’s global influence and ability to control its own borders have got worse since the nation broke ties with the bloc two years ago. But would you support a second referendum on the UK’s relationship with the European Union? Vote in our poll.    The number in favour of another vote is up 10 percent, compared to the 55 percent in support this time last year. Chris Hopkins, from Savanta, claimed that many may have overestimated the potential benefits of Brexit in the ballot six and a half years ago. He explained: “It’s hard to imagine being in the EU would solve any of the country’s current economic issues, but perceptions matter.” READ MORE: Labour Shadow Minister claims UK will join EU 'again' Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran commented: “It’s no wonder that the British public feels this way, when the Conservatives have gone out of their way to make it harder for smaller businesses to trade with our neighbours, for farmers to sell their produce overseas, and for scientists to cooperate with their counterparts.” A Government spokesperson said of the results: “We are taking full advantage of the many benefits of Brexit, and are restoring the UK’s status as a sovereign, independent country that determines its own future. We have taken back control of our borders, restored domestic control over our law-making and axed numerous pieces of bureaucratic red tape, saving businesses and consumers money across the country.” So what do YOU think?
