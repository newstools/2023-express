Carol Vorderman, 62, put her fabulous figure on display in a skintight outfit as she reminded fans to listen to her new podcast, Perfect 10. The former Countdown star, who just launched the second episode of her podcast, could be seen in a slow motion video moving her hips from side to side. Carol slipped into some black leggings and a figure-hugging leopard print shirt, while adding some extra height with a pair of heeled boots. The TV star smiled as she looked back in surprise after swaying her hips with her back to the camera.
