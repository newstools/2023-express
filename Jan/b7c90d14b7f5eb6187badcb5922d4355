A top-drawer cast includes Natascha McElhone as hotel owner Bella, Lily Frazer as glamorous Claudine, and Assad Zaman as dishy doctor Anish Sengupta. It also stars period drama favourite Adam James as misbehaving Jack Turner.  “The script ticked every box,” said Band of Brothers star Adam, 50. “Young love, interracial love, gay love, fascism, domestic abuse, romance, tragedy… I knew we’d have fun!” The show chronicles the lives of a group of strangers who meet at the hotel at a time of rising fascism. And for fans missing the glamour and intrigue of Downton, actress Anna Chancellor promised her role would give viewers a Maggie Smith-style fix.  The 57-year-old, who previously played Lady Anstruther in hit series, said: “Lady Latchmere was a lot of fun to play, a battleaxe with a really annoying opinion on everything. “I can’t say I agreed with her on anything much. “But if you’re that different to your character, it unlocks a different side of you.”
