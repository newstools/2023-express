Wordle 587 is live for the next 24-hours, so it's worth jumping in quickly, especially if you're building up quite the winning streak. If you need a little help solving Wordle 587 for January 27, then head to the bottom of the page for a selection of spoiler-free hints and clues. Good luck, because you might just need it. The perfect game to play over breakfast or lunch, the aim of Wordle is to figure out a five letter word in just six guesses. To solve the puzzle, you'll need to pay close attention to the colour of the tiles. If the tile turns grey, then the letter you've guessed doesn't appear in the final word. If it turns yellow, then the letter appears in the word, just not in that position. A green tile means the letter is in the word and in the correct place. An addictive game with a huge following, Wordle would go on to spawn dozens of clones. There's a Lord of the Rings themed Wordle called Lordle, a musical variant called Heardle, and a hardcore Wordle game called Quordle - where the aim is to guess four words instead of just one. If you're not great with words, then you'll prefer something like Nerdle, where you've got to figure out a maths equation.
