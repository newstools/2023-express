An 11-year-old Jude Kofie received an incredible surprise late last year after a piano suddenly showed up at his house one day. The boy, who never knew how to play a piano suddenly started playing a keyboard while sitting in his basement.  His father was left surprised when he saw his autistic son playing the piano without ever having a lesson. No one taught him how to play, but Isaiah, his father, then got Jude a larger keyboard to see what more he could do. Talking about his musical talent, Jude told CBS: “It's a miracle.”   "You think it's a miracle?" CBS News asked Jude. He responded: "That's what I prefer.” Bill Magnusson, a piano tuner saw a local news story about Jude and heard him play. CBS reported that Mr Magnusson got to know about Jude's parents and that they immigrated from Ghana.

Mr Magnusson said: "What resources are left over to help this special little soul?” Using his father's inheritance, Mr Magnusson bought a $15,000 piano — estimated to be worth $45,000 — and promised to tune it once a month for the rest of his life. He's also paying for Jude to get professional lessons.
