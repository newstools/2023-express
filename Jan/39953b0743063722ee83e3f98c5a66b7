A bedridden 99-year-old has found herself levelled with criminal charges after a court demanded she appear in person to serve on a jury. The near-centenarian, from Beaconsfield, Quebec, Montreal, was unable to do so as she receives round-the-clock medical care, with Marion Lenko summoned to court despite being hard of hearing and unable to hold a conversation. Her son-in-law Edward Ritchuk believed it was "a joke" when he first received a letter demanding the 99-year-old attend court, but the "shameful" ruling was no joke. It comes as Ritchuk fears his mother-in-law will be criminally liable for not fulfilling her jury duty, although he says checks should have been made before her selection. Ritchuk said: "When I first received the letter, I thought it was a joke. "Then this week, I received a letter from the justice ministry saying that she has to appear on January 31 in court or procedures will be taken against her." Ritchuk, who was unable to find a number to contact the courts, has no idea what to do next and says he is now stuck in limbo. Ministry of Justice spokesperson Isabelle Boily said a person may be disqualified from serving as a juror under several circumstances. She added: "If so, it is possible to request an exemption or postponement of participation by completing the form received with the notice." Despite this, a criminal defence lawyer has called the decision for the court summoning a "shameful" one, and doubts whether a call to the sheriff's office to explain the situation would be enough, CBC reported. Lawyer Eric Sutton said: "From what I understand, this family tried to phone and to no avail. "Now she's facing this fear of possibly being fined or imprisoned. I saw it in the paperwork. "That's pretty tough medicine for a 99-year-old woman who is hard of hearing. Shameful."
