If you've been trying to access your Outlook emails or join Teams call this morning without any luck you are not alone. Microsoft's servers have hit major problems this morning with thousands hit by the frustrating glitch that has left services unavailable. The gremlins appear to have struck just in time for the morning rush with many left unable to access key services from 7.30am GMT. Microsoft has now updated its service status with the US company confirming that there is a major issue affecting all of its biggest platforms. "Users may be unable to access multiple Microsoft 365 services," Microsoft said on its status page. "We've received reports that the following services are impacted: Microsoft Teams, Exchange Online, Outlook, SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, Microsoft Graph. "We've identified a potential networking issue and are reviewing telemetry to determine the next troubleshooting steps." It's clearly been a massive outage with Down Detector, which monitors outages across the planet, showing over 4,000 reports at its peak. Things do appear to be improving but there are still plenty of Outlook and Teams users still suffering from the outage. Taking to social media platforms to vent their anger, one user called Michisan said: "Teams!! Outlook!! Azure!! Down!!" Whilst another name Gemma tweeted: "Outlook and Teams are down. The two key things I need to work." In its latest update - via its official Twitter 365 page - Microsoft said: "We're investigating issues impacting multiple Microsoft 365 services. Weâ€™ve isolated the problem to networking configuration issues, and we're analyzing the best mitigation strategy to address these without causing additional impact." Hopefully, a full service will be resumed soon. MORE FOLLOWS.
