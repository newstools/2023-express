 Prince Andrew's military titles and royal patronages were returned to the crown last year and the late Queen Elizabeth II ordered her second son to stop using the style of "His Royal Highness" in an official capacity. The Duke of York has now reportedly "reached an understanding" with King Charles III to pursue some business interests and would like to use his HRH title again. But do you think he should be allowed? Vote in our poll.  In a column for the Daily Mail, Ephraim Hardcastle wrote that Andrew acknowledges he will not return to royal duties or have his patronages restored but is “perplexed” about his HRH status. He wrote: “[Andrew] is said to be perplexed as to why he cannot again use the HRH title especially as he maintains that he has done nothing wrong. His trump card with mother was invariably: 'Innocent until proven guilty.'” READ MORE: Andrew wants his HRH titles back after an 'understanding' with King A source told Mr Hardcastle that Charles is resisting formally announcing a change to Andrew’s royal status. They claimed it is “more likely that he will just start using it again in a low-key way to test the waters – should he get the King's consent.” Andrew stepped back from royal duties following his Newsnight interview in November 2019 following revelations about his involvement with Jeffrey Epstein. His accuser Virginia Giuffre subsequently launched a civil sexual assault case against him which was settled out of court. Andrew has always denied the claims and his lawyers state his financial settlement did not equal admission. Last June the Telegraph reported that Andrew had been trying to get his HRH status restored. A source claimed: "Most importantly for him is his status as an HRH and ‘Prince of the Blood’ and he feels that should be reinstated and his position recognised and respected." So what do YOU think? Should Andrew be allowed to use HRH title again? Vote in our poll and leave your thoughts in the comment section below.
