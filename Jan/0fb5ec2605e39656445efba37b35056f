Australian Open commentators were left frustrated as some spectators of Novak Djokovic's second-round match continued to shout out during serves, prompting Tim Henman to suggest they should be "thrown out" while Chris Bradnam put the fans on blast and called for them to "respect them more". The Rod Laver Arena crowd prompted a rant from Australian Open commentators during Djokovic's match against Enzo Couacaud, as some fans continued to shout out during play and were warned by umpire Fergus Murphy. The fourth seed had already jokingly thanked someone who shouted out "shut up" when another member of the crowd disturbed his serve, but it continued just a few games later. As Djokovic held to go 4-1 up in the third set after losing the second, Chris Bradnam shared his thoughts on the crowd's behaviour and unleashed his frustration, calling on the tournament to control the rowdy fans.  "Youngster shouting out just as he was serving there, they’ve somehow got to get a grip on this. It’s becoming too much, it really is," he said. "Just respect them more, seriously." Turning his attention to co-commentator Tim Henman, he asked: "I don’t know what you do about it though really, Tim? I mean, he’s tried Fergus Murphy [the umpire], to ask 'can you please not call out between first and secnd serves or as they’re serving' but it continues to happen."

If they see people continuing to call out, trying to disturb play then they need to be thrown out." His words come after Aussie Open tournament director Craig Tiley threatened that anyone trying to disrupt Djokovic's matches in his return from being deported last year would be kicked out. There was no need for action to be taken during his opening round though, as the Serb received a warm reception in his first match at Melbourne Park since 2021.

They can stay away or we will kick them out.” Djokovic appeared to play up to the rowdy fans though, as he sarcastically blew kisses to the sky to show up the disruptive spectators when he took the third set.
