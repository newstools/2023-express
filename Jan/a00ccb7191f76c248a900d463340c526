Arsenal's pursuit of Myhaylo Mudryk has dominated headlines in recent days and the trend is likely to continue until the Gunners confirm his arrival, especially after Manchester United announced the signing of Wout Weghorst last night. Other Premier League clubs are also expected to be busy with Chelsea, Wolves and Leeds working on bringing in new faces. Arsenal are said to have held an interest in Mudryk since the summer and the club finally looks set to bring the Ukrainian to north London with negotiations for the player entering their final stages. United could also still add to their squad in the coming days despite the arrival of Weghorst as Erik ten Hag looks to strengthen his side for their push for the top four. It is likely any incomings may be reliant on departures however given the club's significant expenditure over the course of the season. Meanwhile, Chelsea are looking to make even more additions despite signing four in the window so far. The club have reportedly opened talks for PSV star Noni Madueke while they have also been linked with Inter Milan centre-back Milan Skrianiar. Express Sport brings you all the latest on these deals and more with the transfer window at its halfway stage.
