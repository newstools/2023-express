Another dramatic weekend of Premier League action will have left managers around the country with a better idea of what reinforcements they need to sign this month during the January transfer window. Manchester United managed to scrape a 1-0 win over Wolves, but they were reliant on Marcus Rashford coming off the bench to do the damage, and Erik ten Hag is no doubt more convinced than ever that he needs a new No.9. Elsewhere, Antonio Conte was left fuming after his Tottenham side fell to a dismal 2-0 home defeat to Aston Villa. It is clear that the ever-demanding Italian will not be satisfied unless at least two or three quality additions are made to his squad, and it will be intriguing to see whether Daniel Levy grants him his wish or not. Meanwhile, Arsenal moved seven points clear at the top of the table following an impressive 4-2 victory over Brighton. Rather than resting on their laurels, however, Mikel Arteta and co will be all too aware that this could be the best chance they will ever have to win the Premier League, and will no doubt look to splash the cash on signings that could make the difference between glory or despair. And with the likes of Liverpool, Manchester City, Chelsea, Newcastle and Leeds all most likely looking to strengthen too, we could well be in for a busy few weeks in the ever-changing, always entertaining transfer market.
