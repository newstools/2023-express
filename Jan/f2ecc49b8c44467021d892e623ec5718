With broadband bills about to rise by a record amount in the spring, now is a very good time to get the best deal possible. Many of the major UK Internet Service Providers (ISPs), including BT, TalkTalk and Virgin Media have recently announced huge upcoming increases with customers facing bills that will be over 14 percent bigger than they pay right now. With the cost of living crisis hitting wallets hard, a broadband hike will be tough to swallow but there are ways to get things back under control. BT is just one firm also offering deals in the January sales with the ISP slashing prices by a whopping 50 percent. That means homes can get online, stream movies and more for just £14.49 per month. The massive broadband discounts are available across a swathe of plans including BT's entry-level 36Mbps Fibre Essential service. If that doesn't sound quick enough, there's also money off Full Fibre 100 (NOW £17.99) and the most premium Full Fibre 900 (NOW £27.99) which offers downloads in excess of 850Mbps. As a quick guide, a 36Mbps connection will download a full HD movie in around 13 minutes, boost things to 900Mbps and that same movie can be whizzed to a TV in under 40 seconds. Additionally, BT broadband customers will receive their very own Stay Fast Guarantee, meaning that they can either receive £20 back or a free cancellation if broadband speeds aren’t what they should be.

If you are quick, you'll find that BT is offering money off TV channels including services from Sky. Thanks to access to the NOW TV platform, BT TV users can watch content from Sky Atlantic, Sky Max, and Comedy Central for just £9 per month (usually £18) which even includes full access to Netflix. Considering a Netflix Basics account costs £6.99 alone, this is a seriously tempting TV deal. Of course, like all things in life, there is a catch as the low prices are available for the first six months before increasing to the standard price for the rest of the term. That said you'll still make a significant saving with 50 percent off lasting until the summer. If it all sounds enticing, you'll need to act fast with BT confirming that the deals will all end on February 1. That's just a few days away so don't hang around if you fancy 50 percent off those monthly bills.
