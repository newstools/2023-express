Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has been branded as “hopelessly weak” by Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer for failing to immediately sack Conservative Party Chairman Nadhim Zahawi over his tax affairs. During Prime Minister’s Questions on Wednesday, January 25, he also suggested that the job of Prime Minister is “too big” for Mr Sunak. But do you think he is a “weak” leader? Vote in our poll.  Sir Keir told the House of Commons that Mr Sunak has shown through his handling of Mr Zahawi “how hopelessly weak he is – a prime minister overseeing chaos, overwhelmed at every turn”. He continued: “He can't say when ambulances will get to heart attack victims again. He can't say when the prison system will keep streets safe again. He can't even deal with tax avoiders in his own cabinet. Is he starting to wonder if this job is just too big for him?” Mr Sunak said it would have been “politically expedient” to dismiss Mr Zahawi but added that the “proper process” was for him to be investigated by his ethics adviser.
