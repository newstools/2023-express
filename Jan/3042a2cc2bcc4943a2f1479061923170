The grieving family of Lisa Marie Presley face fresh torment with a three-way legal battle tipped over custody of her teenage twin daughters. Finley and Harper, 14, are “devastated beyond words” over the sudden death of their mother – Elvis’ only child – who suffered cardiac arrest at her home in the LA suburb of Calabasas. She had shared custody with fourth husband Michael Lockwood, 61, and he is expected to go to court to seek full custody. One family source told US website TMZ: “It’ll be a cold day in hell before he gives up those children.” But other relatives told TMZ a legal challenge is likely to come from Lisa Marie’s first husband, musician Danny Keough, 58, who she divorced in 1994. They recently reconciled and he was living with her and the twins when she collapsed. Danny performed CPR until paramedics arrived. One source said: “He sees himself as the stepfather of those kids. There’s a ton of bad blood between Keough and Lockwood, and there are rumblings within the family he might fight to get custody of the kids.” There is also “talk” among relatives that Lisa Marie’s mum Priscilla, 77, will make a legal move for the twins. The family – including Danny and guitarist Michael – gathered at Priscilla’s home on Thursday night after Lisa Marie, 54, was pronounced dead at West Hills Hospital.
