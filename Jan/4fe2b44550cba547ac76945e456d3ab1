Madonna's daughter put on a very risque display as she took to Instagram to show off her revealing black shredded dress, full of cut-outs, exposing her gym-honed figure. The unique dress barely covered her body, exposing her ample assets and curves as well as leaving her underwear on full display. Lourdes was sure to show off her outfit from all angles as she shared several photos with her 452,000 Instagram followers. This comes as her mother Madonna announced her 40th-anniversary comeback tour, including a total of 36 gigs, with two in London.
