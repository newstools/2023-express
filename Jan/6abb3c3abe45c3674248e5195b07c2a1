The zany show hit screens on Sunday for series four, and opening the show was a celebrity hidden under a unique costume which represented knitting. They appeared to have a northern accent and managed to impress the judges with their singing, but it didn't take too long for viewers of the ITV competition to start putting together the clues and theorise who was Knitting really was, and an overwhelming number of fans predicted it was, in fact, Steps icon Claire Richards. Knitting was wrapped by huge pink and blue threads and gave away a few clues as to who they could be. It seemed to be the singing voice that cemented the main prediction, though. Fans swooped in on social media to share their predictions that the former band member was definitely Knitting, with Twitter user @VikkiJane writing: "This sounds like Claire from Steps trying to disguise her voice a bit? but the tone ... it's her? #maskedsinger #TheMaskedSinger." @lifl92 added: "Knitting is 100% Claire Richards #TheMaskedSinger #MaskedSinger."

It HAS to be #TheMaskedSinger." @JayHWarne tweeted: "Naw, I'm hearing Claire Richards's voice in this. She isn't hiding her voice that well either #TheMaskedSinger."  The first episode of the series will see six of the 12 contestants take to the stage hoping to stay anonymous by impressing the judges. As well as Knitting, the group on Sunday included Ghost, Otter, Jellyfish, Phoenix and duo Cat and Mouse. Sadly, Knitting lost their round and found themselves in the bottom three of the night. There are plenty more bizarre characters to come though, with week's episode introducing see , Jacket Potato, Piece of Cake, Pigeon, Rhino and Rubbish perform. Joel Dommet was back to host the popular show, while judges Davina McCall, Rita Ora, Jonathan Ross and comedian Mo Gilligan also returned. DON'T MISS...

They didn't seem to agree with fans though, with no mention of Claire. "I think they said they're crafty, is it someone who's done a TV show with crafts, like Blue Peter?" Jonathan suggested before adding: "Could it be Konnie Huq?" Davina, meanwhile, picked up on a Lancastrian accent. She guessed that actress Jane Horrocks was disguising herself as Knitting. Joel promised the series would be the "most bizarre" yet. Last year, Jonothan was crowned "top detective" after guessing the most celebrities correctly. Rita vowed at the start of the instalment that she would reclaim the title from her colleague. The Masked Singer continues next Saturday at 6.30pm on ITV.
