As we head in to 2023, some of us may still be working through clearing the house of the last of the Christmas bits and getting a head start on the Spring cleaning mentality - including the leftover food and drink. However, whilst we may be forced to throw away any nibbles or drinks that have gone off, Southern Water has warned against pouring any leftover Baileys down your kitchen sink. As RSVP Live, writes, 'why would anyone be throwing out Baileys?!' and I'm inclined to agree. However, unlike other alcoholic drinks, Baileys has a much shorter shelf life which can lead to parts of it being poured away if it isn't drunk in time. In which case, you should be carefulas disposing of it in the wrong way can cause more damage than you think. Apparently we could be doing serious damage by ridding any excess or unwanted Baileys by pouring it down the sink as it can easily clog our drains. Whether you are disposing of an old out of date bottle or you simply couldn’t finish it, be sure to throw it away properly. Southern Water warned customers to prevent blocking their pipes in the aftermath of the holidays as many of the festive food and drink is extra rich and food waste can be high. “Something like Baileys, which has a cream content could add to problems. No one likes a nasty surprise over the festive season and a blocked drain is no different." They warn. “This is the time of year where we do see an increase in blockages, and so many of these can be easily avoided. Blocked sewers can cause flooding to homes and unclogging them can take a lot of time and effort.   Foods like curry are also on the warning list because of its high oil content. Fat, oil and grease should be left to cool in a container and disposed in the food bin and never poured down the drain. They warned that 250 tonnes of fat can enter sewage systems for every million turkeys cooked over the holidays.
