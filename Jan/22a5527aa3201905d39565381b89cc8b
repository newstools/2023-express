Bryan Kohberger is set to make his second court appearance in Idaho today. He is accused of the murder of four friends and students last year who were brutally stabbed to death following a night out. Kohberger, 28, is being held without bail in Latah County jail in Idaho. He faces four counts of first degree murder and one count of felony burglary. He will appear in court for a hearing at 8am local time (4pm GMT). The four friends were found dead in the sleepy college town of Moscow, Idaho on November 13, just over the border from Washington State University where Kohberger was a PHD candidate in Criminology. Ethan Chapin, 20; Xana Kernodle, 20; Madison Mogen, 21; and Kaylee Goncalves, 21, were seen out just hours before they were slain. Bryan Kohberger was arrested after a lengthy investigation. Police finally caught a break in the case when DNA was found on a knife sheath left at the students apartment. One of the surviving roommates also saw a masked figure in the house shortly after 4am, police believe the four friends were killed between 4am - 4.25am.  FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
