Selena, 30, hit back at online trolls who wrote nasty comments about her weight, despite oozing confidence and joy as she posed for cameras at the Golden Globes. Taking it upon herself to address critics of her physical appearance, the actress expressed a refreshingly positive attitude. Speaking in an Instagram Live yesterday alongside her little sister Grace Teefey, she told her followers: “I’m a little bit big right now because I enjoyed myself during the holidays.” “Right?”, she asked Gracie. The youngster appeared to agree, but all Selena could do was laugh. “But we don’t care,” she added, bursting into a cackle.
