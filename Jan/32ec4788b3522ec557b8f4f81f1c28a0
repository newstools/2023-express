Arsenal have already made two signings in the January transfer window but Mikel Arteta is far from finished in terms of improving his squad with the clock ticking down to the transfer deadline. The Gunners are still hoping to bring in a central midfielder ahead of the deadline, while some outgoings are expected from the Emirates Stadium before the window shuts at 11pm. The north London outfit have been trying for days to find an agreement with Brighton over Ecuador international Moises Caicedo, with the 21-year-old understood to be keen on a move to join the Premier League leaders. However, Arsenal have seen two bids knocked back for the Â£75m-rated midfielder, and it remains to be seen whether a deal can be reached. If Arteta is unsuccessful in luring Caicedo to the capital, the Spaniard has a few aces left up his sleeve. Chelsea midfielder Jorginho is thought to have been 'seriously considered' as a target with the Italy international out of contract in June, while Everton's Amadou Onana is an option should the Gunners fail in their attempts to sign him. It promises to be a busy day in N7 with several departures and more arrivals still possible as the final day of the transfer window beckons.
