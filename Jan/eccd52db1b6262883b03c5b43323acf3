Chessington World of Adventures Resort is set to introduce its first rollercoaster in 17 years after announcing that World of Jumanji will open this spring. The Surrey Theme Park and Zoo will include the world's only Jumanji rollercoaster.    The planet’s first Jumanji-themed land will also feature two other new rides. World of Jumanji will see families follow in the footsteps of Dr. Bravestone to locate the Jaguar’s Eye Jewel, lift the curse, and save Jumanji, reports Hull Live. The first adventure, the rollercoaster Mandrill Mayhem, will sweep riders up in the long arms of a mandrill as the horde whisks riders around the sites of Jumanji while dodging the hazards of the jungle. The mandrills will launch at full speed through the treetops, flipping upside down on a hair-raising adventure and spiralling to the summit of the 55-foot-tall Jaguar Shrine before falling and braving the adventure again... backwards. Mandrill Mayhem is a winged, launch shuttle ride with an inversion, which is a first for Chessington, which last added a rollercoaster in 2004. Two further adventures in the World of Jumanji will await families: Mamba Strike and Ostrich Stampede. The single largest investment in Chessington’s history, World of Jumanji will also feature a maze of pathways, some trickier to navigate than others, based on the iconic Jumanji board game. There will also be themed food, drink, and merchandise available. Six new Jumanji-themed bedrooms will be introduced to the Chessington Safari Hotel as well. Scott O’Neil, CEO of Merlin Entertainments, which operates Chessington, said: "Families should prepare to be turned upside down… literally, as the first new rollercoaster in nearly 20 years at the resort has a twist, turn and flip that will have you holding on to your seat."
