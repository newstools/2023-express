Alex Scott, 38, looked fabulous as she emerged from the swimming pool in a new series of pictures from her tropical getaway. The BBC pundit has been enjoying a well-deserved break away from work and shared earlier this week a sneak peak in view of her 1.7 million Instagram followers. In the pictures, Alex could be seen smiling from ear to ear as she enjoyed a dip in the pool while making the most of the sunshine. For her relaxing poolside day, Alex chose a snakeskin print triangle bikini that she teamed with a black bucket hat. The former Lioness paired the swimwear with a pair of dark maxi glasses, while wearing her long locks down to frame her face.
