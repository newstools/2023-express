A pensioner has resorted to shooting rats with an air rifle after they "infested" his home. Myfyr Owens, who has been left close to tears by the situation, began finding rats in his bathroom around 18 months ago and more recently in his garden.   The 76-year-old from Llanrwst, Wales, says the rodents' noises keep him awake at night and that the situation is so severe that he can even smell them. Mr Owens, who has lived in his flat on Station Road for around 15 years, told North Wales Live: "It's at night I can hear them when it's quiet. They're in the walls. It's like a golf driving range at night - clack - clack - clack. I can also smell the ammonia from their droppings. Sometimes I feel like crying." The retired school caretaker said about 18 months ago he found one rat on his towel in his bathroom and also sitting on his cistern after they came through a hole in the wall. His housing association blocked it off, he said.   In recent days, he says he spotted one in his garden and shot it with his air rifle. He caught another one by tempting it with a piece of liver and trapping it in a cage. Mr Owens said the whole ordeal has left him wanting to leave the home that he has occupied for the last decade and a half. He added: "I don't want to stop paying my rent but I want somewhere decent to live. I just want to move." A Grwp Cynefin spokesman said it had a report about the rats at Mr Owens' home on November 25 last year and sent out a pest controller to deal with them. It has not had any formal reports of rats from him since that time.
