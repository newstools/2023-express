Dramatic footage has emerged of a bus which burst into flames on a high street in Greater Manchester this morning. Pictures and videos captured a bus on fire, prompting emergency services to cordon off a stretch of the street as fire crews and police officers attended the scene. It has not yet been confirmed whether anyone has been left injured in the incident.  In a statement, a Greater Manchester Police spokesperson explained that: "At around 8:30am this morning (Thursday 5 December 2023), officers were called to reports of a bus on fire on Ashley Road in Hale. "Emergency services attended the scene. All passengers left the vehicle safely and no injuries were reported. "A road closure remains in place while further enquiries take place and the area is made safe." Footage from the scene, posted online by the Manchester Evening News, captured the blaze as clouds of smoke rose up towards the sky.   Reporter, John Scheerhout, said after speaking to witnesses: "I’m told everyone got off before the fire took hold. One shop worker has said they heard a bang and felt the building shudder." One witness told him: “I was looking through the window and there was smoke billowing up. Next thing it was in flames. It was crazy. It went up really quickly.” We'll be bringing you the very latest updates, pictures and video on this breaking news story.   Please check back regularly for updates on this developing story.
