 Innes FitzGerald, 16, told British Athletics the “reality of the travel fills me with deep concern”. The record-breaking runner was due to go the World Cross Country Champ­ion­ships in Bathurst, Australia, next month. But, like environmental activist Greta, she will not fly.    Innes said in her letter: “To have the opportunity to compete for Great Britain in Australia is a privilege. When I started running, the prospect of competing in the World Cross Country Champ­ionships would have seemed merely a dream. “However, the reality of the travel fills me with deep concern. I would never be comfortable flying in the knowledge that people could be losing their livelihoods, homes and loved ones as a result. “The least I can do is voice my solidarity with those suffering on the front line of ­climate breakdown.” Innes, from Devon, set a UK under-17 record for last month in Turin. But her refusal to fly meant it took her 20 hours to get to northern Italy.
