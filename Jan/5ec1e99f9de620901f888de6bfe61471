  In the latest clip, Paddy could be seen strolling down the aisles of a Tesco store, again covering his face with an Instagram filter. The former Take Me Out host looked bald in the video, but also had a striking, dark beard. He stopped to take a selfie with a similar-looking employee, who put his thumbs up,  prompting Paddy to caption the clip: “Nice to see our kid. #doppleganger.” Fans took to the comments section to share their thoughts on the video, with @sandraknowles57 writing: "Oh stop paddy." @donna_hendren wrote: "Paddy is having a melt/midlife. Sorry r kid but that beard is too dark with a complete bald barber." "There’s an imposter among us,” joked @larissarossiter1993, while @imonthatdumbshi commented: "Twins. Nice one for braving the shave Paddy."
