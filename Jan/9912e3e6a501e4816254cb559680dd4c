The January transfer window is now in full swing and the majority of Premier League clubs are hard at work behind closed doors to put their plans for the mid-season market into action. Just shy of £300million was spent by teams in England's top flight in January earlier this year and it seems as though a similar collective outlay could be splashed on new players over the coming weeks as managers up and down the country look to prepare their ranks for the all-important run-in. Manchester United are yet to make any confirmed signings but this could be set to change by the end of the day, with the Red Devils widely expected to announce the capture of Jack Butland on loan from Crystal Palace. Erik ten Hag is also looking to land a striker before the transfer window slams shut and is thought to be active on a number of fronts, with Joao Felix and Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting said to be among the names under consideration at Old Trafford. Arsenal, meanwhile, have also been tipped to splash the cash before the end of the month and are still trying to strike a deal with Shakhtar Donetsk for the services of long-term target Mykhaylo Mudryk over the next few weeks. The likes of Liverpool and Manchester City will also be looking to ramp up their transfer activity over the next few days, but it remains to be seen which club will manage to take the biggest strides over the course of the window.
