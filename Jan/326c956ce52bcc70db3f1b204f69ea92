More than 40 tornadoes have been reported in the US in America’s record breaking winter storm. A total of 43 tornado reports were tallied by the National Weather Service’s Storm Prediction Centre from Monday through Wednesday, with more on the way. The figures mean this month, despite only being six days in, has already pushed past the average in the US. According to the Weather Company, over the last 20 years, an average of 32 tornadoes have occurred in the US in January, the fewest of any month but just below to December and February. A January record of 212 tornadoes hit the US in 1999, and there have also been years without a single January tornado, most recently in 2003. Severe storms cut a devastating path across the US, from Arkansas and Louisiana to South Carolina, even reaching the Midwest. Outside of the tornado threat, flooding is widespread, with Arkansas on Wednesday seeing 24 highways closed due to high water. The storms in the south and midwest comes alongside, but separate to, a bomb cyclone striking California. The lethal atmospheric path has brought gale force winds and record smashing rains, and has so far killed two. As the pressure system begins to push over the West into the country, AccuWeather has said there is a chance for a large Atlantic coast storm next week. AccuWeather Lead Long-Range Meteorologist Paul Pastelok said to the agency’s website: “As more energy from the Western states feeds eastward and provided a stronger dip in the jet stream forms inland from the Atlantic coast next week, a more substantial winter storm may evolve for the Northeast with areas of rain and heavy snow. “The window for that is looking to be around Jan. 11 or 12 at this time." Meanwhile, California is set for another storm from Sunday to Tuesday, brining potentially the highest amount of rain focused on central portions of California.
