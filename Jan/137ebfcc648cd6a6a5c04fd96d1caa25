NHS strikes are set to go ahead this week after an NHS pay summit ended today with no breakthrough. The latest update comes despite hopes that nurses could be given a one-off cash payment to fend off strike action. Ambulance workers are set to walk out in Trusts across England this Wednesday and on January 23, and nurses are expected to follow on January 18-19. A source told the Mirror that no cash offer was made, despite speculation that the Prime Minister would provide one this winter to bring the strikes to an end. They also said there was no firm statement of what is on the table for 2023/24. Unite negotiator Onay Kasab blasted the approach as an "insult" saying: "The government have missed yet another opportunity to put this right. "All the government are interested in is saying in order to justify a payment, we need to come up with productivity savings in the NHS." He added: "All the government are interested in is saying in order to justify a payment, we need to come up with productivity savings in the NHS. "That is absolutely ludicrous. This isn’t a factory we’re talking about. "We’re talking about people who are working well beyond their contracted hours anyway just to get the job done."  Speaking ahead of the meetings, Mr Sunak said: "People need to get talking, that's what they're doing, hopefully we can find a way through this." In an interview on the Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Mr Sunak said: "We want to have a reasonable, two-way conversation about pay and everything else that is relevant." Ahead of the talks, Pat Cullen, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, had said Mr Sunak's remarks offered a "chink of optimism". She added: "The prime minister talked about coming to the table. Now that's a move for me." But she said the talks are "not going to avert the strike action" in England on January 18 and 19 without compromise on 2022/23 pay.
