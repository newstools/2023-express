Olivia Holland-Rose wants to spare other families the devastation of learning that their pet has been hit by a car and left for dead. She has now secured a Parliamentary debate for the issue to be discussed tomorrow at Westminster Hall. Under present rules, people are required to tell the police if they drive into dogs, horses, cattle, pigs, goats, sheep, donkeys or mules - but not cats. Drivers face a fine of up to Â£5,000 if they do not report an incident. Campaign group CatsMatter wants people to face a "substantial fine" if they fail to report a collision with a cat. And it added it would rather people reported it to a vet than the police. Olivia and husband Chris lost their beloved cat D'Artagnan last January. She launched a petition which has been signed by more than 102,000 people, securing the debate. The star, currently an understudy in The Phantom of the Opera, was grief-stricken at the death of her pet and horrified his body had been left on the roadside. Olivia said: "If it hadn't been for a Good Samaritan who found him and knocked on doors until he found who he belonged to, we'd never have known. "I was so shocked anyone would leave an animal on the side of the road, particularly when it's so clearly a domestic pet."  Mandy Hobbis of CatsMatter said: "Our primary goal is to preserve life prevent suffering and simply have a bit of decency legislated for. "Most people will agree it can't be right that drivers can legally run over cats and leave them scared, in pain, or worse, at the roadside. "We understand accidents happen and we don't want to penalise good drivers, just morally bankrupt ones." Conservative MP Rehman Chishti said he wants to see a "parity of esteem between a dog and a cat". "They are both a loved part of people's families," he said.
