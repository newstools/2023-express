NFL icon JJ Watt was left in floods of tears after his Arizona Cardinals team-mates surprised him with an emotional tribute video - featuring a hilarious message from Tom Brady. Watt played his final game in the NFL last weekend, with the Cardinals missing out on the play-offs. Watt ended his ten-year NFL career by recording two sacks against the San Francisco 49ers, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest defensive players ever. With his final game approaching, his team-mates decided to arrange a special surprise for him to mark the occasion. Cardinals interim head coach Vance Joseph interrupted his own pre-game team meeting to play a video put together by his team-mates with a string of messages from individuals around the NFL. Brady, Aaron Rodgers, Peyton Manning, his two brothers TJ Watt and Derek Watt, as well as the NFL star's parents. Brady used his time to crack a joke at his former adversary, saying: "Man, you were a pain in my a** for a long time! It was an honour to share the field with you." Rodgers declared he was looking forward to seeing Watt enter the Pro Football Hall of Fame, saying: "Congratulations, buddy, see you in Canton!" Watt tweeted after the video clip was released by HBO: "Was not ready for that whatsoever. Truly one of the greatest gifts Iâ€™ve ever received. Will cherish it forever." Unsurprisingly, Watt was overcome with emotion after watching the video, and broke down in tears after his wife and son appeared on the screen. His wife, Kealia, said: "It has been such an honor to watch you work your ass off these past years and do whatever you needed to do to be the best. You've always been so generous and kind and loving to everybody around you, and you never forgot who you are. I know Koa will be so proud to be your son."
