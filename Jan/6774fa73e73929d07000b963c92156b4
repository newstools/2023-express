Breaking the shock news they said: “Michael Flatley has been diagnosed with an advanced form of cancer. “He has undergone surgery and is in the care of an excellent team of doctors. “No further comments will be made at this time. We ask only for your prayers and well wishes.” American-born Michael recently wrote, directed, produced and starred in the spy film Blackbird.  The performer has homes in Britain, France, Ireland and the US. But he mostly lives in France and the UK – where his entertainment empire is based. He is now understood to be recuperating with the support of his dancer wife, Niamh O’Brien, and son, Michael Junior, 15. It is unclear if the Riverdance star’s diagnosis is linked to his treatment in 2003 for skin cancer. At that time, he said he owed his life to a keen-eyed MTV viewer who had spotted the first signs of Michael’s malignant melanoma “purely by chance”.  The dancer admitted that he’d had no idea he was suffering from the disease and said finding out was “a frightening place to be”. Michael has been a consistent supporter of cancer charities. News of his latest illness was also broken in a post to his “Dear Friends”on his Instagram page. The message appeared along with a black and white photo of the dancer, standing on a beach and looking out to sea. Fans added their messages of support to the post. One wrote: “Sending my best wishes and prayers to the legend.”
