Sir Jake Berry has recalled the terrifying moment that a stalker turned up at his home, claiming she was having his baby and wanted to run away with him. Sir Jake said the woman, who he said had travelled from the North East of England, had a “fixation” with him. He detailed the darker sides of being an MP during an interview with broadcaster Gloria De Piero on GB News.He said: “She claimed that she was having my baby, claimed that we were getting married."She came to our house, was sort of at the end of the lane with a suitcase waiting to run away with me or whatever she had in her mind.”Sir Jake said the woman had also racked up a “huge hotel bill” in his Lancashire constituency, telling the staff she was working for him.The former Chairman of the Conservative Party also touched on his battle with depression and how his wife — a former aide to Boris Johnson — dealt with post-natal depression during the chat.The couple have three children together and live in Rossendale. Speaking of his time serving during Liz Truss' premiership, Sir Jake said that Rishi Sunak should have held an “endorsement vote” to show he had the support of the membership.Mr Sunak’s appointment came only weeks after he had come second to Ms Truss in the summer leadership contest. Sir Jake added: “I actually think it’s a great pity for Rishi Sunak that we didn’t have a vote of members."Because in the summer, fine Conservative that he is, he struggled actually to get the support of Conservative Party members — as, funnily enough, did Jeremy Hunt in the previous leadership election.“And I think even though he absolutely got the majority of the Conservative Members of Parliament — and I support him as Prime Minister in everything he does — the challenge he has is, even if it’s not true, there’s a perception of the Conservative Parliamentary Party now being disconnected from our membership.” Sir Jake said he thought Mr Sunak “would have won it well” if he had asked the membership to vote to endorse him but, instead, a narrative has been allowed to develop about members being “denied that vote”.The former minister also detailed how, in the final days of the Truss premiership, he was part of a “war room” in No 10.He is said to have been locked in with ex-chief whip Wendy Morton and former deputy prime minister Therese Coffey — in a bid to stabilise her leadership following the disastrous mini-budget.
