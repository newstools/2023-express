Apple Martin, 18, is the eldest daughter of Gwyneth Paltrow and her ex-husband Chris Martin. The up-and-coming star looked the image of her famous mother as she took her seat on Tuesday at the Chanel Couture fashion show at the Grand Palais Ephemere for Paris Fashion Week. Apple sported a textured mini-dress with a black and white checked pattern, alongside a plain black panel. She added a matching cardigan to the look, which she draped over her shoulders. The budding singer had her blonde locks left to fall in a slight wave, as she added bold black winged eyeliner.
