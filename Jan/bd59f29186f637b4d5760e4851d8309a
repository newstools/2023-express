King Charles has reportedly refused to discuss with friends bombshell allegations made by Prince Harry in his memoir Spare. Last week Harry told the Telegraph there could have been two books, raising the possibility of another title and more revelations about the Windsors. Mr Bower, writing in the Daily Mail, said no one knows more than the monarch how Harry has "barely scratched the surface" when it comes to King Charles's marriage to Diana, Princess of Wales, and his romance with Camilla. The author also claimed King Charles's silence over the book's claims is in part driven by self-awareness that he did not support his sons enough after their mother was killed in a car crash. Mr Bower insisted in his op-ed that it was no surprise to him to hear of a "mooted peace summit" between the King and the Sussexes, with "sources" at the palace suggesting the sovereign might ignore Harry's "treachery" and seek reconciliation. The possibility of a second book will have given palace officials "the most pause" as they fear more "embarrassing revelations" and "vitriolic accusations" from Harry, according to Mr Bower.
