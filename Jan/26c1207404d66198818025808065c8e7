Massive plumes of smoke are billowing over west London this evening after a fire erupted next to the M25 motorway in Slough. The blaze is thought to have erupted near the Iver Golf Club and Driving Range close to Slough Canal. Photographs taken at the scene show a huge fire, producing vast quantities of smoke, at a compound near the Langley train and Elizabeth line station. Flames were visible from houses in the streets surrounding the scene. Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service (RBFRS) tweeted: "RBFRS are currently tackling a serious fire in a commercial unit on Station Road, Langley. "Crews are making good progress and expect to be scaling back their operation shortly. "The public are encouraged to avoid the area if possible." Express.co.uk has approached RBFRS for more details.
