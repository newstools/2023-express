Tottenham managing director Fabio Paratici has been hit with a 30 month ban from football by the Italian Football Federation following an investigation into 'false accounting' and 'market manipulation' at Juventus. Paratici previously worked at the Serie A giants for 11 years as chief football officer. And he has now been punished along with Juventus, who have been slapped with a 15 point deduction from the powers-that-be. It is not yet clear, however, whether the ban for Paratici is applicable in English football or only in Italy. Juventus' former chairman Andrea Agnelli, meanwhile, has been banned for two years, while ex-vice chairman Pavel Nedved was given an eight-month ban. A statement released on Friday evening read: "The Federal Court accepted the request for the revocation of the leakage process, filed by the Figc Prosecutor, and thus reopened a sports proceedings against Juventus.  "The ANSA learns that. Sanctions only for Juve and its executives, cut off the other clubs. The FIGC Court also decided two and a half years of inhibition for Paratici, two years for Agnelli and Arrivabene, 1 year and 4 months for (Federico) Cherubini, 8 months for Nedved." Previous to the trial, Paratici had spoken about his feelings about the situation. He told Football Italia: "Right now, I am not ready, I am a bit upset, and it bothers me to talk about this. Honestly, a few things are not quite clear, and I want to remain quiet; I am still not ready." As a result of Juventus' points deduction, the giants of European football have slipped down from third to tenth place in Serie A. And they are now in danger of missing out on European football for next season. Paratici has been an instrumental figure since moving to Spurs, and was key in bringing in the likes of Dejan Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur in from Juventus, along with brokering a deal to sign Argentinean centre-back Cristian Romero from Atalanta.
