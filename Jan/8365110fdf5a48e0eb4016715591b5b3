For those looking for a new skincare routine to start the year, Boots is helping by slashing prices on top skincare products. With many looking to update their skincare and tackle signs of ageing, shoppers can buy affordable products which still have an impact on the appearance of skin.   One of the anti-ageing products available for £10 is the L’Oreal Paris Revitalift Laser Advanced Anti-Ageing Serum which contains Hyaluronic Acid to re-plump wrinkles, and has Pro-Xylane™ 3% and Pro Ceramide to smooth the appearance of skin. The serum was originally £27.99, but shoppers can save £17.99 by buying it in the £10 sale. Another product included is the No7 Advanced Ingredients Vitamin C & E Facial Capsules 30s, which contains antioxidants for radiant, hydrated skin. The capsules are usually £19.95, but they're 50 percent cheaper in the Boots sale. To target the eye, the Olay Eyes Ultimate Eye Cream has three in one benefits to help reduce dark circles, wrinkles and puffiness with a colour-correcting formula.
