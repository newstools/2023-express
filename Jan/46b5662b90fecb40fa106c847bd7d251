Manchester United are in Premier League action against Manchester City today. However, that doesn't mean transfer speculation has gone quiet at Old Trafford. Wout Weghorst and Jack Butland have moved to the club so far this month, with the former's move from Burnley announced on Friday. Erik ten Hag has raised eyebrows with his decision to sign Weghorst. However, he’s explained the call to club media by saying: “He is a striker, and we had an open position there to fill in. “I think in the balance of the offensive [players], he really fits in. I am really happy, and I don't think we had the type what he is. “Most importantly, he can score goals from everywhere and he was always a surprise at every club, in every league. That is also what I expect here. “For here, I expect a team player and someone who can link up, a player who will do his defending work and we are really happy to sign him.” Stayed tuned for the latest at Old Trafford throughout the day.
