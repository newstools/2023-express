A British Airways passenger plane has indicated an emergency onboard while flying from Glasgow to London this morning. The BA9275 flight issued a 7700 alert as the plane flew over the border between England and Scotland at 11:49am. The plane left Glasgow Airport at 11:28am on Friday, and was due to land at London Heathrow Airport for 12:14pm. But the 'Squawk 770' alert was set off about 25 minutes before the flight was due to land. These alerts are used to identify an aircraft that has a possible issue and allows it to have priority over other air traffic. A map of the plane's route shows that it circled over Manchester Airport twice just before midday. No passengers were on the flight, according to reports, as it was just a positioning flight. British Airways have confirmed that the alert was issued due to a technical issue. Pilots requested priority landing. A spokesperson said: "Our pilots requested a priority landing in Manchester as a precaution due to a minor technical issue, and the aircraft landed normally." The plane was able to land normally at the airport. A spokesperson for Manchester Airport confirmed the flight had landed at the airport but was not able to give any more information on why the flight had to be grounded.
