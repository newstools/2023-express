An attractive young woman of 27 with her handsome consort Philip, and their small children, Charles and Anne, they typified the ideal family and created a vision of royalty that lasted for decades. The coronation of Charles III and his Queen Consort, Camilla, presents a very different picture. He is 74, she is a year older, and their back story is at variance with his parents. To some, Camilla will always be the third person in Charles and Diana’s marriage. Then there are the problems over “exiled” family members and questions of who will make the traditional balcony appearance. Wise decisions have been made to focus on the monarchy’s ability to unite the nation and Commonwealth in a celebration of community and public service. There will be street parties and a day of volunteering after the coronation, and a festival atmosphere generated by a televised concert at Windsor Castle promising global superstars plus a culturally inclusive Coronation Choir. Merriment coupled with concern for others is a potent combination that suggests the personality of the King, fond of humour but who often demonstrates his wish to help the less fortunate. A PR campaign in recent times has done much to change the image of Camilla, now better known for her charitable concerns. Reflection on the monarch’s role as well as an exhibition of grandeur are key elements to the coronation which hopes to leave a legacy of happier communities.
