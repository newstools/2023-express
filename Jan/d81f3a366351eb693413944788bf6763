A mum has shared her frustration after being 'unable to book a spa day' for her and her friend - despite buying the vouchers two months ago. Angela Kissack, who works as a waitress at Bistrot Pierre in Southport, claims she has rung the spa as many as 20 times.  Angela bought two pick-and-mix vouchers for Formby Hall on November 25 last year in the hope of using them in December as a treat for her and her colleague. After buying the vouchers, she realised that they weren't valid until January, with the two friends deciding to use them on January 9. The mum-of-one told the Echo: "I tried to call them to book it for January 9 but when I rang they either said they would call me back or they would put me on hold and then it would cut off. "Now my friend has gone down to London so we're trying to book for the 25th but we've not been able to yet. If we don't use it we lose the money we spent on it because there's an expiry date. It was £69 a person for a pick and mix voucher." The 38-year-old is now worried that the voucher might expire before she can use it. According to the confirmation, Angela has until March 31, although Formby Hall has blamed technical issues for her inability to book the spa day that entitles her to two different treatments and use of the spa facilities. She added: "It was meant to be a way of relaxing. A mums on the run kind of thing."  A spokesperson from Formby Hall Golf Resort & Spa said: "We're sorry that Ms Kisseck has had difficulty contacting us to make a booking with her voucher. "Unfortunately, we have experienced a combination of technical issues with our phone lines and a higher volume of calls than normal due to guests wanting to redeem their vouchers from the festive period. If our phone line is busy, guests can also contact us by email or through our social media channels. "Our phone lines are now fixed and we’ll make contact with Ms Kisseck to book her visit."
