Equity release is often used to plug a gap for people who might have a shortfall in their pension savings as they approach, or are already enjoying, their retirement. The money that you release is tax free and can be accessed as a lump sum or smaller instalments later. Make your retirement more comfortable According to figures from Age Partnership, the UK’s No1 equity release broker*, in 2022 37 percent of their customers used equity release to pay off their mortgage. This frees up money that would have otherwise gone on monthly repayments. Once you’ve repaid any existing mortgage, you could enjoy spending the money you unlock. Maybe you’re planning on home improvements, the holiday of a lifetime, or just want to supplement your day-to-day finances? You could release from a minimum of £10,000 up to a percent of the value of your property, find out how much you could unlock with our free calculator. Find the right plan for your circumstances Due to the increased popularity of equity release, there are now eight times more plans available than just five years ago, meaning there is more choice available for a range of different personal circumstances. The most popular form of equity release, a lifetime mortgage, also allows you to continue to own 100 percent of your home. Plus, all equity release plans come with a no negative equity guarantee, which means that you can never pass on the debt to your estate, providing the property is sold for a reasonable amount. There are also plans that allow you to safeguard a percentage of your property value so that you can still pass on an inheritance to your loved ones. Is equity release right for me?
