Edwin Eugene 'Buzz' Aldrin Jr, the astronaut and engineer who helped transform human understanding of space, was born on January 20, 1930, 93 years ago. During this time he has enjoyed being one of the world's most recognisable and celebrated figures, something that was decided in 1969 when he and fellow astronaut Neil Armstrong took the first steps on the Moon as part of the history-defining Apollo 11 mission. Aldrin recalled the experience in his 2016 book, No Dream is Too High: Life Lessons from a Man Who Walked on the Moon, writing: "The sky is not the limit… There are footprints on the Moon!" Before his exploits into space, Aldrin, who was honoured by having the character Buzz Lightyear from Toy Story named after him, served in the Korean War, flying 66 combat missions, and shooting down two enemy aircraft. It earned him a Distinguished Flying Cross honour from his country. Soon after he earned a doctorate in astronautics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, paving the way for him to join NASA's space programme in October 1963. The West Point Association of Graduates described Aldrin as a "distinguished airman, scientist, astronaut and patriot" who "left an indelible mark, not only on the history of his country but also on that of the world".
