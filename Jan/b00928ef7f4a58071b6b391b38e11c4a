According to a royal expert, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were likely the "first to know" about Eugenie's special news. Since the latest royal baby news, royal expert, and editor-in-chief of Majesty Magazine, Ingrid Seward has spoken out about Eugenie's latest pregnancy. Speaking to the Mirror, Ms Seward said: "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex would have been amongst the first to hear the news of Eugenie’s pregnancy. "Meghan and Harry are close with Eugenie – and not only has she stayed with them in California, but they have been on holidays together before Harry’s marriage. "If the Sussexes come to the coronation in May, there will be an added incentive to see Eugenie as by then it is doubtful if she will want to travel herself." FOLLOW EXPRESS.CO.UK BELOW FOR UPDATES..
