The 41-year-old is determined to highlight how crucial best practice and parenting is in the development of children, particularly in the very early years of their lives and how such practice can have a significant effect on lifelong outcomes.

The little boy, dressed as a construction worker, can be seen moving over towards the front of the camera as Kate, who was standing behind, laughs.
