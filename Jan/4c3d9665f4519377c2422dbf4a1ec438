Peter Wisby, 84, and his wife Eileen, 81, from London have accused their bank of lying after it said it closed the Tower Bridge Road branch of Barclays in Bermondsey, London, because only one person was using it. The couple now have to travel two miles to their nearest branch and claim people aren't using their local branches because the banks are "putting obstacles in the way".   Barclays recently confirmed 15 more of its branches will shut down later in 2023 as more and more people bank online. However, Barclays customers will still be able to access in-person services via pop-up banks run from a support van. These services will be accessible to Barclays customers on certain dates and times of the day. More information on these can be found on the bank’s website, or, alternatively, those who have an account with Barclays can access their account through Post Office branches instead.   It's not the only high street bank to close some of its branches - banks could vanish from the high streets by 2027 as Halifax and Lloyds have also announced new closures. Industry analysts believe in-person banking will be extinct by 2027 with, Mr Stafford, a member of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Fair Business Banking, calling for something to be done. He said: “It is an absolute disgrace that they are cutting this essential lifeline off from our streets with such little care. “Lloyds has a duty of care to the local community, and this will further damage high streets and local businesses.” The MP added: “I urge them to rethink their decision, and help support great British high streets.”    Barclays branches to shut in 2023 include: Amersham (4 Sycamore Road HP6 5DT) - January 3, 2023 Ellesmere Port (100 Whitby Road CH65 0AD) - February 3, 2023 Liskeard (The Parade PL14 6AR) - February 3, 2023 Weymouth (2B St Mary Street DT4 8PB) - March 3, 2023 Dagenham (227/231 Heathway RM9 5AN) - March 3, 2023 Bridlington (6 Manor Street YO15 2RU) - June 3, 2023 Swansea (16 Newton Road, Mumbles SA3 4AU) - July 3, 2023 Sleaford (21 Market Place NG34 7SS) - August 3, 2023 Torquay (39/40 Fleet Street TQ2 5DL) - August 3, 2023 Sittingbourne (85 High Street ME10 4AW) - August 3, 2023 Birmingham (161 High Street, Kings Heath B14 7LA) - October 3, 2023.
