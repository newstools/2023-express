Chanelle Hayes, 35, looked sensational inÂ a two-piece while on a sunny getaway in Greece. The Big Brother star, who once weighed more than 17 stone, could be seen lounging on a sun bed while wearing a two-tone triangle bikini. The self-proclaimed body positivity advocate glowed as she went makeup-free and tied her short locks in a low ponytail. She embarked on an incredible weight loss journey that led her to shed nine stone - which saw her drop from a size 18 to a size 10. Chantelle has been open about undergoing a gastric sleeve operation during the summer of 2020 to help her achieve her ideal body.
