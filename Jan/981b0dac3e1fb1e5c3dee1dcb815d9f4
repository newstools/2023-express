  Rita looked sensational as she showed off her toned tummy and enviable curves in the skimpy frock, which featured a crisscross design down the side. Another snap showed the songstress in a black, lace bralette and large crucifix necklace. She wore a black, translucent skirt over some equally lacy pants and finished off the look with some matching gloves. Rita captioned the photos: “My first week of 2023 pt 1 listening to my new single every day!! I can’t wait for you all to hear it! #youonlyloveme.” (sic)
