King Charles is facing a two-fold dilemma as the Coronation draws closer, a royal commentator has claimed. The first, Daniela Elser said, is the attendance of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex at the historic event, taking place on May 6. While a source claimed last month all members of the family "will be welcome" at the Coronation, the presence of Meghan and Prince Harry could be a distraction from the protagonists of the ceremony, Queen Camilla and King Charles, Ms Elser claimed. She wrote in the NZ Herald: "Basically, the couture-clad sideshow of the Sussexes would most likely distract the masses and the media from the King." Given the drop in popularity the Sussexes experienced in Britain recent polls have suggested, the pair's public appearance may be confronted by an adverse reaction from bystanders outside Westminster Abbey, Ms Elser continued. A second issue, Ms Elser said, concerns the Duke of Sussex's stated mission to "save [the royals] from themselves". After quoting Harry's interview with the Telegraph's Bryony Gordon, Ms Elser said: "Does any of this sound like a man who now, having thoroughly said his piece, is going to happily live a life of quiet dedication to good deeds and reading to his chickens from the collected works of Eckhart Tolle? For the Palace, they are in a serious catch-22 pickle here. If they engage directly with the Sussexesâ€™ laundry list of complaints, they will only add fuel to the media fire and prolong this storm. On the other, their policy of refusing to engage and stoically keeping their eyes forward is hardly doing them much good either if you look at the most recent polls."
