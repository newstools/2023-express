A young woman who had moved to a new city to pursue her dream - a career in filmmaking - was found dead in a canal weeks later. Charlotte Burlace-Colquhoun, 20, was described as a "kind" and "creative" individual who "loved people" at her inquest last week. The hearing was told the student was discovered in Manchester Ship Canal in Salford Quays on December 20. Charlotte had moved to the area, from her hometown Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, for a university degree in post-production TV and film in the hope to pursue a career in the industry loved. The inquest opened and was adjourned, during which police said there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding Charlotte's death. Speaking to Manchester Evening News after the hearing, Charlotte's friend Benedict McManus said: "Charlotte had just taken the massive move of leaving home and starting uni as a talented film editor. "It was the first step in her dream of moving to Manchester and the next one in her journey. Charlotte - Lottie for those that knew her - was a bright, intelligent and talented stick of dynamite." Benedict has since started up a fundraising page to help raise money to cover the cost of Charlotte's funeral, to support the family and reduce their worry about how to pay for laying her to rest. The day after her death, Charlotte's father said in a tribute: "My wife, my daughter and I love Charlotte very much and we’re already missing her. She was beautiful, intelligent, kind, creative and loved people and cats. Charl had just started at university studying ‘Post-Production for TV and Film’ and was beginning a new future with great prospects." Friends also paid heartfelt tributes, calling her "gifted' and 'talented" in film-making and editing. They added she was "one of the first people willing to help someone". The full inquest well be held at a later date in Greater Manchester.
