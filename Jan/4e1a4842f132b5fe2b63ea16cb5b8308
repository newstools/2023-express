 During her private concert on Saturday, the Queen of Pop’s daughter made a surprise appearance and even treated fans to a live performance of their duet, Brown Skin Girl. The Single Ladies singer stunned in a canary yellow dress, with tasteful ab-flashing cutouts all accessorised with a fan of yellow feathers behind her. More surprises lay in store for the crowd as Queen Bey made not one, but two, outfit changes into equally jaw-dropping looks. Shortly before her performance, the singer was steeped in controversy for accepting a $24million (£19million) payday for the concert despite the anti-LGBTQ policies of the United Arab Emirates. Other celebrities like David Beckham and Robbie Williams faced similar backlash last year for appearing in Qatar during the World Cup. On Twitter, Beyonce’s fan base erupted as critics claimed her wealth and fame had been “largely, if not entirely” gained through her “LGBTQ+ fans”. Others also argued she “doesn’t need a penny” of the paycheque, but still agreed to perform. However, many praised the singer following the concert, saying that despite her hiatus, she is still “so far beyond the current music industry's standard that it's glaringly obvious she's one of the few examples of musical excellence”. The singer’s concert marked the launch of a new luxury hotel, Atlantis The Royal, in Dubai.
