The monarch, 74, uses the initial R after his name to signify Rex, Latin for king. So his new pink tie would appear to be an in-joke and a play on Tyrannosaurus rex. He wore it yesterday on a visit with Queen Consort Camilla to Greater Manchester after it made its debut at church in Norfolk earlier this month. Palace officials were tightlipped about his new accessory but could it be perhaps a Christmas present from his grandchildren? On a busy day of official engagements, the King took the royal train for the first time in his reign yesterday, journeying from Ayr, where he had been staying at Dumfries House, to Manchester. But Camilla, who had been elsewhere, travelled separately. Before she arrived, the King went to the office of GCHQ, the signals intelligence organisation. He also visited the Kellogg’s plant in the city. As Prince of Wales, he had been there previously in 1974. Later the King was joined by Camilla on a visit to Bolton Town Hall, before heading to a community centre in Wythenshawe, Manchester. At Norbrook Community Centre, Camilla praised England footballer Marcus Rashford when she unveiled a donation of books from the striker to his former youth club. England manager Gareth Southgate, who joined the royal party in his role as an ambassador for The Prince’s Trust, also praised the player.
