Police have raced to a busing shopping centre after a 62-year-old man was stabbed this evening. Mulitple officers rushed to Salford Precinct, in Gtr Manchester, and pictures show an area of the retail park remains cordoned off at the scene of the incident. Greater Manchester Police said the man in his 60s was stabbed in the car park in Heywood Way and has been taken to hospital. Officers say they believe it was an isolated incident, the Manchester Evening News reported.  Detective Sergeant Gareth Bannister of GMPâ€™s Salford District said: "I would like to reassure the public first and foremost that this is an isolated incident, and our officers are leaving no stone unturned to locate the suspect in question. "Our officers will remain in the local area to conduct further enquiries this evening and we have an increased number of patrolling officers across the centre of Salford to provide further reassurance to our community. "If you were at Salford Precinct this afternoon, saw anything suspicious, saw the suspect in question or have any information no matter how small it may be, this could be a huge help in locating the suspect and achieving justice for the victim." Eye witnesses reported hearing sirens and after arriving at the shopping centre reported that shops had closed their shutters and that nobody could come in or leave the area. The police cordon appears to centre around a section of a car park near near Aldi and Salford Market which leads into Salford Precinct. Shoppers at the scene have described a major police presence this evening.
