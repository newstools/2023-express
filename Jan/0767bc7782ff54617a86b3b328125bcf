WARNING: This article contains spoilers from Mayor of Kingstown.Actor, writer and singer Hugh Dillon's career first started when he moved to London and started songwriting, squatting and playing music on the streets to make money. He quickly realised he had a knack for it and after a year in the UK, he moved to Toronto where he started working at a hospital, playing music for ill children. Dillon later got a record deal and is now the lead vocalist of the rock band Headstones. But the 59-year-old was determined to try something new and so pursued his other dream of acting and writing.

Opening up to Express.co.uk, Dillon explained: "I had done a movie and I had to move to Los Angeles and that guy changed my life. "I knew when I met him because he had the ability to see the character on the page, see the world, and also, he's a natural teacher. "I was getting older and I was like 'How do I transition into movies because I'm really a musician?' and we would sit down and get into it. "He would explain in depth where the character came from, what his motivations were, and he could see it surgically." For decades, Dillon had the idea of creating Mayor of Kingstown, a drama based on his hometown, revolving around the fictional character Mike McLusky (played by Jeremy Renner) who acts as a go-between police officers and prisoners. Dillon knew he wanted to see the story told in either a film or TV series format but didn't know how to go about it. He continued: "By the time I said 'I have this idea, I want to write this script, he was fascinated with the darkness and the prison system and he asked me a million questions as I'm from that town. "We just got into and instead of me doing my homework for the day, we would get lost in a conversation of creating this world and we did that for 10 years until we sold it."
