The latest stabbing comes days after a man in his 20s was knifed on a street in Carlton, Nottinghamshire. In that instance, the victim suffered serious injuries and residents were left horrified. One resident called it "the worst thing" he'd seen there in the four years he's lived on the street. Steve Weatherbed, a 58-year-old engineer, said: "This is the worst thing I’ve seen here, but there have been problems for months and months. I’ve been in contact with people about cars speeding up and down the road and there are a lot of arguments too - it’s horrific. "But it’s the first time I’ve seen so many police here. It looks serious."
