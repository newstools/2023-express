The Australian Open semi-final picture is becoming clearer as the semi-finals wrap up in Melbourne on Wednesday. Novak Djokovic and Andrey Rublev will battle it out for the final spot in the evening game, vying for the chance to join Karen Khachanov and Stefanos Tsitsipas in the final four. Tsitsipas secured passage into the semi-finals on Tuesday, easing past the Czech Republic's Jiri Lehecka in straight sets. Khachanov joined him by navigating past Sebastian Korda, taking a 7-6 6-3 3-0 lead before his American opponent retired through a wrist injury. He ruffled feathers with his post-match decision to continue supporting Artsakh, an Armenian enclave in Azerbaijan that the nation claims the latter has blockaded since December 12. Azerbaijan has called on the Armenian-Russian star to be 'punished for his provocation' after writing on the TV camera: "Keep believing until the very end. Artsakh, hold on!" In the women's draw, Magda Linette continued her dream run in Melbourne by beating Karolina Pliskova in straight sets. World number five Aryna Sabalenka also cruised past Donna Vekic to book a semi-final date with Linette. Elena Rybakina will face Victoria Azarenka in the other clash.
