Pavement parking bans are enforced by local councils and while the Highway Code advises against the practise, it is currently only illegal in London. Outside the capital, pavement parking is permitted as long as the vehicle is not causing an obstruction. Scotland is set to introduce a ban later this year, but do you think all pavement parking should be banned? Vote in our poll. Scotland agreed to ban parking on pavements and dropped kerbs in 2019 yet plans were delayed by the pandemic. However, four years later, a nationwide ban is set to be introduced in December. Vehicles parked partially or wholly on the pavement will be issued a £70 fixed penalty notice for obstructing pedestrians.

Their campaign states: “Pavements are for people to walk on - so of course parking on pavements is a major concern for our supporters and the general public.” Edinburgh Councillor Scott Arthur has pledged for the Scottish capital to introduce “zero-tolerance” measures first, ahead of a national ban. Neil Greig, policy and research director at IAM RoadSmart, warned that Edinburgh-only regulations “risk causing confusion” to motorists. England has no plans to introduce a ban at the same time but former Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said in March 2020 that London’s pavement parking rules could be extended in the future to end “very real difficulties for many pedestrians”.
