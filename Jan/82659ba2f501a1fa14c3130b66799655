A family has shared its grief as a young mother "tragically took her own life" on Christmas Day. Jordan Carter, 28, was described as a "large-than-life" woman who "loved" her nine-year-old son Kai dearly. She was discovered lifeless in her home on December 25 at around 8.30pm, one day before her birthday. Police confirmed the death is not being treated as suspicious. Jordan's mother, Cheryl Carter, has set up a fundraiser for little Kai and so far people - including strangers - have donated nearly £2,500 to support the youngster. Cheryl, from Plymouth, Devon, also wants to help people suffering with their mental health. "People do care, and if people tried reaching out, there are people willing to help," she said. Jordan had battled mental health challenges for years, her mum told Plymouth Live. Paying tribute to her daughter, Cheryl said: "Jordan was a larger-than-life character, her two loves were horses and she started riding at the age of four. And of course, her son Kai. Myself and my family are totally overwhelmed by the generosity of people, especially with times being so difficult for most financially, with rising living costs and of course Christmas, however people still did donate. Which has restored my faith in human nature. "No words could ever express my appreciation for all the donations & heartfelt messages at such a tragic time. I will be forever grateful." The GoFundMe page reads: "Hi my name is Cheryl, I'm fundraising for my grandson Kai, whose mum tragically took her own life on Christmas Day. "All donations will be put in a trust fund for him. If anyone can help no matter how little it would be very much appreciated. Many many thanks." The Samaritans can be reached round the clock, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.
