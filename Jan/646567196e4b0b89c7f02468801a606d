Catherine Zeta-Jones, 53, logged onto Instagram yesterday to share a sultry photo with her five million followers. For the snap, the actress wore a revealing gown, which alternated satin cutouts and sheer lace inserts and featured an extreme plunging neckline. The star looked breathtakingly fabulous as she posed with one hand on her hip and the other on her head, putting her famous curves on full display. Catherine could be seen closing her eyes and smiling as she admitted in the caption: “I just woke up like this and realized it’s the weekend. I am going back to bed.” The Hollywood star wished fans a happy Saturday, with her followers responding in the post’s comments section.
