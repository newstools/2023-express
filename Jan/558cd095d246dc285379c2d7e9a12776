 The first three episodes were released on December 8, the rest a week later, in the lead-up to publication of the duke’s controversial memoir Spare. Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace have remained silent over Harry’s allegations, including that the Prince of Wales left his younger brother terrified after screaming at him during a summit at Sandringham held to discuss his exit from royal life. Harry also claimed in the TV series that Kensington Palace “lied to protect my brother” when it issued a statement denying a story William had bullied him out of the royal family. And he accused his father Charles of lying at a tense crisis meeting with the Queen in January 2020. Harry’s memoir, released in the UK on January 10, became the fastest-selling non-fiction book in the UK since records began in 1998. Meanwhile, sales of Elizabeth Arden’s Eight Hour Cream have surged after Harry revealed in his memoir he used it to treat his “frost-nipped” penis. Boots said that sales of the £29 ointment increased by more than 60 percent compared to last year, while online searches shot up 180 percent.
