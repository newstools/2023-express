The Princess of Wales will come under fire while Prince William is set for a tough time with the publication of Harry's memoir, Spare, a royal expert has claimed. Harry's book is officially on sale from January 10 with sources suggesting the first in line to the throne will be "painted in the harshest light", according to Daniela Elser. Pointing to UK media reports, Ms Elser writes in an op-ed published on news.com.au: "Reporting out of London earlier this week revealed that, according to 'a source with knowledge' of Spare, it is the elder prince who is painted in the harshest light." Ms Elser, quoting a report, adds: "'It’s tough on William, in particular, and even Kate gets a bit of a broadside,' the source said. 'There are these minute details, and a description of the fight between the brothers. I personally can’t see how Harry and William will be able to reconcile after this.'" She continues: "For Kate, right now, watching her formerly close brother-in-law on the cusp of yet another offensive, and with not only her husband reportedly in his sights but her too, must be a particularly hard experience, not least because there is nothing they can do." The royal commentator adds: "The way things look today, there may well be more discomfort and sadness for William and Kate to come."  THIS LIVE BLOG HAS NOW ENDED
