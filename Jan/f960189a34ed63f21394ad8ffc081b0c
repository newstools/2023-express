Ashley Roberts, 41, recently revealed she's on the look-out for a new partner, and has reportedly joined exclusive celebrity dating app Raya in a bid to find someone she truly connects with. The Pussycat Doll-turned-Heart FM radio host is unlikely to have any shortage of offers - especially if this ultra-glamorous New Year's Eve photo set is anything to go by. Ashley demonstrated she hasn't lost her toned and trim dancer's physique when she headed off to a mystery travel hotspot by the beach, clad in just a brown sheer dress. Clearly enjoying a festive break that was about to draw to a close, the star shared a final set of snapshots from her hotel balcony, quipping: "NYE grateful for ya #lastsunset." The floral, patterned off-the-shoulder dress she wore was from Jaded London, and fans can copy her post-Christmas style for the surprisingly slim price of Â£80.
