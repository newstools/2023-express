Manchester United will not rush Jadon Sancho back into Premier League action after the England outcast finally returned to first-team training, according to reports. Sancho had been sent to train alone with specialist coaches in Holland in a bid to improve his confidence, but he is now back in the fold at Old Trafford. The 22-year-old has not featured since United’s 1-1 draw with Chelsea on October 22. Manager Erik ten Hag and his coaching staff provided the player with an individual plan designed to improve his confidence and performances. Sancho has been training alone since the start of the World Cup. That is according to the Daily Mail, who report that United have devised a plan to ease Sancho back into competitive first-team football. Ten Hag has insisted that the winger will not play until he is definitely ready. The move by Ten Hag received some criticism, with some fans and pundits believing that Sancho's low confidence would be further dented by being told to prepare individually. However, United have stuck with the decision and hope to reap the rewards. Sancho has not hit the heights during his spell at United that he achieved at Dortmund. In Germany, Sancho scored a mammoth 50 goals and registered 64 assists in just 137 appearances. But at United, he has bagged just eight times and set up a further four goals. Three of those strikes have come this term, in wins over Liverpool, Leicester and Europa League minnows Sheriff Tiraspol.
