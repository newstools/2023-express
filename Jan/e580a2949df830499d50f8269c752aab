A man accused of inflicting horrific abuse on his Bumble date has been released from prison after posting $50,000 bond. Zachary Kent Mills was arrested last week and charged with first-degree aggravated kidnapping. The 21-year-old Texan man was arrested by Harris County deputies after officers received reports that a woman was assaulted by a man she met online, later identified as Mills. The Harris County Constable’s Office Precinct 4 responded to a call in Tomball, Texas, on December 29 about the incident. Police investigated the incident and determined the victim was at Mill’s residence five days earlier, who allegedly held her against her will. The victim also claimed that Mill's sexually assaulted her multiple times before she was able to get free and seek help from a neighbour. The victim claimed when she arrived at his apartment, Mills attempted to have sex with her, and as soon as she denied the advances, he began to assault her with a closed fist, would not let her leave, and bit her on the neck and face, according to court documents. Mills also allegedly hit her with the handle of a screwdriver when he became tired of using his hands. She also told officers she was denied food and water while inside his residence. Following the assault, the woman said she suffered from "serious bodily injury".
