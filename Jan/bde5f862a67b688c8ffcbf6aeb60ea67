As 2023 dawns, so does Marvel Phase 5. MCU fans will know that Iron Man to Avengers Endgame was known as the Infinity Saga (Marvel Phases 1-3) and we’re now currently enjoying the Multiverse Saga (Marvel Phases 4-6). Kicking off Phase 5 is Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantumania aka Ant-Man 3, which properly introduces Marvel fans to Jonathan Majors’ Kang the Conqueror, the MCU’s new big villain following on from Josh Brolin’s Thanos. His variant He Who Remains previously turned up in Loki but this is the main guy himself, a time travelling despot from a thousand years in the future who Scott Lang and co will take on deep down in the Quantum Realm. The new trailer arrives tonight, as announced by Marvel Studios with teaser footage and a poster you can view below. In the new footage, Kang tells Ant-Man, “This place isn’t what you think. You’re out of your league, Ant-Man.” Sharing a new image, Marvel Studios said: “Check out the new poster and don’t miss the new trailer for Marvel Studios’ Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania tonight in the College Football Playoff National Championship at 7:30 PM ET only on @espn.” That’s 12:30am GMT for UK fans, but according to insider Daniel Richtman, the trailer will debut live on TV after the third quarter. With this in mind, it’s likely the new footage will drop at some point between 9:30pm-10:15 ET, which is 2:30-3:15am GMT for those staying up on this side of the pond. But don't worry if you can't watch it as no doubt it’ll hit the internet around the same time. Now what’s particularly interesting about the new poster is its tagline, which says: “Witness the beginning of a new dynasty.” READ MORE: Avengers Secret Wars leak – Tobey Maguire Spider-Man return and more A dynasty is a line of hereditary rulers and Avengers 5, set for release in 2025, is called Avengers: The Kang Dynasty. The blockbuster takes its name from the Marvel Comics run of the same name when Kang conquered Earth with his son Marcus aka Scarlet Centurion. Presumably, the Ant-Man 3 tagline is setting up the beginning of the villain's rise in the MCU at the start of Marvel Phase 5. Whatever the case, no doubt the trailer will spill more. Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantumania hits cinemas on February 17, 2023.
