Samsung might be about to announce the launch of its flagship Galaxy S23 but if splashing out over £700 on a new top-end smartphone sounds a bit rich then Motorola is hoping it has the answer. The famous phone firm has just unveiled five new devices which all offer big specs such as speedy 120Hz screens, dual-lens cameras and stereo speakers with most costing under £200. That's very cheap but those on a really tight budget will be pleased to hear that one of these new call makers will arrive in UK stores soon for under £100. Yes, the Moto e13 can be popped into your pocket for just £89 and don't think that low price means bargain basement features. This budget blower comes packed with upgrades including a 6.5-inch HD+ screen, a massive 5000mAh battery and a clever AI-powered camera that tweaks your pictures so you always get the perfect shot. There's even Dolby Atmos audio to make those boxset binges sound a little more immersive. Motorola has confirmed that the e13 will be available in three colours: cosmic black, aurora green and creamy white and is arriving from early March with a starting MSRP of £89.99 on Amazon, Argos, Carphone Warehouse, Currys, John Lewis, 02, Tesco and Vodafone. So that's the cut-priced phone but what about the rest?

As the name suggests there's also full access to 5G data speeds which can whizz files and films to the phone at speeds of over 300Mbps. Next up there's the moto g53 5G which also features a 50-megapixel camera with Quad Pixel technology and a dedicated Macro Vision lens for extreme closeups. This device is powered by Qualcomm's speedy Snapdragon 480+ processor and packs a 5000mAh battery under its shell. The final two devices include the moto g23 and g13 which include slightly slower 90Hz 6.5-inch screens and ditch 5G for 4G. However, the g23 does come with TurboPower 30W charging, giving hours of power in just minutes. All of these phones will go on sale in March with full details on price below.
