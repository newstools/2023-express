Shirley Patrick, 83, a retired nurse, died in hospital 17 days after suffering life-threatening injuries. She sustained "traumatic lacerations" and "significant injuries" to her head, body, face and arms as a result of the mauling. An inquest was opened today and was adjourned by Gwent Coroner Caroline Saunders. Her provisional cause of death was listed as "sepsis caused by pneumonia and infected scalp wounds". The attack took place in Caerphilly, South Wales, on December 3. It took place only a mile and a half away from a house where 10-year-old schoolboy Jack Lis was also killed by a dog in November 2021. Shirley's son, Paul, 55, was also taken to the hospital with minor injuries following the incident but has since been released. Four people were arrested on suspicion of being in charge of a dog dangerously out of control and causing injury. All have been released under conditional bail. The dog, a large black XL bully cross cane corso breed, was seized by officers and has been destroyed. Police say their investigation continues and officers will be making further enquiries in the local area. Detective Chief Inspector Matthew Sedgebeer said: "If you have concerns or any information regarding this dog and its previous behaviour then please do stop and talk with us." Neighbours questioned by the police indicated that "all hell broke loose" inside the house before police and paramedics were called in December. Shirley's grandson previously owned and ran a dog-walking business named Leeondogs but moved out of the family home shortly before the tragedy took place. She was widowed three years ago when her husband Dennis died. Another neighbour said: "She's just a nice old lady who you see walking around. "Poor thing to suffer like that at her age."
