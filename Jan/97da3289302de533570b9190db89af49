Rochelle Humes, 33, shared a sweet photo on her Instagram today as her nine-year-old daughter, Alaia-Mai, met Kate Middleton. The Princess of Wales held on to delighted Alaia-Mai's shoulders and smiled down at her for the sweet snap.

The Hit List host gushed over how he was “proud of my girls”. Rochelle, Alaia-Mai, and Kate were also joined by beaming BBC journalist Kate Silverton, who looked lovely in a black maxi skirt and blazer.
