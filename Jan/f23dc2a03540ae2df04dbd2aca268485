Beyoncé, 41, put on a show-stopping display as she took to the red carpet at the opening of the new luxury hotel Atlantis The Royal in Dubai. The gold gown highlighted her bust with gleaming sequined cups and a triangular cut-out over her midriff. The dress had a thin flap at the front of the skirt running down the front, making sure she covered her modesty. She however put on a very leggy display in the revealing number, with the dress also featuring a large metallic train that dragged behind her and also draped over her arms. This comes as Beyoncé returned to the stage to perform for the first time in four years, with the moment being captured on Twitter despite there being a phone ban at the event.
