Former Yardbirds star and Rod Stewart collaborator Jeff Beck died on Tuesday after contracting bacterial meningitis at the age of 78. The music world has been pouring out tributes to the incredibly influential guitarist over the last 24 hours. And included among them were Queen legends Brian May and Roger Taylor, who have both performed with Beck over the decades. Sharing pictures with Beck, Brian May wrote on his Instagram: “Gutted, so sad, to hear of Jeff’s passing. He was the Guv’nor. He was inimitable, irreplaceable - the absolute pinnacle of guitar playing. And a damn fine human being. I’m sure I will have a lot to say, but right now …. Just lost for words. Bri. #jeffbeck." Back in 1989, on the Queen for an Hour interview for BBC Radio 1, May listed the late star along with Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton as his all-time greatest guitar heroes.
