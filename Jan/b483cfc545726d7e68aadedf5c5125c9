Prince Harry’s highly-anticipated memoir Spare will hit the shelves next week, with the publisher Penguin Random House promising the book to be full of “raw unflinching honesty” from the Duke of Sussex’s journey from “trauma to healing”. But will you be reading? Vote in our poll.  The 416-page book, which will be translated into 15 other languages is set to make a series of allegations against the Royal Family as readers are taken back to Princess Diana’s funeral in 1997, sharing Harry’s perspective from this landmark event up to his decision to step back from the Firm in 2020.

I've worn many hats over the years, both literally and figuratively, and my hope is that in telling my story – the highs and lows, the mistakes, the lessons learned – I can help show that no matter where we come from, we have more in common than we think.” He continued: “I'm deeply grateful for the opportunity to share what I've learned over the course of my life so far and excited for people to read a first-hand account of my life that's accurate and wholly truthful.” An audiobook version of Spare, read by Harry himself, will also be released on the same day. To coincide with the publication, two new interviews with Harry are set to air on Sunday. Harry sits down with ITV’s News at Ten presenter Tom Bradby and Anderson Cooper on CBS’ 60 Minutes.
