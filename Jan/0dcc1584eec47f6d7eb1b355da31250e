High flu and Covid rates mean hospital bed occupancy remains far too high and emergency departments are congested. That is why on Monday, at Parliament’s first sitting day of the New Year, I announced a £250million package to help ease the winter pressure on our NHS. The proposals include up to £200 million investment to help speed up the discharge of around 2,500 hospital patients. Some of the money will go towards block booking beds in care homes to free up space on hospital wards. We will also invest a further £50 million in new “modular” units in hospital grounds that can be erected quickly to provide extra space for patients who need extra care after being treated in accident and emergency departments but who do not need to stay on wards.  Last week, I visited Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust’s Care Coordination Centre and saw how staff use real-time information on bed occupancy can be used to maximise efficiency. It shows that we can use innovation and technology to make our NHS more efficient, ease the pressure on services and deliver the care that patients need.
