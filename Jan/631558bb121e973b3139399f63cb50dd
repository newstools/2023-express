His speciality was bringing mayhem to the page, particularly with the antics of young reprobate Dennis the Menace and his pet dog Gnasher. The veteran artist, who was described as the “single most important illustrator” in the Beano’s history by the comic’s current editor John Anderson, continued working until shortly before his death. Sutherland joined Dundee-based publishers DC Thomson in 1959, one year after the Beano’s circulation figures had swelled to two million. He drew episodes of The Bash Street Kids featuring a mainstay of nine rebellious and unruly Class 2B cohorts who made their teachers’ lives a misery. His deft skills elevated the comic strip to a double-page spread and he soon began sketching Biffo the Bear and Minnie the Minx. Sutherland drew an estimated 4,000 strips during his lifetime, including 1,000 episodes of Dennis the Menace between 1970 and 1998. He was born in Invergordon in the Scottish Highlands, the youngest of three children. His mother died when he was two and his father moved the children first to Stirling to be closer to family, and then to Kirkintilloch, north of Glasgow. He loved doodling and painting from a young age and, following his schooling, joined Rex Studios to study design and illustration. He came to DC Thomson’s attention with his impressive designs in one of its drawing competitions. Sutherland’s talent was recognised in the most recent New Year’s Honours List with an OBE. He is survived by his wife Margaret and their two daughters.
