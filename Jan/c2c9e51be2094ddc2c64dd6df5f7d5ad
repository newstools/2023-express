Jamie Lee Curtis, 64, put on a very busty display at the 34th Annual Palm Springs International Film Awards on Thursday evening. The Halloween star showcased her famous assets in a plunging black blazer worn over a black bra. She also amped up the glamour wearing sheer, sequinned trousers paired with black court heels. Jamie arrived at the Hollywood event with fellow actress Cate Blanchett, who also looked sensational in a plunging black jumpsuit. Jamie presented Cate with the Desert Palm Achievement Award for her performance in Tár. While on stage, Cate joked that they almost missed the bash when Jamie came out wearing just her "bra and knickers". The Lord of the Rings actress laughed during her speech: "We had this lengthy conversation about whether I should get into pyjamas before driving back tonight. "Meanwhile, she’s telling me this about what I should wear, and she comes out in her bra and knickers. This is why we nearly missed the tonight’s event!”
