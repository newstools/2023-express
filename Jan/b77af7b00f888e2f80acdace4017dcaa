There's just a matter of hours left in the transfer window now with many clubs up and down the Premier League still looking to do business. Around Â£450million has already been spent throughout the January window from Premier League clubs and that doesn't look like stopping any time soon. Everton, who are yet to make any new signings in January, are expected to be busy in the final few days of the market. Sean Dyche is set to be unveiled as the new Everton manager following Frank Lampard's dismissal and Anthony Gordon's exit to Newcastle should free up some funds for the club to make some late moves. Newcastle are also set to make a late flurry in the market with a young right-back and an attacker still on Eddie Howe's wishlist. But the biggest storyline heading into deadline day will be following Moises Caicedo's future at Brighton. The midfielder has been banished from the club following a statement put out on his social media page, urging the club to let him leave after both Arsenal and Chelsea had bids rejected. Express Sport is on hand to provide all the latest breaking news throughout the day.
