Aside from being a rock star in Queen and animal rights campaigner, Sir Brian May also has a doctorate in astrophysics. The guitarist was good friends with Sir Patrick Moore, the astronomer who famously presented BBC’s The Sky at Night from 1957. He was also a leading lunar expert consulted by NASA on the surface of the moon before the Apollo landings. The TV legend may have spent much of his professional life in front of a camera, but footage of him at home with his friends barely exists – until now. Patrick Moore in the Sun is the first documentary on the late astronomer and will take audiences inside his Selsey house on the day of the transit of Venus on June 8, 2004. There the monocle-wearing national treasure was joined by Sir Brian and Chris Lintott to witness the historic astronomical event together. According to a statement: “The documentary reveals Sir Patrick's great kindness, wit and wisdom in intimate surroundings, with professional and amateur astronomy friends freely relating their sincere love and appreciation of the great man – who inspired their interest in astronomy and whom they could count on as a true friend.” READ MORE: Freddie Mercury – Bohemian Rhapsody's music video was a happy accident European AstroFest conference attendees will be the first to witness exclusive footage from the new documentary that is currently in production, marking the 10th anniversary since Sir Patrick's death and his 100th birthday on March 5.
