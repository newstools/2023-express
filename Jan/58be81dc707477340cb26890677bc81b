Harry Kane is open to a shock contract extension at Tottenham that would take him beyond the summer of 2024, according to reports. The England striker has 18 months remaining on his deal and it had been widely expected that he would explore his options come the end of his terms. No talks over a new contract have taken place since August 2021, when Kane was set on a blockbuster £100million transfer to Manchester City. The absence of a club trophy in his career had prompted the 29-year-old to seek a move to Pep Guardiola’s side. That is according to The Athletic, who report that Kane could prolong his career with Spurs. It comes amid reports that a Manchester United hierarchy looking for Erik ten Hag's No 9 would be keen on signing the Three Lions captain. Sky Italia reports that Spurs have offered Conte a new contract but he has told the club's hierarchy that he does not want to think about his future just yet. The report continues that Conte might ask Spurs to terminate his deal so he can return to Italy to be closer to his family. Spurs will not activate the extension clause on a manager who does not want to be at the club. Their form under Conte this season - which has them six points off fourth - would add credence to the growing argument that the 53-year-old is not indispensable, either. The club will instead prioritise the contract of star striker Kane. it remains to be seen if he signs a fresh deal, or decides that his future lies elsewhere.
