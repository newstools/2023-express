Germany is delaying a decision to send Leopard 2 battle tanks to Ukraine amid fears it could lead to war between Russia and Nato. US Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin defended Germany, insisting “they will continue to be a reliable ally going forward”. Kyiv wants 300 armoured fighting machines to pummel Russia out of Ukrainian territory. President Volodymyr Zelensky, in a video message to allies, thanked the West, but urged leaders to “speed up” military assistance. He added: “I can thank you hundreds of times but hundreds of thank-yous are not hundreds of tanks.” There are more than 2,000 Leopard tanks in millitary warehouses all over Europe. At the summit in his country, Boris Pistorius, inset, the German defence minister, said a decision on its Leopards could be “made in a week, in a month, or in a day”. He said: “The impression that sometimes arises that Germany is standing in the way is wrong. There are many allies who say: ‘We share the view you’ve set out here’. There are good reasons for delivering [the Leopards] and good reasons against it.” But Germany pledged to get its tanks ready so it could “act quickly” if needed. Mr Austin praised Britain’s leadership for committing to send 14 Challenger 2 tanks to Ukraine. He said Moscow “is regrouping, recruiting, ­trying to re-equip”. Sweden will give CV90 fighting vehicles and howitzers, Latvia will give Stinger missiles and helicopters, while Denmark and Estonia will provide howitzers. Western officials believe there is a “window of opportunity” for Ukraine to counter-attack as Russia ­struggles to resupply. But the Kremlin played down the West’s military assistance. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: “One should not exaggerate the importance of such supplies in terms of changing something.”
