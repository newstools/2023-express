Manchester United have already added the signature of Jack Butland in the January transfer window but that is not expected to be the last of Erik ten Hag's business. A new striker is now the Dutchman's top priority as he searches for a replacement for Cristiano Ronaldo. Wout Weghorst appears to have become the Dutchman's top target with the club reportedly in talks with Besiktas and Burnley over ending his loan deal in the Turkish Super Lig to allow him to come to Old Trafford. The 30-year-old has already appeared to wave goodbye to the club and its supporters with his heart set on a return to the Premier League. Joao Felix, Vincent Aboubakar and Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting have also been among the names linked but Ten Hag looks to have settled on his man. In the meantime, Anthony Martial shall remain as the club's sole out and out No 9.
