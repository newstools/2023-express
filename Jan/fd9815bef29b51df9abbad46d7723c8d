The Scottish Parliament has been suspended after an anti-Sturgeon protest caused chaos at Holyrood. MPs had returned to the chamber today for the first time since the festive break. Presiding officer Alison Johnstone announced there would be a "brief suspension" after protesters disrupted the session during First Minister's Questions.  Shouting could be heard from the public gallery, with protesters directing concerns at the First Minister. Ms Sturgeon was facing scrutiny over her handling of the NHS crisis, with Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross using the session to raise criticism of "patient-blaming" language over problems in the NHS This is the second protest to hit Ms Sturgeon in a matter of days. Yesterday, teachers demonstrated outside the First Minister's official residence demanding higher wage, as thousands walked out of classrooms across Scotland. Andrene Bamford, the president of the Scottish teachers' union, told the crowd the rate of inflation was "still crazy", adding: "If we don’t get a decent pay settlement our wages will be further eroded.”   The aim of the legislation is to make it easier for trans people to change their legal gender and get a gender recognition certificate (GRC), which is seen as an integral part of trans inclusion. But critics say the law undermines sexual equality and poses a risk to women’s safety. The protest saw more than 1,000 people demonstrate in front of Holyrood to show their opposition to the legislation. Many of them held placards reading: "Save our single sex spaces" or "Woman is not a costume".
