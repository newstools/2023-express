Making their own decisions came top of the list of perks, while feeling free, and going to bed when they want, also featured. Others like not having to put up with annoying habits such as snoring and moaning from fellow travellers, and having no risk of drama or fallings out. And 39 percent feel holidaying solo allowed them to step outside of their comfort zone, while 34 percent claimed they learnt a lot about themselves. It also emerged the top reasons for going it alone were simply for a break (33 percent), and to treat themselves (30 percent). And 17 percent booked a holiday to reconnect with themselves after a break-up. Gary Anslow, head of UK and Ireland business at Norwegian Cruise Line, which commissioned the study, said: “We can see from the survey that enjoying the beauty of travel on your own enables a truly authentic experience, and provides for self-discovery and growth. “Plus, meeting fellow solo travellers can even lead to long-lasting friendships.” The study, carried out via OnePoll, also found that, of the 34 percent who are yet to travel alone, almost a fifth (18 percent) would like to. A cruise (19 percent), a relaxing getaway (28 percent), and a city break (27 percent) score high on their wish lists. Reasons for wanting to experience a solo trip included to treat themselves (43 percent), have a break from reality (38 percent), and to prove to themself and others they can do it (26 percent). Looking ahead, 31 percent who have travelled solo before have booked another trip alone for 2023. It also emerged that, on average, independent jet-setters have been on four trips alone – with popular destinations including France (16 percent), Spain (14 percent), and Italy (13 percent). Outside of Europe they have visited North America (10 percent), Australia (10 percent), and Africa (nine percent). But many still enjoy being sociable with other holidaymakers, with 29 percent claiming they’re still good friends with fellow travellers they met on vacation.
