Manchester United are focusing on extending contracts and preparing for the summer transfer window in the final week of January. Marcus Rashford is just one of a few United players whose futures at Old Trafford are up in the air ahead of entering the final 12 months of their contracts. The 25-year-old has struck the strongest patch of form of his career under Erik ten Hag this season, scoring nine goals in as many games since the World Cup. So concern is growing over whether he will extend terms at United with Paris Saint-Germain among clubs sniffing around him. Ten Hag has also made an honest admission about another of his forwards, Antony, after a polarising start to life at the Red Devils. The Brazilian winger has underwhelmed many after his Â£88million arrival, and his manager has addressed the criticism. As United prepare for the summer transfer window, Harry Kane has returned to the forefront of links as Ten Hag targets a new striker as a priority. And the Tottenham Hotspur superstar has provided a fresh hint on where his future lies amid the club's tumultuous season. Follow LIVE updates below...
