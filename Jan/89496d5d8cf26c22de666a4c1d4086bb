Manchester United have already welcomed two new signings to their ranks so far this month, and their work in the transfer window is far from over. Erik ten Hag is keen to strengthen his squad further ahead of the second half of the season, as well as plotting moves for when the summer window arrives. The Red Devils face Arsenal today at the Emirates Stadium in what will be one of their trickiest encounters of the campaign, with a victory for either side expected to play a significant role in the title race. New arrival Wout Weghorst struggled on his debut against Crystal Palace earlier this week so it remains to be seen whether he did enough to retain his spot in the starting eleven. The Dutchman joined United on loan from Burnley to fill the hole left by Cristiano Ronaldo earlier this season, with the forward terminating his loan at Besiktas in order to return to the Premier League. Jack Butland was also signed from Palace after Newcastle recalled on-loan goalkeeper Martin Dubravka. Ten Hag will be hoping that the aforementioned duo are not his only two signings this month, though today’s match will be a strong indicator of how much quality his squad could lack.
