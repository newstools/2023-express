Day seven of the Australian Open is well underway with Karen Khachanov, Coco Gauff and Iga Swiatek among those in action overnight. There is plenty more to come, too, with Stefanos Tsitsipas and Jannik Sinner preparing to contest a thrilling fourth-round clash in Melbourne. With the finals edging closer, the women's draw has been blown wide open over the past few hours with top seed Swiatek crashing out. The dominant Pole was beaten in straight sets by Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina, while seventh seed Coco Gauff also fell to Jelena Ostapenko. Many of the men's draw heavyweights have already been knocked out and Novak Djokovic is taking time to recover following his third-round win over Grigor Dimitrov on Saturday. In his absence, Tsitsipas and Sinner will take to the court in a bid to make it to the quarter-finals.
