He told host Dan Wootton: "We wouldn't want any harm come to Harry and Meghan, but if they stayed quiet and lived a dignified life, and did the work they were supposed to do.... "I know the Americans love the Royal Family, so why would Harry want to destroy and dismantle the very institution which he came from, which his mother loved? "Why would he want to do that? So Harry, stay quiet! It's time for them to stay quiet."  When countering a fellow panellist who questioned whether the monarchy was as great as people believe, Mr Burrell became increasingly animated. He exclaimed: "I know the situation!

"She had him for 11 years, and what Harry's doing now he's seeing the world through an 11-year-old's eyes. "His late grandmother would be turning in her grave if she heard what he was saying about the institution of the monarchy, which she devoted her 70 years life service to."
