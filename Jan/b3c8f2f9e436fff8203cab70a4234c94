Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta says Thomas Partey will have an MRI scan on a rib injury this weekend. The midfielder was forced off with the issue at half-time of the FA Cup fourth-round loss to Manchester City. Partey started the match at the Etihad but appeared to suffer the problem early on. He did not come out for the second half and was replaced by Albert Sambi Lokonga. In his post-match press conference, Arteta said he didn't want to take any unnecessary risks over Partey. He said: "He felt something and we didn't want to take any risks so he couldn't continue." However, the Spaniard then confirmed Partey will have a MRI scan to discover the extent of the issue. Arteta and Arsenal fans will be sweating over the results of the scan. Partey has been hugely influential in the Gunners' form this season.

Nathan Ake scored the only goal of the game 20 minutes into the second half. After a Julian Alvarez shot came back off the post, Jack Grealish remained composed before setting up Ake to calmly place past Arsenal's No 2 goalkeeper Matt Turner. Arteta told ITV: "We are disappointed. "I think we could have got much more from the game but an action decided the game. It was a really tight match, really competitive game and an action decided the game and unfortunately we're out.

He added: "In the second half when we had a lot of control in the game and we had big situations there that we didn't put away. "In those games, you need to do that. We can take a lot of positives.
