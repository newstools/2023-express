One in five has vowed to quit in the next year or two or “as soon as possible”. Ministers were warned of a “mental health crisis” among “disillusioned” ­officers furious over low pay.  It means the ability to “protect the ­public effectively rests on a knife edge”, the Police Federation warned. They added: “We will not be able to keep our communities safe from violent crime.” “Record numbers” were leaving the service already, they said, with 3,433 voluntarily quitting in the year to March. In 2012, the number of voluntary resignations from the police stood at 1,158. More than 1,800 police officers hired as part of Boris Johnson’s pledge to boost numbers by 20,000 have already gone. Ministers will be alarmed by a Police Federation survey which shows that more than 25,000 officers would not recommend other people to join.  Crimes in England and Wales are at an all-time high, with a big increase in violent and sexual offences. Some 6.5 million crimes were recorded in the 12 months to June. The Police Federation warned “the ­number of officers who feel unfairly paid given the dangers and demands of the job has also hit a record high”. And Martin Hewitt, the National Police Chiefs’ Council chair, said: “In real-terms, officers’ pay lags behind 2010. “It is essential pay awards are fully funded and not only keep pace with ­inflation but allow earnings to catch up.” A Home Office spokesman said: “We are injecting record funds into policing.”
