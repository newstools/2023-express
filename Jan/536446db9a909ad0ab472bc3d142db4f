Members of the public have been warned to avoid a clifftop at a popular seaside town after it gave way overnight amid heavy winds. Dramatic photographs show the damage caused after the cliff collapsed in Newquay, Cornwall. Part of a metal barrier at the top of the ridge has plummeted down the cliff and onto a beach. Debris is pictured strewn across the sand in the west of the town, which is popular with tourists. Newquay Town Council tweeted: "A section of the cliff on the Killacourt has fallen. "This area has been fenced off and clearly marked with signage. We respectfully ask that everyone adheres to these rules and the barrier is not crossed." But residents shared their ire on Facebook today. Many pointed out that the land on top of the cliff has often been ringfenced for development, and stressed this is dangerous. One woman wrote: "And yet building on top of the cliff continues. What does it take to realise the cliff top can’t take much more?" Another resident stated: "Not the first time there's been a cliff collapse there." A third shared: "Another reason why development isn’t suitable or safe." It is thought no one has been injured as a result of the fall. Cornwall has been lashed with heavy rain in the past 24 hours and wind gusts have reached 47mph overnight in the county. Although flood defences have been rolled out in most regions today, there are as of yet no warnings for floods in Cornwall. Devon and Cornwall Police said the force hasn't been called to any reports of a cliff fall. Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service has been contacted for further information.
