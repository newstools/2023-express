Day six of the Australian Open is well underway with Alex de Minaur, Holger Rune, Dan Evans and Andrey Rublev among those in action overnight, while Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic each prepare to take to the courts this morning. The third round is beginning to take shape as action intensifies Down Under, with the men's final just over a week away. All eyes will be pointed towards Murray on Saturday as he takes on 24th seed Roberto Bautista Agut for a place in the fourth round. The Scot already has two five-set battles under his belt after dispatching Matteo Berrettini and Thanasi Kokkinakis. The match with the latter raged on until the early hours of Thursday morning, eventually becoming the longest of Murray's career and the latest finish at 4am local time. By comparison, Djokovic should be less fatigued as he prepares to take on 27th seed Grigor Dimitrov. The women's draw also has plenty for fans to sink their teeth into with Caroline Garcia and Ekaterina Alexandrova among those preparing for action.
