Tory MP Caroline Nokes and former Tory MP Baroness Nicky Morgan yesterday helped hand a petition to No 10, signed by more than 64,000 people, calling for better protection. Charities Glitch and the End Violence Against Women coalition (EVAW) also held placards demanding tough guidance. Ms Nokes, MP for Romsey and Southampton North, said: "I always reflect that what happens in the online space all too often overflows into real life. "It's crucially important that we change the culture of misogyny and the culture of abuse." The petition calls for the Bill to introduce a violence against women and girls (VAWG) code of practice. This would provide clear rules for tech companies on how to prevent and respond to violence and hold them to account for not prioritising female safety - or face serious consequences. Women are 27 times more likely than men to be harassed online, Glitch and EVAW said - while one in five women suffers online harassment or abuse. Andrea Simon, director of EVAW, said: "If they aren't forced to, platforms won't fix a system they're profiting from."
