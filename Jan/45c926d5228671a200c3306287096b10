Police are searching for a leopard after it escaped from its zoo enclosure in a situation officals describe as "serious". Dallas Zoo in the US is closed as workers and police officers hunt for the rare clouded leopard, named Nova. Aerial footage shows police armed with machine guns in a huddle as they plot the feline's capture.  It is unclear where the leopard is, though officials believe the animal is still hiding on the grounds. They have reassured the public that Nova is around the size of a cat and harmless to humans. In social media posts on Friday, the zoo wrote: "The Zoo is closed today due to a serious situation." A follow up post added: "We have an ongoing situation at the Zoo right now with a Code Blue â€“ that is a non-dangerous animal that is out of its habitat. "One of our clouded leopards was not in its habitat when the team arrived this morning and is unaccounted for at this time.   "Dallas PD is onsite assisting with the search efforts. The Zoo is closed today as our teams work to find and recover the animal. "Given the nature of these animals, we believe the animal is still on grounds and hiding. We will share updates and more information as soon as we can." Mr Edell, vice president for animal care at the Dallas Zoo, said the clouded leopard weighs between "20 and 25lbs" and "does not pose a danger to humans". He said that "more likely than not, when she's scared, she is likely to climb a tree, stay out of our way" and "hunt some squirrels".

Nova is believed to have escaped from a tear in the mesh enclosure she shares with her sister Luna. Both leopards, aged between three and four, were brought to Dallas Zoo in 2021 after being raised in Houston Zoo.
