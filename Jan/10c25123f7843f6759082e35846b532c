The Australian Open is well underway in Melbourne as the players get through their first round matches as Andy Murray takes on Matteo Berrettini at the Rod Laver Arena. The former world No 1, back on the road to recovery after years of trouble with a hip injury, looks to be finally back to his best as he faces last year's semi-finalist. The 35-year-old got off to a thunderous start as temperatures soared in Melbourne, with the three-time Grand Slam winner taking the first two sets against Wimbledon 2021 finalist Berrettini. However, the powerful Italian got back on level terms to take the match to a final set after edging the fourth set, with the match finely poised at 6-3, 6-3, 4-6, 6-7 before they contested the final set. Novak Djokovic, seeded fourth for the tournament, will get underway against Roberto Carballes Baena later on in the day with plenty more action to bring you from the opening rounds of the first Major of 2023.
