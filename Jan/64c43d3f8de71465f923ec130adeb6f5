Michelle looked glamorous as she sported a black strapless gown, embellished with a big metallic bow in the middle. The actress wowed in the short ensemble as she put her toned legs on full display. The beauty teamed her attire with a pair of towering, strappy heels as the former Coronation Street star styled her brunette locks straight and also sported a pair of gold hoop earrings. Michelle kept her makeup light as she showed off her tanned skin. Her husband Mark looked equally smart as the former TOWIE star kept it casual in trousers and a long-sleeve top and paired the look with brown loafers. The duo was joined at Nobu by a host of famous faces including Liam Payne, Rochelle and Marvin Humes and Kendall Jenner. Their appearance comes ahead of Beyonce's gig which will be held at Atlantis The Royal over the weekend.
