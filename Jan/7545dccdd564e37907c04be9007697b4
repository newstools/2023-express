KSI put out a huge statement to arch nemesis Jake Paul by knocking out FaZe Temperrr in the first round of their highly-anticipated fight at Wembley's OVO Arena in London on Saturday night. The YouTuber-turned-boxer was initially scheduled to fight UFC icon Dillon Danis, but his original opponent pulled out with 10 days to go. Temperrr, the head of the famous Faze Clan, stepped up to save the fight but was unable to cause KSI any serious problems before he was floored by a huge left hand in the opening round. The Brit came flying out of the blocks to assert his dominance with a ferocious left-handed shot before Temperrr replied by landing a punch of his own, although KSI was quick to respond with a deadly right-left combination that left his rival unable to continue. The undercard fights also provided no shortage of entertainment on the night, with the likes of Elle Brooke, Swarmz and Luis Pineda earning victories of their own. Fan favourite Salt Papi also made light work of Josh Brueckner to extend his impressive winning record, while Slim Albaher managed to hold debutant Tom Zanetti at arm's length to retain his Misfits light-heavyweight title in style.
