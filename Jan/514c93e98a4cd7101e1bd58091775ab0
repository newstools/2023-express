Three years on from their announcement, royal expert Richard Fitzwilliams has spoken exclusively to Express.co.uk about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's strained relationship with the monarchy. Speaking of the monarchy, Mr Fitzwilliams said: "The monarchy has, with the exception of Cromwell’s protectorate, lasted over 1,000 years. [It] is an integral part of Britain’s DNA." He added: "The Sussexes would weaken it if they could. They have harmed it, even in Britain, especially among the young." Despite no longer being a senior royal, Harry is still fifth in the royal line of succession. Harry and Meghan's two children, Archie and Lilibet, are still sixth and seventh in line, as stated on the official monarchy website.
