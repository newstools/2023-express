With the rising cost of heating, warm clothing is essential, and many shoppers are investing in cosy loungewear to wear at home.   Shoppers are loving the lounge dress, with some calling the charcoal shade 'lovely'. Lara M said: ''This is a lovely lounger. Comfortable, warm and looks great. I am definitely getting the blue option!'' ClaireD commented: ''Great for after a bath or shower. Or for those days when you feel you need a hug! This lounge dress is lightweight but super cosy. The side slits stop it feeling like a restrictive tube and the pockets are a nice touch.'' Helen also added: ''Great lounge dress for wearing around the house. Neckline, hood and cuffs make it cosy, it's lightweight and allows freedom of movement.''
