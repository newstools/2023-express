A bomb squad has carried out a controlled explosion at Edinburgh Central Mosque after "suspicious bags" were found inside the place of worship. Upon the discovery, the area was evacuated and the mosque closed until further notice. Reporter from Edinburgh Live, Iona Young, posted a video from outside the mosque, in which a loud explosion could be heard. More emergency services were also filmed heading toward the scene.    Following the evacuation earlier today, the mosque released a statement, which read: "We will be closed today for the next few hours and until further notice. "This is due to a couple of bags that we discovered inside the premises early this morning." It continued: "The police have been notified about the bags and following a review of CCTV, they have advised that we evacuate the building and stop any activities until they have removed the bags. "We do not know at this moment how long the process could take, however, will post another update as soon as the bags have been removed and the police have concluded that it is safe to reopen the building." A Police Scotland spokesperson also added: “Around 9.30am on Tuesday, 3 January, police were called to a report of a suspicious item found within a Mosque on Potterrow, Edinburgh. “A cordon has been put in place as a precaution and the EOD are in attendance.”
