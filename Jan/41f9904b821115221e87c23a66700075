NatWest, one of the UK’s most popular high street banks, is to close 23 more branches in the upcoming months. It comes on top of the 43 banks NatWest already had scheduled to shut this year, including 13 that have already closed this month. The bank said the closures are down to more people banking online. Customers who usually bank in an affected branch can benefit from face to face support at mobile branches at various locations throughout the year. Services provided will include making deposits, paying bills and withdrawing cash. More details about the nearest mobile branch can be found on the NatWest website.

Alternatively, NatWest has worked with other UK banks to open shared Banking Hubs. One of their advisers will be there to give people face-to-face help on a set day each week. People can use the Banking Hubs for basic services also, like making deposits; balance enquiries; paying bills and withdrawing cash. Locations can be found on their website.  A NatWest spokesperson said: “As with many industries, most of our customers are shifting to mobile and online banking, because it’s faster and easier for people to manage their financial lives. “We understand and recognise that digital solutions aren’t right for everyone or every situation, and that when we close branches we have to make sure that no one is left behind. “We take our responsibility seriously to support the people who face challenges in moving online, so we are investing to provide them with support and alternatives that work for them.” NatWest customers can access certain services from any of the Post Office's 11,400 branches. Britons are encouraged to use the Post Office's branch finder tool to locate their nearest. Services available include the following cashing/cheque deposits, check balances and withdrawing money. Some may want to consider setting up phone or online banking. If someone is over the age of 60 and are happy to bank over the phone, NatWest has a dedicated support line open from 8am to 8pm seven days a week to help with any banking queries, which people can call on 0800 051 4176. If they want to switch to banking online or via an app, NatWest also has a step-by-step guide on how to set up online and app banking which they can find on its website.
