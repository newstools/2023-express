Russia's military of defence has announced the production of new nuclear warheads that can be fitted to the torpedoes carried by the Russian navy's 'Belgorod' submarines. The development comes at a moment of heightened tension between Russia and NATO over Ukraine amid fears the conflict could spark a nuclear exchange. Defence expert Nicholas Drummond has questioned whether the Kremlin's latest claims about the Poseidon super torpedoes system can be taken as a "genuine threat" or simply dismissed as "Russian bluster." Mr Drummond argues that Russian attempts to present the country's cutting-edge military achievements could be an attempt by Putin to compensate on the world stage following humiliating setbacks in UkraineHe told Express.co.uk: "What we have here is Putin trying to regain some kind of initiative. With his troops failing to achieve any meaningful gains on the ground in Ukraine, he has to convince people at home that he is still in control and that Russia remains a superpower to be reckoned with. "The inconvenient truth is that Russia’s economy has contracted severely over the last 12 months - it is no longer among the Top 10 ranked by GDP. The myth of Russian military invincibility has been busted by its lacklustre performance in Ukraine, and by the catastrophic casualties it has suffered. "Any western leader who conducted a similarly doomed military operation would have already been removed from power. Putin’s failure will have undoubtedly weakened him politically, although for the moment his grip on power appears to be sufficient to prevent him from being ousted."
