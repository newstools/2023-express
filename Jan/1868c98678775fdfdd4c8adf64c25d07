Chelsea boss Graham Potter has declared he does not get involved in disagreements via the media after Benfica boss Roger Schmidt let rip over the Blues' attempts to sign Enzo Fernandez. The German tactician has taken offence to Chelsea's approach to negotiations after the Blues tried to land the World Cup winner for less than his Â£105million release clause.  Schmidt made his feelings clear during a fiery press conference on Thursday, stating: "There is a club that wants him, they tried to attract him, but they know that they can only have him if they pay the clause. "It's disrespectful to all of us, to Benfica, they're driving the player crazy, they pretend they want to pay the clause and then they want to negotiate." Speaking after the 1-0 Premier League defeat to Manchester City, Potter made it clear he had no interest in public spats - distancing himself from the saga. He said: "I don't get involved in conversations via the media. I have nothing to say. No comment." Win a pair of tickets to the Premier League or Women's Super League match of your choosing!

However, it has now emerged that their opening offer did not surpass the player's release clause, as previously indicated. Instead, the Blues were trying to negotiate a cheaper deal having already agreed terms with Fernandez over a long-term contract. Now Chelsea could be forced back to the drawing board with Jorginho and N'Golo Kante still yet to agree new contracts.
