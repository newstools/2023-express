Colin continued: “It’s not as easy as it could be, it's well worth it though, it’s the best thing we’ve ever done.”Echoing in agreement, Kim added: “I’m really glad that we’ve done it and took that step.“Because we did it before Brexit, we’ve been a lot more lucky than people who have done it after.“I think that’s another reason I’ve got to sit here now and think, ‘this is the right thing’ because everything fell into place.”A New Life in the Sun is available to watch on All4.
