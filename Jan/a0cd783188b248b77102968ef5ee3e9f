2023 is the Year of the Rabbit and the next 13 months are said to be a lucky year for most zodiac signs. Express.co.uk spoke to Marites Allen, a celebrity Feng Shui and astrology expert about the Chinese New Year and what each zodiac sign can expect. Born in: 1936, 1948, 1960, 1972, 1984, 1996, 2008, 2020 Marites said: “You could be among the winners in the year of the Water Rabbit. Being blessed with the so-called Future Prosperity star, this could provide you with the auspicious blessings and good fortune, which can be multiplied up to nine times! “As they say ‘Blessed are you who sow every seed you plant, will grow into bountiful crops for great harvest!’” Born in: 1937, 1949, 1961, 1973, 1985, 1997, 2009, 2021 The expert revealed: “Your luck in money and career continues this year. Professionally, you are always trustworthy and can be relied on. “This year, threats of robbery, losses or possible injuries will be bothering the Ox-born people. Nonetheless, with your innate confidence, strength, and stability, you will always prosper even during difficult times. “Just avoid being stubborn, resentful and temperamental, all of which will result in your downfall and destruction.” Born in: 1938, 1950, 1962, 1974, 1986, 1998, 2010, 2022 Marites revealed: “Tigers may continue the harvest of good fortune; however, threats of being robbed, possible losses or injuries loom in your chart. “If you have earned good karma through your past actions, the universe will help you manifest some profitable gains this year. Prevent any of these negative influences with the anti-robbery plague in the Northeast or bring with you the anti-robbery talisman.” READ MORE: What the Year of the Rabbit has in store for all 12 animal signs Born in: 1938, 1951, 1963, 1975, 1987, 1999, 2011, 2023 “This is your year and there is a lot to gain especially that Rabbit-born people are believed to be the harbinger of calmness, peace and tranquillity,” she explained. “Rabbits are advised to be extra careful not to drive away blessings in the form of money or promotion at work. “The only challenge that Rabbits will be facing this year is the threat to their health and longevity, as they will feel easily drained, and uninspired.” Born in: 1928, 1940, 1952, 1964, 1976, 1988, 2000, 2012 “Brace yourself for possible negativities brought by hostile energies that indicate heartaches and misunderstandings,” the astrologer said. “It needs a lot of your patience, tolerance, and restraint to avoid being carried away by the usual heartaches that will present themselves to you. Be strong and take the high road. Avoid at all costs any disagreements and opt for peace and harmonious environment.” Born in: 1928, 1941, 1953, 1965, 1977, 1989, 2001, 2013 Marites said: “The presence of the hostility star in 2023 will rock the peaceful life of Snake-born people. “Usually, the Snakes just glide through life and somehow manage to get through the challenges that come their way. “This time, there are indications of heartaches, misunderstandings, lawsuits, and plenty of quarrelling. Wear some fire element energies, such as red, pink, or purple or other peaceful charms may include the friendship medallion or peace and harmony symbols.” DON'T MISS...M&S shoppers rush to buy new 60p item and ‘everyone will want one’ [NEWS]Wildlife expert top methods to stop squirrels visiting your garden [EXCLUSIVE]Six tried and tested methods to stop onions making you cry [VIDEO] Born in: 1942, 1954, 1966, 1978, 1990, 2002, 2014 “Wealth luck and good fortune will roll in easily towards Horse-born people this 2023!” She added: “This is not the time to take it easy but rather push yourself to the limit and keep on working smart to achieve unlimited funds, profitable partnerships or promotions. “All these will truly bring you extra income. Your investments could also grow and multiply. If you do not need the funds now, no need to sell; rather it would be best to invest even more in assets such as land, gold, silver, or anything that is within your budget. Try to engage in some side hustle for additional income.” Born in: 1931, 1943, 1955, 1967, 1979, 1991, 2003, 2015 “Sheep-born people are quite blessed this 2023!” Marites remarked. "Not only because they are the allies and closest to the year’s ruling animal, the Rabbit, but also because their auspicious Victory star provides them with new beginnings and superior blessings. “This time around, you may receive requests for collaborations in business, partnerships both in new technology, training certifications, coaching services, and the like. “You could gain new heights and experience many new things that are not familiar to you. This is also a good time to venture into unfamiliar territory for expansion.” READ MORE: Astrology expert shares 5 star signs that will be luckiest this year Born in: 1932, 1944, 1956, 1968, 1980, 1992, 2004, 2016 The expert said: “Finally, after what seemed to be a never-ending struggle for the Monkey-born people last year, the Year of the Rabbit 2023, will be quite a period of relief. “Monkeys will be blessed with the very auspicious Victory star. This will surely provide you with a more favourable year. “However, you will still have to manage the threat of three killings starting this year. This is such a bad star that could bring some issues about your name being compromised, loss of money, and some health scare. “Monkey-born are advised to bring the mandala shawl designed with special affirmations and symbol protections.” Born in: 1933, 1945, 1957, 1969, 1981, 1993, 2005, 2017 “Roosters could experience both highs and lows despite of this being your conflict year,” Marites commented. “So take it easy, lie low and best to take a shift, make some necessary changes, or if you can afford it, try to move to a different home, or location or keep travelling. “This is usually the best thing to do when it's your conflict year. You must always bring with you the Tai sui coin or annual protection medallion as your special talisman and display the Tai sui plague in the West sector of your home or office. “This can still be a very busy year for you with possible cash blessings, which will arrive in the form of a windfall.” Born in: 1934, 1946, 1958, 1970, 1982, 1994, 2006, 2018 “Although your animal sign is the secret friend of the Rabbit, it is a must for Dog-born people to provide extra attention on caring for themselves in 2023,” the astrologer revealed. “This is due to the threat of the misfortune star present in your chart at this time. This can seriously bring havoc to your life. “There is also the risk of illness, which may affect your income opportunities and working schedules. Always bring your five element pagoda charm or ultimate mantra amulets. “For extra protection, carry some amulets for health longevity. The Anti-illness Charms will also help neutralise these afflictions.” Born in: 1935, 1947, 1959, 1971, 1983, 1995, 2007, 2019 “Boars are friends with the Rabbit, and that’s good news, indeed,” Marites said. “Therefore despite some hurdles, you may expect some help from the energies of the year. Install the images of your allies and friends in the Northwest sector of your home or office with the images of Rabbit, Sheep or Boar. “Boar people should look after their health as problems with the stomach, itchiness of the skin, or similar infections may pose some risks. This will be irritating and annoying, and if not addressed early, could let you end up in hospital. “Wearing metal element colours and accessories such as white, gold and silver will prove beneficial.” Marites Allen will be launching her new book Decode The Zodiac to Live Your Best Life on January 19 with Greenfinch Publishing.
