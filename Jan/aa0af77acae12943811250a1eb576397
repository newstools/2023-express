Madonna rocked flame-coloured hair and a bright red tartan dress, which she hoisted up to her thighs as she and her family danced the night away on their African holiday. Admiring viewers pointed out that her kids all had "mad talent" as they observed biological son Rocco, 22, backflipping and adopted son David Banda, 17, breakdancing. Also present, as the Material Girl hitmaker continued her fun-packed New Year celebrations, were children Mercy, 16, and twins Stella and Estere, 10, who could all be seen with her at a campsite with a roaring fire blazing behind them. The family are currently in Kenya, where they have enjoyed an elephant safari, as well as "dancing under the full moon with the Masai and good music". Madonna didn't divulge what music had been playing at their camp's party, but instead dubbed over the sound with a recording of her own track, Back That Up To The Beat, as she shared her latest antics with 18.6 million followers.
