Ana Walshe, 39, has been missing from Cohasset since on or about New Year’s Day. Norfolk District Attorney Michael W. Morrissey has since announced her husband Brian Walshe, 47, has been charged with her murder. He said: "Detectives from the Cohasset police department and the Massachusetts police department assigned to the Norfolk District Attorney's office have been involved in an intensive investigation into the fate of Ana Walshe, a 39-year-old Cohasset mother of three since she was first reported missing on January 4. "Early in this investigation, the police developed probable cause to believe her husband Brian Walshe ages 47 had misled police investigators on material matters important to the search of Ana Walshe. "He has pled not guilty to those charges and is currently being held at the Norfolk County correction. "A continued investigation has now allowed police to obtain an arrest warrant charging Brian Walshe with the murder of his wife.  "Mr Walshe will be transported to the Quincy District Court for arraignment for the charge of murder. "Additional details of the investigation and the evidence in support of those charges are likely to be presented at arraignment but will not be disclosed at this time." It comes as Mr Walshe was seen on surveillance video buying $450 worth of cleaning supplies at a home improvement store the day after his wife was last seen, a prosecutor said Monday at his arraignment on a charge of misleading investigators. Police also found a broken knife and blood in the basement of the couple’s Cohasset home, the prosecutor said, although she did not say whose blood it was. He was being held on $500,000 bond on a charge of misleading investigators in connection with the disappearance of Ana Walshe. A not guilty plea was entered on his behalf. Mr Walshe did not tell police he had been to the home improvement store, where he bought mops, buckets, tarps, tape and other items on January 2, Assistant Norfolk District Attorney Lynn Beland said at the hearing in Quincy District Court. He did tell police that he had been to a supermarket and a pharmacy when there is no evidence he had been to either store, she said. He misled investigators so he could either clean up or dispose of evidence, she said. Ana Walshe was reported missing by her employer in Washington, where the couple has a home and to which she often commutes during the week for work at a real estate company, authorities said. She was last seen leaving her home in the early morning hours of Jan. 1, purportedly to take a ride-hailing vehicle to Logan International Airport for a flight to Washington, police and prosecutors said. But police have found no indication that she either took a vehicle or boarded any flight out of Logan recently. Her cellphone has not been used and there has been no activity on her credit or debit cards, Cohasset police Chief William Quigley said at a news conference last week. Authorities searched a wooded area near the family's home on Friday and Saturday and then spent Sunday at the home. Brian Walshe had been on home confinement while awaiting sentencing in a fraud case involving the sale of fake Andy Warhol paintings, according to federal court records. Mr Walshe's arraignment may be as soon as 9am tomorrow dependent on defence attorney's availability.
