In 1964, the 250 GTO won the Tour de France Automobile – marking the ninth year in a row that Ferrari won that race. Only 36 of these cars were made between 1962 and 1963; the specific Ferrari that’s the most expensive in the world, at a whopping $70million price point, was victorious not only in the Tour de France, but it also placed in the Le Mans. With a top speed of 174 miles per hour and an acceleration of 0-60 mph (0-100 km/h) in 6.1 seconds, it's not the fastest, but it's timeless. The numbers drawn late Tuesday were: 25, 29, 33, 41, 44 and gold Mega Ball 18. The next drawing is scheduled to be held Friday night. The jackpot-winning drought isn’t surprising given the daunting odds of one in 302.6 million of winning the top prize.
