The UK's first ever space launch will push off from the runway at Spaceport Cornwall in a matter of hours. When many people will be heading to bed, experts on the ground in the West Country will be counting down the minutes, and the seconds, until lift-off at exactly 10.16pm. Final checks are now underway as dusk falls over Cornwall, with the Boeing 747-400 airliner, Cosmic Girl, sitting on the runway - ready for action. The mission, called Start Me Up, will carry satellites into orbit for seven different commercial and governmental customers from several nations, including a joint UK–US mission to study space weather phenomena. Instead of a conventional lift-off from the ground, Virgin Orbit is using a two-stage-to-orbit air launch, with the LauncherOne rocket to be first ferried 35,000 feet up into the atmosphere under its wing before being jettisoned to leave Earth's atmosphere under its own power. Crosswinds, however, are a concern to crews on the ground as this could pose an issue with take-off. And, if this is the problem, back-up launch windows have been pencilled in going into mid- and late-January. Start Me Up is a collaborative effort with the UK Space Agency (UKSA), the Royal Air Force, and Cornwall Council. In preparation for today’s launch, the 70-feet-long LauncherOne system has already been attached to the Cosmic Girl launch platform. Last Thursday saw Virgin Orbit successfully complete an end-to-end launch rehearsal, taking the rocket through the loading of fuel and on to a terminal count that confirmed the readiness of both the hardware and the launch team. A Virgin Orbit Spokesperson said: “Given the number of ‘firsts’ being executed for this launch — the first orbital launch from UK soil or from anywhere in western Europe — Virgin Orbit and its partners will maintain a conservative posture with regard to system health, weather, and all other elements of scheduling.” FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES
