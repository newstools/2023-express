A Mrs Hinch fan has hailed a popular product - available for as little as 79p - as the best way to transform yellow bedding so it comes up bright white. The woman asked how to keep bedsheets pristine on Facebook group Mrs Hinch Cleaning Tips, which boasts more than 627,000 members. In the Facebook post, she wrote: "What is the best washing method to keep them white - other than just a whites wash?" The community was united with its response, pointing out the product Dr. Beckmanns white sachets. The whitener tablets are available to purchase from a variety of stories, including the likes of Tesco, Wilko and Sainsbury's. At Asda they retail at the cost-effective price of 79p. People replied to the woman with a great deal of praise for the sachets. One person in the group said: "Dr. Beckmanns will definitely work - it always keeps the colour of mine." Another Facebook user wrote: "Dr. Beckmanns is certainly the one here, it has been good for us."   Others were keen to share different first-hand advice and opinion on efficient cleaning methods. One person said: "I always put Vanish for whites in my washes." On the other hand, someone suggested: "White vinegar in softener tray, bicarb, always white and smells lovely for longer. Doing this for years. Good luck." "Wrong time of year, but drying in the sunshine!" A third penned. A fourth wrote: "A scoop of Napisan."
