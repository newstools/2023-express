Holly Willoughby's glamorous outfits have been making headlines for more than a decade. Most famously, the 41-year-old sparked a frenzy wearing the iconic Grecian-style white dress in 2008, which showcased her enviable assets thanks to the plunging neckline. Almost 15 years later, the Dancing On Ice presenter has continued to defy critics with her incredible fashion choices, although some have not gone down too favourably with several unhappy viewers. In 2021, her pale pink feather gown was dubbed "too sexy" by some and ITV received 52 Ofcom complaints from those sharing their distaste at the dress. Back in 2013, while Holly presented The Voice, her sexy black dress which featured an incredibly low-cut neckline prompted 139 complaints. The BBC even had to issue an apology to those who found the dress "unsuitable".
