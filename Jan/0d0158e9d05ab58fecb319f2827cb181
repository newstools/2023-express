The state pension age is the earliest age a person can start receiving the state pension, which is a regular payment made by the Government depending on how many ‘qualifying years’ of National Insurance contributions a person has. However, the state pension age has been under review and changes are soon to be announced. From October 2020, the state pension age for both men and women rose to 66. There are currently two state pensions available, the basic state pension and the new state pension. The full basic state pension is currently worth £141.85 per week and is available to: The new state pension is currently worth £185.15 per week and is available to:  READ MORE: Over 60s at risk of longer wait for free bus pass  To receive any rate of state pension, people must have at least 10 qualifying years on their National Insurance record. The number of qualifying years on this record is used to determine how much state pension a person will receive but usually, to get the full rate, a person should have at least 35. However, both the age and payment rates are due to change soon, and here is the rundown. According to the Pensions Act 2014, which requires the Government to review the state pension age every six years, the current state pension age for men and women will increase to 67 between the years 2026 and 2028.

So, rather than reaching the state pension age on a specific date, people born between April 6, 1960, and March 5, 1961, will reach their state pension age at 66 years and a specified number of months. Below is an outline of how people of certain ages will be phased into the new state pension age of 67.

Under the current law, the state pension age is due to increase again from 67 to 68 between the years 2044 and 2046. However, this timetable could soon be changed by the Government. In December 2021, the Government launched the second periodic review of the state pension age, with a consultation document published in February 2022. An independent report led by Baroness Neville-Rolfe, and a report from the Government Actuary’s Department are due to be published, followed by a final report setting out the Government’s proposals. According to the House of Commons library, the deadline for this is May 2023. People can find out the earliest age they can claim the state pension by using a helpful tool on the Government website.

This will afford those who receive the state pension a 10.1 percent increase in their payments, in line with September 2022’s inflation rate. By honouring the triple lock, the highest percentage out of three different values (inflation, wage increases, and 2.5 percent) is used to determine how much the state pension will increase. This is to help ensure the state pension doesn’t lose value in "real" terms. As per the Government’s Autumn Statement factsheet, from April 2023, the full basic state pension will increase from £141.85 to £156.20 per week (£8,122.40 per year). The full weekly rate of the new state pension will increase from £185.15 to £203.85 (£10,600.20 per year).
