Carol Vorderman, 62, showed fans a rare insight into her family life as she uploaded an Instagram post featuring her son, Cameron King, 26, whom she shares with ex-husband Patrick King. The former Countdown star beamed during her New Year’s Day outing at Cheltenham Racecourse, which she described as the “perfect start to the year”. Carol looked elegant in a taupe fedora and a maxi trench coat in camel, which she wore over a black turtleneck jumper and matching leather trousers. She finished off the look with a pair of brown knee-high boots, while Cameron looked dapper in a navy suit and matching tie. The mum-of-two also uploaded a series of pictures of herself and friends who had attended the event alongside her.
