Sir Paul McCartney is the richest musician in the UK with a whopping wealth of £865 million, largely thanks to The Beatles being the most successful band in the history of music. However, he was only the second biggest British earner among his peers in 2022, making £45 million partly due to his Got Back tour and Glastonbury Festival appearance. The star who beat the 80-year-old made over double that amount in the past year. Incredibly, Gordon Sumner aka Sting, made £100 million in 2022, taking his total fortune up to £320 million. The Police legend achieved such a feat as Britain’s biggest earner among musicians last year, thanks to selling off his music catalogue to Universal. This is becoming an increasingly popular move for music stars, most recently taken by Justin Bieber for $200 million and Bruce Springsteen for $550 million.
