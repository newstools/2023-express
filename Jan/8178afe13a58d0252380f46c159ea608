Novak Djokovic has furiously hit back at claims he 'defied' the umpire in shooting off for a toilet break during his first-round match at the Australian Open. The Serbian tennis superstar was involved in a bizarre exchange during his opening match at Melbourne Park on Tuesday.  Cameras picked up Djokovic shouting 'Hello!' at the umpire as he tried to get their attention to inform them that he needed to go to the toilet. It was suggested at the time that he 'defied' the umpire by not even waiting for a response before running off the court. The tennis official could be heard shouting Djokovic's name as he made his way down the tunnel. But Djokovic has refuted any suggestion that he disregarded the rules in a furious post on social media. Djokovic reposted the clip of him running off the court during the match, which saw the umpire shout after him as he made his way down the tunnel. He wrote: "Eurosport, please get your informations checked before you post something judgmental and wrong."  The nine-time Australian Open champion then added further: “Chair umpire allowed me to go to toilet but she told me I don’t have toilet break, just change over break. So she told me (you didn’t capture that with camera) I had to hurry up. "When I almost exited the court, she called me (I didn’t hear) and it was to tell me that toilet was on the opposite side of the court. I found one where I went also, and I had to be quick because of the time.  "I didn’t ‘defy’ her or the rules. She gave me permission and told me to be quick. "Next time be mindful with what you post.
