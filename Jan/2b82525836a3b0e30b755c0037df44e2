Cristiano Ronaldo signed a mega-money deal to join Saudi Arabia side Al-Nassr last week, but the former Manchester United man came within touching distance of heading to Major League Soccer. Ronaldo left United in November after having his contract torn up, and the Portuguese icon wasn't as flush with choices as many thought he'd be. In the end, it appears Ronaldo had a simple choice on his hands - sign with Al-Nassr in the richest contract in football history, or join MLS side Sporting Kansas City. While SKC's offer didn't match up to the Saudi Arabian deal financially, there was still a lot of money on offer for him to move stateside. And according to a new report in the Kansas City Star, the team rolled out the red carpet for the 37-year-old, even enlisting NFL superstar Patrick Mahomes to try and help. Mahomes has become one of the most marketable players in the sport since being drafted by the Chiefs, and SKC apparently wanted to use that example to prove that despite being a small market, Kansas City could still give him the opportunity to earn big money. The NFL star apparently responded to SKC's request by saying: "Let’s do it. What do you need from me?” SKC manager Peter Vermes said: “I don’t look it as a negative. I look at it as a positive. The negative is a lot of people just know about it. But when you know about it, it becomes a positive. It’s not like you’re trying to hide away from it. Once you have the ability to explain the city, then it took on a positive connotation with the player. “He can’t go anywhere in those places. Here, he can live his life. He can go out. He can go eat dinner. He can have a life that he can’t have in other places. Which is a huge benefit.”
