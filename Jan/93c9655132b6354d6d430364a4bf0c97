Nicholas Bunclark fled from court after he was sentenced to 16 months behind bars. The sentence related to an attack at a hostel in Leyland Road, Southport, Merseyside, on November 19, 2021. The 30-year-old held his head in his hands as his sentence was read out at Liverpool Crown Court this morning (January 3), according to the Liverpool Echo. Bunclark exchanged a few words with his mum, who was in the public gallery, before he was led towards the cells. He reportedly vaulted over a gate and out of the dock after a brief tussle with officers. The escapee, from St Oswalds's Lane in Netherton, then fled the court. Security at the court was ramped up after his escape with Bunclark believed to have still been in the building. Guards were also seen outside the court in Derby Square with a number of cases adjourned due to the escape. Merseyside Police said in a statement: "Officers are appealing for help in locating a man who has fled the dock at Liverpool Crown Court this afternoon, Tuesday, January 3, after being jailed."Nicholas Bunclark from Liverpool was sentenced to 16 months for assault at Liverpool Crown Court this afternoon."If you see him, recognise him or know where he is, contact us via @MerPolCC on Twitter, ‘Merseyside Police Contact Centre’ on Facebook, or anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 with reference 369, Tuesday 3 January."
