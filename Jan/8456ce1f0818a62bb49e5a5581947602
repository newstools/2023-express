One angry poster wrote: “So every other Islander is allowed to have doubts about their couple except Zara? “They’re empathising with one another but laughing at her feelings behind her back. Only Will can see how Tom is wrong and no one else cares? Not me calling Ofcom.” Another fan posted: “If I have to watch another episode of them gaslighting Zara, I’m writing to Ofcom #loveislanText box two: While a third threatened to complain to Ofcom and posted: “This lot are acting dumb, If anyone gaslights one more time, I’m calling Ofcom.” One viewer even posted a mock-up of some of Love Islands' most fiery contestants which included Amber Rose Gill, Faye Winter, Maura Higgins and 2022 Love Island winner Ekin Su Colcologlu. The poster captioned the image: “We need these queens to stick up for Zara against these gaslighting girls.” It's not the first time Love Island hopefuls have been hit with gaslighting complaints.

Things came to a head when the islanders took part in Snog, Marry, Pie, one of the games they were asked to play. Both men pied Tasha and accused her of being "fake" with the incident sparking over 1500 complaints to Ofcom and resulted in both Dami and Luca apologising to the model. Some viewers felt the apologies given were weak and the boys were prompted to apologise by the producer of the show. Speaking to The Sun she said of the alleged bullying and the verbal attack that took place: “It’s such an intense environment and hard to escape. “You’re stuck in there together. I was ready to walk out.” She continued: “I kind of walked out. I said [to producers] ‘I’ve had enough.’ Andrew said: ‘I’m gonna go with you.’ “Then all of a sudden the boys apologised…it was a bittersweet moment.” Love Island airs weeknights on ITV2 at 9pm.
