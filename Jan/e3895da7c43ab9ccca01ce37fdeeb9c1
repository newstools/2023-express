William Saliba insists Arsenal are not feeling the pressure despite the chasing pack desperate to hunt down their eight-point lead. The 2-0 win against Tottenham means Arsenal face Manchester United on Sunday with the aim of knocking another of their rivals out of the race and making the title challenge a direct head-to-head with Manchester City. But the France international has no concerns about any of it.“There’s no pressure because we play for that,” he said. It’s better to have this pressure when you are at the top than when you are down at the bottom. It’s better to keep going like this and we don’t have to have pressure.“Eight points clear? It’s never enough. We know we have a lot of games to go.“We have to be focused because things can change quickly. If we lose one game, after we can have no confidence, so we  have to be focused on keeping going and trying to win. We focus on ourselves. “We know we have a big game next week. We know they beat us. They are the only team to beat us this season in the Premier League and we want to beat them again at home.“We will prepare for this game very well I think, and I hope we will win in front of our fans.“So we are focused on ourselves.Indeed, Saliba claims that the Arsenal players have no fewer tham five  reasons happy to have beaten Spurs in the north London derby on Sunday. So happy, in his own case, in fact, that he wants his representative to head into the club for further talks with the Arsenal board over an extension to his contract.“We are so happy because the derby is a big game, and it was an away game too,” he said, listing the first two.“We know it’s not easy to win at their stadium, so we are so happy,” he explained by way of a third reason. Then, taking the tally to five, he added: “ We didn’t concede one goal and we scored two.“I am so happy here. The club is speaking with my agent and me, the only thing I can do is focus on my football. I am so happy here.”
