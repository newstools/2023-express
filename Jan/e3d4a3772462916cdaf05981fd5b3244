Media baron Rupert Murdoch has been spotted with a new female companion within six months of divorcing his fourth wife. Shortly after signing the final papers with model and actress Jerry Hall, 66, the 91-year-old has been spotted on holiday with Ann-Lesly Smith, 66. Ms Smith is a one-time police chaplain and the window of US country music star Chester Smith. She was snapped with the media billionaire while soaking up the sun in Barbados. The pair reportedly met in November, and were spotted as they dined by a public beach. Mr Murdoch and his new companion were spending time on the Caribbean island after being invited by British billionaire Anthony Bamford - chairman of construction equipment manufacturers JCB - according to the Daily Mail. Ms Smith graduated from college in 1980 before entering into an abusive first marriage, which she later said led her to find God and become a volunteer police chaplain in Marin County, California. She works now as a local radio presenter, and told America’s Christian Broadcasting Network: “As I began to walk with God, the things of the world just seemed pointless to me.” While married to Chester, the pair released an album, Captured by Love, in 2005. Three years later he died of a heart attack at 78 years old. Mr Murdoch has been married four times previously.
