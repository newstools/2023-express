Prince Harry’s tell-all memoir hasn’t shaken Kate Middleton who appears “more confident than ever”, according to a body language expert. Kate has been out and about on recently, despite the storm surrounding the Duke of Sussex’s memoir, Spare. Within the 400-page best-seller, Harry alleges that Kate and Prince William encouraged him to don a Nazi uniform during a fancy dress party in 2005. The royal couple were said to have “howled with laughter” at Harry’s costume. An image of the young Prince wearing the offensive outfit then appeared on the front cover of The Sun. On her latest outing, Kate went to see a nursery school in Luton, Bedfordshire, where she engaged with young pupils keen to see the Princess of Wales. The 41-year-old was visiting the school as part of her work for the Royal Foundation Centre for Early Childhood, which she founded in 2012. The Daily Star spoke to behavioural expert Darren Stanton, who said Kate looked “unfazed” by the revelations in Prince Harry’s bombshell book.   “When someone is nervous, their voice pitch tends to go up or crack, however, while analysing videos of Kate from the day, her voice was completely on the same level, which denotes confidence”, he said. “Her posture appeared open and her eye contact was consistent with the non-verbal signals of a very confident person.” He continued: “She seemed very comfortable in her surroundings and her own skin. “While some people may expect them to be fazed, it’s business as usual for Kate and William.” READ MORE: GB NEWS SPARKS UPROAR AS SAMANTHA MARKLE LAUNCHES ANOTHER ATTACK ON SISTER MEGHAN Despite the international furore over the book, the Prince and Princess of Wales have remained tight-lipped.

The heir to the throne and his wife were not flustered by the barrage of questions, instead taking selfies with staff at the Merseyside hospital, which has just opened following several delays. Despite their assured appearance, Harry’s book has taken its toll on the pair’s popularity.
