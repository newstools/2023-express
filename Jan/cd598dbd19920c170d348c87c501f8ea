Salt Papi landed a huge left hand to end proceedings in the second round of his crossover boxing bout against Josh Brueckner on the KSI vs FaZe Temperrr undercard. From the off it was trademark Salt Papi as he effortlessly slid in and out of range, landing at will. Brueckner - a former professional MMA fighter and popular YouTube star - was unable to take advantage of his sizeable height and reach advantage throughout and was visibly hesitant from the off. Coming into the second, however, Brueckner stepped on the gas and began to back up the popular TikToker. But he was met with stark resistance as he was lured onto a massive straight left that sent him tumbling to the canvas. The American was unable to beat the count and the contest was waved off after one minute and thirty-three seconds of the second round.  Papi is quickly establishing himself as one of the best fighters in the crossover boxing scene and even impressed professional boxing star Chris Eubank Jr - who was on the broadcast team for his previous outing. “When I was watching him licking his lips in front of his opponent before the fight, I was like, ‘This kid’s got something,'" said Eubank Jr. "It became very clear early on with the foot movement, the in-and-out, that he’s been practicing his footwork. And then he hit him with the two-piece combo and the guy went to sleep, incredible. MORE BOXING NEWS...
