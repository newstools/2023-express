  Danni took to her Instagram story this week to reflect on her experience in view of her 107,000 followers, sharing a handful of photos to document her recovery. The first picture the presenter shared showed her sporting significant bruises on her eyes, cuts on her lip and through her eyebrow, as well as swelling to her face. She captioned the photo: "I don't want to trigger anyone but wow. I'm only just looking back on what went on a few months ago. Mental". The next image showed the property expert wearing a pear of sunglasses, with less bruising and swelling to her face. "Couldn't even think about sharing any pics at the time,” she added, before telling the Skinfluencer clinic that she was “so grateful” for “all their help”. A third picture showed Danni more recently, where she looked much more like her old self, with the caption: "And here's a current one so you're not left with those images of me".
