Audiences of Channel 4's 999:On the Front Line were left heartbroken after a recent episode showed paramedics entering a Staffordshire home, only to find an OAP doing CPR on her husband, who had sadly already died. It was revealed that wife Lillian had tried to resuscitate John, her husband, as they became stranded upstairs. Paramedics broke the door down to enter - and found her "physically exhausted" from attempting to bring him back to life. In the show, paramedics Sian and Paul swept on the scene to try and save John, aged 73, after an emergency call. The pair had to break glass to enter, and force open the back gate, reports BirminghamLive. Lilian said: "I came this afternoon and I rang the paramedics because I could see he was going down badly. I came up, I don't know what time it was, and that's how I found him. He's asthmatic, but we're wondering if it's coronavirus." Realising John had died, Sian said to Lilian, who had been with him 30 years: "It does look like John's gone, I'm afraid." Fighting back tears, Lilian said: "I know, I know." She called sister Sylvia and said: "John's passed away - the paramedics are here now." Lillian said: "John always helped me. He's been a brilliant husband.". She even shared a joke with Paul, as they had a cup of tea together. Paul apologised for breaking her gate to get in. She joked: "Was that you? So you're the one who'll have to have a smack." The ambulance backup team went about clearing up the broken glass and debris from the break-in. As they did so, Sian and Paul looked at Lilian's wedding photo. Paul said: "They can never take your memories away. You'll always have them, regardless of what happens. You can look at this and smile." Watch the full episode of 999: On the Front Line on Channel4.com
