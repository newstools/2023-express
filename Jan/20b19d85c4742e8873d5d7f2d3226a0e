The Gunners have been waiting on a series of deals during the current window and now boss Mikel Arteta is hoping a breakthrough is finally set to be made. Arsenal have relentlessly tracked Ukrainian winger Mykhalo Mudryk and at long last it appears that some form of breakthrough is being made. London rivals Chelsea have expressed a strong interest, but the Shakhtar man has a clear preference to be playing his football at the Emirates stadium. The only stumbling block remains the huge fee. Elsewhere Arteta is still keen to bolster his midfield ranks, with growing speculation linking the club to Sergei Milinkovic-Savic, who has long been tipped for a Premier League switch. A host of other names are on the transfer radar at the Emirates, and it should not be ruled out that s surprise bid or two could be lodged between now and the end of the month.
