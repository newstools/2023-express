Food-delivery company, Deliveroo, has teamed up with some of the UK’s most popular Asian restaurants to give away free food in celebration of the Year of the Rabbit. Teaming up with favourites like Dim T, Chopstix, YO! Sushi, Sushi Daily, Kokoro and Thaikhun, the company says they want customers to start the Lunar New Year feeling luckier than ever. Lunar New Year falls this year on Sunday, January 22, 2023, kicking off the Year of the Rabbit. As such, Deliveroo customers will reportedly be able to enjoy free food with every order - when they spend £30 from participating restaurants. The offer will be available on the Deliveroo app from Thursday 19th - Tuesday 24th January. Free dishes include gyozas (worth £7.35) from YO! Sushi, Bubble Tea (worth £5.95) from Yifang Fruit Tea, and Spring Rolls (worth £4.95) from Daddy's Dim Sum. "With over 20,000 Asian restaurants on the platform and cuisines from Thai to Chinese and Japanese, the category is a go-to for Deliveroo customers all year round", says Deliveroo. Data from the company revealed that the most ordered Asian dishes are Katsu Curry, Pad Thai, Chicken Chow Mein, Grilled Chicken Ramen and Pork Belly Ramen. The top sides are Egg Fried Rice, Prawn Crackers, Chicken Gyoza, Miso Soup and Chicken Satay.   Free dishes include gyozas (worth £7.35) from YO! Sushi, Bubble Tea (worth £5.95) from Yifang Fruit Tea, and Spring Rolls (worth £4.95) from Daddy's Dim Sum.  "We hope free items from our partners will bring some added excitement to customers celebrating the Lunar New Year at home," explained Sheng Goh, Head of Chinese Category from Deliveroo. "Whether it’s a free bubble tea or gyoza’s on the house, we hope to bring you some extra good fortune when delivering mouth-watering meals from your favourite Asian restaurants."
