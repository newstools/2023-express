A man has admited killing a mother and her two-year-old daughter then burying their bodies under the floor of his home in Dundee. However, Andrew Innes denies murdering Bennylyn Burke, 25, and her daughter Jellica, 2, on the grounds of diminished responsibility. The 52-year-old has also pleaded not guilty to charges of sexually assaulting Jellica, attempting to defeat the ends of justice plus a charge of raping another child. The High Court in Edinburgh heard that a post mortem concluded Bennylyn's death was the result of a single stab wound to the chest and blunt force head injuries. Prosecutor Frankie Morgan said that Innes had caused Bennylyn's death by stabbing her with a knife and repeatedly hitting her on the head with its handle, as well as with a hammer.
