 Salma, 56, stole the show at the premiere of Magic Mikeâ€™s Last Dance in Miami last night, competing with 11 shirtless men and Channing Tatum himself for attention on the red carpet. The mesh dress had a scattering of embroidered flowers but otherwise left the actress almost totally exposed and with her hair tied back in a high ponytail, Salma really had nowhere to hide. The embroidered flowers gave Salma's edgy look a hint of sophistication and femininity and she maintained her modesty with a matching black bra and panties. She paired the outfit with a bright green clutch, some gemstone necklaces and gold platform heels. Salma stars in the latest instalment of the sizzling Magic Mike franchise alongside its long-running star Channing Tatum, although this may be Mike's last appearance.
