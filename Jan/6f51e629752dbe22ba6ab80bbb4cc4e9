At some point, though there are disagreements over when, they restarted intimate relations. Despite this, Charles began a relationship with Lady Diana Spencer, whom he married to great aplomb in 1981. Their affair then became public knowledge in 1992 with the publication of Diana: Her True Story. This was followed by the "Camillagate" scandal in 1993. While this scandal had ramifications, Camilla's image in the eyes of the public changed as the century drew to a close.
