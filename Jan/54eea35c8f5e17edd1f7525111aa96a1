Three members of staff have been suspended by delivery giant DPD following "delays to deliveries" ahead of Christmas. The employees were "escorted from the premises" of the depot in Etruria, Stoke-on-Trent, after the decision. Residents across the region experienced long waits for parcels last month and, after Royal Mail announced strike action, DPD suspended its next-day delivery service. But the company says delivery standards are now returning to normal. Asked about the suspensions, a DPD spokesman said: "We can confirm that three members of staff have been suspended at our Stoke-on-Trent depot. "We experienced some delays to deliveries in the Stoke-on-Trent area over the Christmas period. But we can confirm that the service standards at the depot have now returned to the levels both we and our customers expect." More than 48,000 people work for DPD, which as Stoke-on-Trent Live reports, was founded in France in 1999. Royal Mail took strike action on four days last month; Members of the Communications Workers Union (CWU), voted for action by a significant majority - 97.6 per cent - at the start of the month. Dave Ward, the CWU General Secretary, said: "Royal Mail bosses are risking a Christmas meltdown because of their stubborn refusal to treat their employees with respect. "Postal workers want to get on with serving the communities they belong to, delivering Christmas gifts and tackling the backlog from recent weeks. "But they know their value, and they will not meekly accept the casualisation of their jobs, the destruction of their conditions and the impoverishment of their families." Speaking last month, a spokesman for Royal Mail said: "Their misguided belief that further industrial action, in a business already losing more than £1 million a day, will result in an improved pay offer is misleading its members and risking their long-term job security."
