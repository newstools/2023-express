Davina McCall, 55, set pulses racing as she stripped down to lingerie in a new series of photos. The Masked Singer judge gave the camera a fierce look while modelling the JD Williams pieces, which put her rock hard abs on full display. In one of the photos, Davina could be seen laying on her front and kicking her feet up as she candidly laughed in front of the camera. Davina flaunted her age-defying looks by opting for a natural makeup that highlighted her high cheekbones and sharp eyebrows. The TV presenterâ€™s simple look, which contrasted with her luxurious surroundings, was completed with her medium-length tresses styled in classic waves.
