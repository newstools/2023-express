There is "no trust left" between Prince Harry and the Royal Family following the Prince’s attacks on senior royals in his new memoir and in promotional TV interviews, a well-placed source has said. The Duke of Sussex has suggested reconciliation is possible while continuing to launch scathing attacks and leak intimate information. Harry painted William as a bully who was responsible for several vicious attacks against him. In his memoir Spare, Harry made the claim William "knocked" him to the floor, which he expanded on in his recent interview with CBS’ Anderson Cooper. He also told CBS Camilla was a "villain" who "sacrificed" him for her own PR campaign to get support for her affair with Charles. And he claimed Princess Kate made his wife Meghan cry during her wedding day after having a tiff over the choice of bridesmaid dresses. But Harry’s public communications have at times also implied a chance of reconciliation: In his memoir Spare, the Prince has described how he and William eventually came around to "wicked" Camilla. And in a less scathing interview with Good Morning America he also said she is not an "evil stepmother". While chatting to CBS, he also claimed reconciliation was achievable if the family took "accountability" for their actions.

The King and Prince William are said to be "exasperated" and "burning with anger" over Harry’s decision in his memoir Spare to reveal intimate details and private conversations that took place in the buildup to Megxit. A royal source told The Mirror: "The irony is there for all to see, apart from Harry himself it seems. "There was very little (trust) before these latest scenes, but there is no trust left at all for Harry to be brought into the fold." Harry claimed Prince William saw rage and pushed him to the floor, into a dog bowl after a row that took place in Kensington Palace in 2019.   He said the fight was down to a "buildup of frustration" on the part of William who was told "a lot of stories" about Meghan and Harry by his office and the tabloid press. Harry also said William grabbed his collar after their grandfather Prince Phillip’s funeral in April 2021. He wrote in Spare that his father pleaded for the pair of them not to make his life a "misery". Good Morning America asked Harry whether he felt his book would bring the family together or tear them apart. The Prince said: "I thought about it long and hard, and as far as I see it the divide couldn’t be greater before this book."    "I’m not angry anymore. There are things that will still anger me, but I’m not angry anymore, because I am exactly where I am supposed to be." Other experts and insiders have claimed Charles will completely "pull the plug" on the Duke of Sussex entirely after he "crossed" The King's "red line" because of his attacks on Camilla. According to an insider who spoke to The Sun before the release of Spare: "Camilla is Charles’s red line. If Harry trashes her then Charles could pull the plug, and Harry knows that." Royal author Phil Dampier said: "The King has always made it clear that the one thing he wouldn’t tolerate was criticism of Camilla, Prince Harry has crossed a red line with a cruel attack on the Queen Consort that has scuppered any hopes of a reconciliation with his father."
