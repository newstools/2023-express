Beijing views the Han Chinese-majority island democracy as a breakaway province and has not ruled out using force to bring Taiwan under Beijing's control. Not only is 2027 the date for the next National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), it is also the date which Japan has in mind when it comes to rearming. The Japanese Prime Minister, Fumio Kishida, recently completed a series of meetings in Europe and North America with defence in mind. 2027 also represents the next milestone for China's own military modernisation. That Tokyo and Taipei point to 2027 should serve as a wake-up call to policymakers as Beijing may sense a window of opportunity centred on the supply of Western weapons to Ukraine, and the fact the West is currently unlikely to be able to apply Russia-level sanctions to the CCP, given how interlinked China's economy remains with the West.Although the CCP is making slightly more amenable noises to the West as 'zero-Covid' winds down, Chinese military incursions across the median line of the Taiwan Strait are now occurring daily, seemingly with no end in sight.The fresh warnings come as a recent war game laid out the devastating impact of a war over Taiwan which involved the US. While headlines focused on the fact the CCP would likely fail, this would come at a debilitating cost to the US as well, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, with all sides experiencing “enormous” lossesPrevious war games have suggested China could edge a victory in a war with the US, and much depends on the participation of other countries.While the CSIS analysis may make for less comfortable reading for Beijing than Washington (it seems difficult to imagine the CCP surviving a total defeat in a war over Taiwan), it made clear that People's Liberation Army missiles would probably destroy US airbases as far away as Guam in the Pacific, while sinking American aircraft carriers. While US help would be critical for Taiwan, Japanese help would also seem to be essential for the US, echoing previous analyses that Japan will be critical in any conflict. Public opinion in both Japan and South Korea is now turning against China.Worryingly for Western policymakers however, the report also said: "The United States might win a pyrrhic victory, suffering more in the long run than the ‘defeated’ Chinese."This also comes as another expert has warned about US capabilities.Writing in the January issue of the US Naval Institute’s Proceedings magazine, retired US Navy captain Professor Sam J. Tangredi warned that in naval warfare, the bigger fleet almost always wins - an area where the PLA has an advantage, having surpassed the US Navy in 2020.Whatever technological advantages the US may have, it should be noted that thanks to years of outsourcing Western manufacturing, China would have a distinct edge when it comes to replacing its equipment. Indeed, according to the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies, in a war with China, the US Air Force would run out of advanced long-range munitions in less than two weeks.In the background, of course, is the supply of weapons to Ukraine, something which some analysts fear could compromise US weapons inventories.The CCP is only too aware of this, as well as the fact that China and the West have not yet fully decoupled their economies, meaning the chances of harsh sanctions are currently limited. Moreover, the CCP knows a blockade of Taiwan - if only a mini blockade to test the waters - could be crippling for both Taiwan and the US, especially in terms of electronics. All of this suggests a window of opportunity for the CCP, which would align with the timeline of 2027.As China experiences its first official population fall in decades, there may also be a demographic window for Beijing, while the CCP is only too aware - thanks to the 'one-child-policy' - that many Chinese families would be enraged at their only sons potentially being sent to die over Taiwan.The CCP has, of course, talked up the Taiwan situation for years, and the loss of face of not blockading or invading the island democracy could be too much to bear.Without control over Taiwan - being part of the 'first island chain' which effectively blocks China's dominance of the western Pacific - the CCP cannot hope to become the global power it aims to be.For the West, China taking Taiwan would totally alter the balance of power not only in the Asia-Pacific but in the wider world, with implications not only for US prestige in the region but even the status of the US Dollar as the global reserve currency.The stakes for all sides could not be higher, as Japan and Taiwan - on the ground as they are - clearly see something coming sooner rather than later.
