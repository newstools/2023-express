Thanasi Kokkinakis was left in shock after being mistaken for Nick Kyrgios in an awkward exchange at the start of his press conference following his win over Fabio Fognini at the Australian Open on Wednesday. After the moderator opened the floor to any questions, the reporter started: "Hi Nick."  This prompted a hilarious reaction from Kokkinakis as he couldn't believe the mistaken identity. Kokkinakis repeatedly said "wow" before adding while laughing: "That is you done. Off you get." The Aussie then jokingly added: "That is s***house from you." The reporter tried to explain himself for the case of mistaken identity, stating his question was about Kyrgios no longer being a part of the tournament. Kokkinakis was told: "Nick is out, so you are the favorite for the Greek Aussies." Still reeling from the earlier exchange, Kokkinakis quickly replied: "I hope so. I am the only one left (laughter)." The reporter was finally able to get to the question he wanted to ask, quizzing the 26-year-old whether he had a message for the Greek Aussies and how much support he feels he needs from them. "You should ask Nick (laughter)," Kokkinakis joked. "No, no, I'm happy. Efharisto [Thanks in English]. That's all I can say. "Thank you for coming out and supporting. I love the Greek support here. It's good.  "I get the best of both worlds being in Australia. A lot of Greek population, especially in Melbourne. "I'm super happy when they come out and support me. "Aussies, Greeks, anyone else, if they want to support me, I'm all for it. "It's great having their support, and hopefully I can keep riding the wave." Kyrgios even caught wind of the exchange as the video gained traction on social media, posting a one-word response on Twitter. He simply wrote "Kyriakis" while re-posted the video to his Twitter account.
