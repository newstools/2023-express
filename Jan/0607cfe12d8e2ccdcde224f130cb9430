The Daily Show made a triumphant return to Comedy Central in the USA on Tuesday night following long-serving host Trevor Noah’s departure last year. Leslie Jones was a natural as she took on the role of guest host during the episode, providing hilarious takes on the latest news headlines as well as interviewing guest Morris Chestnut. In fact, Leslie proved such a hit that some have called for her to be made a permanent fixture on the show. As it stands, Leslie is heading up a long list of guest hosts billed to front The Daily Show in the coming weeks. While she keeps her spot in the host’s chair for the rest of the week, the likes of Wanda Sykes, DL Hughley, Chelsea Handler and Sarah Silverman will also enjoy stints in Trevor’s old seat. But after kicking off Tuesday with humorous takes on Boston’s newly unveiled Martin Luther King Jr statue as well as her hilarious interview style with Morris, fans feel Comedy Central has found its natural replacement for Trevor. Taking to Twitter during Tuesday’s episode, Daily Show fan Manolo Travieso praised: “#TheDailyShow with Leslie Jones was FUNNY. Great Job Leslie Jones!!!!!!! @TheDailyShow great job!” READ MORE: Nico Parker hits out at The Last of Us casting backlash 'I don't care' While @MessyMindofMe agreed: “Omg leslie jones on #TheDailyShow is amazing and she looking gorgeous!!!” Elsewhere, @BevHaut pleaded with show bosses: “The one and only @Lesdoggg is the ONE host who could pull me back into #TheDailyShow!

Love your podcast, your social media posts, and now your knocking it out of the park while hosting the daily show!! “You really do need your own show. It would be so awesome if you were on HBO so you can be your uncensored self.” (sic) Anticipation for Leslie’s stint on The Daily Show was already sky-high prior to Tuesday’s show thanks to Comedy Central’s promo. Teasing her upcoming appearance, Leslie said in the trailer for her upcoming shows: “What’s up, everybody? I’m Leslie Jones.

Her CV also boasts a number of other high-profile roles, including the all-female reboot of Ghostbusters in 2016. Leslie has also starred in Coming 2 America, The Blacklist, BMF and Our Flag Means Death. The Daily Show airs weeknights at 11/10c on Comedy Central and Paramount+ in the USA.
