Shakira, 45, has been making her feelings clear about her bitter split from her ex-husband Gerard Pique, 35, in recent weeks, even releasing a diss track. The Columbian singer has now been pictured smiling to her fans in a casual ensemble from her Barcelona balcony. This comes as it has been reported that Shakira had begun construction on a wall to separate her home from that of her mother-in-law after her split from Gerard. The Spanish property she formerly shared with Gerard is connected in some areas to that of her former in-laws and she is seeking to separate them, according to Marca. Shakira also set up a terrifying lifesize witch doll on the same balcony which reportedly looks over her former in-law's house.
