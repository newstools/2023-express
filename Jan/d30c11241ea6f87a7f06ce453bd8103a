His was a powerful voice in calling for weapons to repel Putin's invasion and whereas some European leaders were less than enthusiastic about rallying to Ukraine's cause, Mr Johnson never wavered. We are a first-world nation but you would never know it from the state of our potholed roads. And now, after the Express produced a damning dossier showing the extent of this appalling state of affairs, experts are predicting that it will take £13billion and at least a decade to make the necessary repairs. Predictably, local councils are blaming the Department of Transport and the Department of Transport is covering itself by stressing how it has promised to spend £500million to fix the problem. Meanwhile, motorists are paying the price. The frustration is made worse by the sight of cones narrowing roads down to one lane when absolutely no repair work is going on. Getting about this country is becoming a minefield, whether it's by rail or road. It's not just a squeeze on budgets that's to blame. It's incompetence.  One of the great sadnesses of the Queen's final years was the spectre of her son Prince Andrew making headlines for all the wrong reasons. Now we hear Andrew intends to take legal action to clear his name and force his nemesis Virginia Roberts to issue a formal apology for claiming he had underage sex with her. Lawyers in America have laughed this out of court but it comes just as Ghislaine Maxwell - in jail for helping paedophile Jeffrey Epstein procure young girls - says that the infamous photograph of Andrew with his arm around the then 17-year-old Roberts is a fake and that she has "no memory" of them ever meeting. We think Andrew should knuckle down and find other ways to rehabilitate himself.
