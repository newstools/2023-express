Prince Harry said the original transcript of his autobiography, Spare, was twice as long as the final, 416-page draft. A large part of the content he decided not to include, the Duke of Sussex said in a newly-released interview, concerned interactions between himself, Prince William and King Charles. Speaking to the Telegraph's Bryony Gordon, Harry said the "hard bit" was choosing what to take out of the book. Explaining why he didn't disclose some of his exchanges with his closest royal relatives, the Duke said: "There are some things that have happened, especially between me and my brother, and to some extent between me and my father, that I just don’t want the world to know." He added he doesn't think the pair "would ever forgive me" if he did make those revelations. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES…
