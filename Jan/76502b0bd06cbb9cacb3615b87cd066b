Nearly a third of England and Wales residents who gave Christianity as their religion are 65 and over – it was more than 20 percent a decade ago. Most young adults say they do not have a faith, says Office for National Statistics analysis of the 2021 census. At 51, the median age of Christians was up from 45 in 2011 and the oldest average of all main religious groups. Analysts put the rise down to an ageing population and changes in how people identify themselves. The youngest average was 27, for people identifying as Muslim – up from 25. The average age of those calling themselves Hindu rose from 32 to 37, the same as Sikhs, while followers of Buddhism were on average 43 – up from 37. People identifying as Jewish had an unchanged average of 41. The proportion of the population aged 21 to 25 and Christian fell from 5.1 percent to 3.9 percent.  Dr Stephen Hance, CofE national lead on evangelism, rejected the idea that younger people lacked interest in Christianity: “Our own research on prayer last year found that younger people actually appear to be more likely to pray than older generations. “We certainly don’t underestimate the need to connect with Generation Z [11 to 26-year-olds]. Younger people today are less likely to have been brought up in the Christian faith. “While they may be less familiar with its message that doesn’t mean they are less open to faith.” The average age of people reporting no religion increased from 30 to 32. Just 8.8 percent of them were 65 and over – whereas that age group forms 18.6 percent of the total population. Less than half the population of England and Wales were Christian in 2021, the first time it was below half. The charity Humanists UK said data underlined “the archaic place that collective worship and faith-based discrimination have in our schools”.
