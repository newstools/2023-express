LeBron James has decided he wants to retire as a member of the Los Angeles Lakers, making the no-trade clause in his contract redundant. James has a clause in his current deal meaning he can't leave before next summer at the earliest. James' future has been a subject of speculation throughout the season, with the Lakers megastar closing in on the NBA all-time scoring record. The 38-year-old signed a new contract before the season started to ensure he stays with the Lakers until 2025. In that contract, the Lakers and James agreed to a 'no-trade clause', meaning no matter how bad things might get for him, the Lakers can't send him to another team. That clause expires at the end of the season, however, and there has been speculation he could choose to depart before long and move to another team. That speculation was ramped up when James declared an intention to play alongside his son, Bronny, who is expected to be eligible for the draft in 2024. Despite his desire to share the locker room with Bronny, however, James is apparently determined to stay with the Lakers until he calls time on his career. Speaking on his podcast, ESPN's NBA insider Zach Lowe stated he believed James was angling towards finishing his career in purple and gold. He said: ""I keep hearing he wants to stay with the Lakers. He wants to finish his career with the Lakers. "His comments, though, should be interpreted as his patience is not infinite, and if this is just a continued morass of losing, maybe that changes. But if you force me to bet, I’d still bet on him finishing his career with the Lakers. And I’d feel pretty confident in that."
