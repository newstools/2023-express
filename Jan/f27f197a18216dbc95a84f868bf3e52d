A Place In The Sun's Jonnie Irwin was left devastated after learning the cancer had spread to his brain, and being told he had just six months left to live. The TV presenter, who is just 49, will leave behind his wife Jessica Holmes and their three toddler children - Rex, aged three, and twins Rafa and Cormac, both two. So far, Jonnie has beaten his original prognosis, and is still enjoying watching his children grow up. However, the memories they make will be bittersweet, as he faces the reality of a terminal diagnosis. The family enjoyed visiting a stable of horses in the countryside as they celebrated the last part of the festive season recently, with Jonnie updating his Instagram followers with all the news.
