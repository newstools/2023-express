It could be a busy Sunday for Manchester United with just three days remaining until the January transfer window slams shut. The Red Devils recorded a comfortable 3-1 victory over Reading in the FA Cup fourth round on Saturday to ensure they will still be fighting in four competitions heading into February. If they are to be competitive on all fronts, however, they may well need further additions to their squad, and there will no doubt be work going on behind the scenes to try to give manager Erik ten Hag a nice last-minute surprise. The Dutch boss himself recently made his thoughts clear on the matter, telling reporters:Â "In the coming days, if we had the opportunity I would go for it but that's not also up to me, that's also clear. I think this club always has to have the approach that every day you have to get better so if there are opportunities to get better then you have to strike. "That's my approach so I'm looking around, to research but I have an idea with which profiles we could strengthen the squad." So, having already secured the signings of backup goalkeeper Jack Butland and striker Wout Weghorst, will there be any more fresh faces through the door in the coming days?
