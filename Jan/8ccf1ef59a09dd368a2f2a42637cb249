Nicola Peltz and Selena Gomez looked like the best of friends as they cuddled up together while enjoying the sunshine and having a good time at sea. The billionaire heiress took to Instagram yesterday to share a series of snaps of the pair alongside her husband Brooklyn Beckham, 23, and other friends. Nicola and Selena could be seen making a series of poses in their bikinis and smiling for the camera while having some drinks on deck. The pictures showed the two friends sporting matching white swimwear, with Selena wearing a bandeau-style top and Nicola pairing her triangle bikini with her headband. In one of the snaps, Selena and Nicola threw their arms in the air while pouting and wearing all-white clothes to match their bikinis. The photos come after Nicola and Brooklyn reignited family feud rumours, as they spent Christmas with the actress' family, away from the Beckhams, and neglected to return to the UK for New Year's Eve, instead travelling to Los Cabos, Mexico.
