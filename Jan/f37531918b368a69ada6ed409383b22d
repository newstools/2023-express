Tom Brady's Tampa Bay Buccaneers career likely came to an end on Monday night in a devastating defeat to the Dallas Cowboys, and some NFL fans believe it's time for the iconic quarterback to call time on his career - for good. Brady and the Buccaneers were shut out entirely in the first half of Monday Night Football, which was the first time Brady has failed to score in the first half of a post-season game since his Play-Off debut in 2001. The Buccaneers were dire against the Cowboys, who were poor on special teams and failed to convert any of their first four extra point attempts. Things got so bad for the Buccaneers that fans started leaving in large numbers during the fourth quarter. The defeat leaves Brady as a free agent for just the second time in his career, and there's now speculation over where he will be next season. The 45-year-old retired briefly last year, and had been expected to play for just one more season when he reversed that decision. A return to the New England Patriots had been mooted, and there has been speculation linking him with the Las Vegas Raiders. However, NFL fans believe the time has come for Brady to retire for good now and take up a job as an analyst. Brady has a contract on the table from Fox Sports to work for them worth $375million (£307m), which will become active as soon as he retires from playing. During Monday night's game, fans flooded social media with calls for Brady to call time on his incredible career. "Brady is really finished terrorizing the NFL," one wrote. Another posted: "I love Tom Brady, respect his career so much. But it’s time to retire. You could see it in the final season from Brees, Big Ben, Peyton Manning, and now Brady. It’s time." One fan wrote: "Just retire, Tom Brady. You've done enough. No need to be a masochist. Losing in a playoff game is respectable. Go to the broadcast booth."
