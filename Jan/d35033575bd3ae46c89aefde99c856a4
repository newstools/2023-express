It has been reported previously by Newsweek that young Britons in the UK are no longer fully supportive of the Royal Family - like past generations were. This comes are reports that the younger generation are not becoming more conservative, breaking previous trends that took over the UK and the US. John Burn-Murdoch stated that there is a changing opinion among millennials. Mr Burn-Murdoch wrote: "If millennials' liberal inclinations are merely a result of this age effect, then at age thirty-five, they too should be around five points less conservative than the national average and can be relied upon to gradually become more conservative. "In fact, they're more like 15 points less conservative." He pointed out that the UK and the US are by "far the least conservative 36-year-old's in recorded history". He suggests that the change may be a result of the 2008 financial crash.
