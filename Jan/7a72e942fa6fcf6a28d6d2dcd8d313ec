Holly Willoughby, 41, debuted her new hairdo on Monday's This Morning after letting her eight-year-old son, Chester, cut inches off her locks. On Sunday, Holly shared a clip of Chester chopping her hair with the help of an anonymous woman. In the clip Holly could be heard saying: "Are you ready Chester? Make it nice and straight!" The following morning Holly shared a snap of her outfit for This Morning and showed off her shorter hairstyle. She wore a collared, floral mini dress which she paired with nude court heels and pulled one side of her hair over her ear. Her return to the show marked the first time her and Phillip Schofield have hosted since before the Christmas break.
