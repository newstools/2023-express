If you've been thinking about switching your iPhone to something new, now is a good time to go shopping. EE has just launched its big Winter Sale event with the UK network slashing the price of the popular iPhone 13 by up to £144. It's rare that EE drops prices - especially on the iPhone - and that's not all the firm is offering its users. Along with cutting the monthly cost, some plans are also offering six months of access to goodies such as Apple Music and Apple TV+ for free. That means those signing up today won't pay a penny to use this premium music and telly boosting services until July 2023. There's a whole swathe of iPhone 13 plans available in the EE sale including ultimate unlimited options with things starting from £43 per month. All of the deals include fast 5G data speeds, plus the ability to gift any spare internet access you have remaining each month to other members of the family. If that sounds enticing then you'll find our top pick of EE deals on the iPhone 13 below.

In fact, customers can currently take advantage of the ultimate unlimited SIM - which includes all-you-can-eat data, calls and texts - and pay a whopping 50 percent less than before. There are two unlimited options to choose from including a SIM with download speeds capped at 100Mbps or the option to always get EE's best 5G connection. The capped plan is now just £14 per month whilst going for the ultimate speeds, which can be in excess of 300Mbps, will be charged just £18 per month. Those ludicrously low prices are available for the first six months of the 24-month contract with things then rising to the standard price.
