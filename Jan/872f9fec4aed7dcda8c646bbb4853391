A speeding BMW driver who killed two young boys by driving dangerously has changed his pleas to guilty - after shamelessly "playing the system" for months. Jack Hart, 32, "left it to the last possible minute" to admit his actions caused the deaths of Steven Duffield, 10, and Mason Deakin, 11, who were knocked off their bicycles. Hart's refusal to admit his guilt earlier greatly increased the anguish of the bereaved families, Hull Crown Court court heard. He will now be sentenced for two counts of causing death by dangerous driving. He has been refused bail until the next hearing, Hull Live reports. Judge John Thackray KC said: "He has had two years to get his affairs in order. "He has played the system and left it to the last possible minute. His plea has come over two years later than it should have done." Hart had been speeding in his BMW at the time of the accident and had driven into a bus lane. He later removed a dashcam, the court heard. The crash happened in Hull on November 2, 2020, along a busy stretch of road. The boys, who were best friends, were rushed to hospital but died within two weeks of the collision. The court was told Hart entered not guilty pleas at his first hearing in June last year but this week, on the first day of his trial, he finally admitted the charges. Charlotte Baines, defending, said the man had "contravened a bus lane" and had been speeding before the "fatal collision". "He has been on bail throughout," said Miss Baines. "There has been no difficulty with him surrendering to bail throughout the proceedings." She added that she wanted to collect character references and information from a "health specialist" who had been working with him. But bail was declined and Hart, from Hull, will be sentenced at a later date.
