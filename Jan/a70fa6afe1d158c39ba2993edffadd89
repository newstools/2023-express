Anyone wanting to make a quick buck might want to check out a new service from Tesco Mobile. The UK provider has just launched a way of trading in old gadgets with customers then being offered cash or Tesco vouchers in return. If you have an old iPhone, iPad or Android device such as a Samsung Galaxy or Google Pixel, the process is pretty seamless. You simply need to head to the Tesco Mobile website and enter a few details about the device such as make, model, if there's any damage and the device's IMEI number. An instant price is then shown on the screen with Tesco joining forces with Assurant to provide the free valuation. If it looks fair, you'll then need to pop the phone in the post for the team to inspect. Once the device has been checked for damage and overall condition the cash or gift vouchers will be transferred within around five working days. It's all pretty simple and could be a quick way of making some money out of any old devices lying around your home. Tesco says the initiative forms part of its ongoing commitment to sustainability and value for customers. READ MORE: Excited about the new Galaxy S23?

Partnering with Assurant is just another way we’re helping our customers save money – by turning their old mobiles or tablets into cash or vouchers. It’s also an opportunity to help reduce waste by enabling the resale of used devices, reducing the number of mobile phones in landfill."

Other sites that feature this service include MusicMagpie, Mazuma and Sell my Mobile. Some tech firms such as Apple and Samsung will also give you money back when upgrading to a new smartphone so do your research before handing over any old tech.
