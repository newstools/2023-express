  Michelle was all smiles as she attended the screening of the third and final Magic Mike film alongside her husband Hugh Hanley, Dancing On Ice partner Łukasz Różycki and his pro skater wife Alexandra Schauman. The star showed off her incredibly toned arms and legs in a silky, black dress with a high neckline and a skirt decorated with black and pink feathers. She completed her look with some sky-high, stylish, metallic blue and pink stiletto heels. Michelle and Łukasz became the latest couple to leave Dancing On Ice on Sunday, after their routine to All That Jazz from Chicago failed to impress the judges. Magic Mike's Last Dance will air in UK cinemas on February 10.
