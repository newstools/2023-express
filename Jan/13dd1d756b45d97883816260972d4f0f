Amanda Holden, 51, showed off her latest stylish ensemble at the Heart FM studios in London on Thursday morning. The Britain's Got Talent judge donned an electric blue maxi skirt paired with a long-sleeved crop top. Amanda flashed a hint of leg in her Pretty Lavish co-ord which feathured a thigh high split. She completed the look with a pair of grey knee-high boots from LK Bennett. Speaking to her 1.8 million followers, Amanda said: “I don’t know about you but I really feel like January is dragging and the weather is horrendous! So I thought I would add a pop of colour to my day today to cheer things up a bit.”
