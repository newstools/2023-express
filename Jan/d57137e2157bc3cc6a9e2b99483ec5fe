There was of course plenty of criticism of the Royal Family, including Harry’s father’s parenting skills and his brother’s attitude towards him. There was also the serious but unsubstantiated allegation that his family regularly briefed the media against him and Meghan. But in spite of all that, Harry also held out a few olive branches amid suggestions that the King wants to reconcile his warring family before the Coronation. He tackled perhaps the most damaging allegation, that the Royals are inherently racist. His family and their aides may think it a shame that he and Meghan have waited 22 months since their interview with Oprah Winfrey to make it clear they were never suggesting that in citing family remarks about their son Archie’s skin colour. But all the same that clarification will be welcome. Harry also defended Lady Susan Hussey, the senior courtier forced to quit after repeatedly questioning a black British campaigner about where she really came from. He insisted he was open to reconciliation but still suggested he wanted peace on his and Meghan’s terms. His family might take comfort from him admitting publicly for the first time that he and Meghan might have got things wrong. He held out the prospect of coming to Britain for the Coronation and supporting the King in his work under the right circumstances. But the problem remains that the late Queen, supported by the then Prince Charles and Prince William, decided he and Meghan could not be half in and half out. It is hard to see the King changing course on that.
