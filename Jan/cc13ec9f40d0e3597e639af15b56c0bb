Prince Harry has criticised his stepmother Camilla in his memoir Spare and branded her media connections as “dangerous” during an interview with CBS’ 60 Minutes to promote his book. But do you think the Duke of Sussex has gone too far with his attacks on the Queen Consort? Vote in our poll.  Harry told Anderson Cooper how after Camilla married his father in 2005 she had to work hard to find her place in the Royal Family and improve her reputation. He said: “She was the villain, she was a third person in the marriage, she needed to rehabilitate her image. He added: “The need for her to rehabilitate her image…that made her dangerous because of the connections that she was forging within the British press. And there was open willingness on both sides to trade information and with a family built on hierarchy, and with her on the way to being Queen Consort, there was going to be people or bodies left in the street because of that.” READ MORE: Prince Harry's claims of Camilla 'planting stories' shut down Royal biographer and editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine, Ingrid Seward spoke about the comments with The Mirror, explaining: “Prince Harry’s attacks on his stepmother the Queen Consort are unnecessary and gratuitously nasty. Camilla has never been anything but kind to Harry and took great care to keep out of his orbit.” She also spoke about how Camilla might view Harry's comments, adding: “Of course, she will be hurt by his petty slurs, but she won't hold it against him. Instead, she will view Harry as the sad and confused case he appears to have become.” Buckingham and Kensington Palace are yet to comment on the claims made against the Firm and members of the Royal Family in Spare.
