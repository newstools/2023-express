Mr Sunak admitted a “brief error of judgement” after not wearing a seatbelt in a video clip filmed for his Instagram account to promote levelling-up funding in Lancashire. His spokesperson said: “The Prime Minister believes everyone should wear a seatbelt. It was an error of judgment; he removed it for a short period of time to film a clip, which you’ve seen, but he accepts that was a mistake.” A spokesperson for Lancashire Police said: “We are aware of the matter and we will be looking into it.” READ MORE: Police 'looking into' video of Sunak not wearing seatbelt Conservative MP for Blackpool South, Scott Benton, said Lancashire Police were wasting time looking into the incident, continuing: “The vast majority of people would think that politically motivated complaints about a seatbelt are not a good use of frontline resources. Their time is better spent investigating serious crime which impacts on my constituents.” The Labour Party said it would be “very serious” if Mr Sunak was fined for this offence after already paying a fixed-penalty notice as Chancellor for the Partygate scandal. Figures released by the Department for Transport show 30 percent of people killed in cars on Britain’s roads in 2021 were not wearing a seatbelt. So what do YOU think?
