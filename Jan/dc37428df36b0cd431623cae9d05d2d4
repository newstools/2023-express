The Welsh singer was invited to tour the 75,000 square-foot entertainment and casino venue in Leicester Square after celebrating her 86th birthday on Sunday. The Hippodrome first opened as a dinner theatre called Talk of the Town in 1958. Dame Shirley previously performed as part of the Talk of the Town dinner theatre shows during her rise to fame. The likes of Dame Julie Andrews, Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, Sir Cliff Richard, Sir Bruce Forsyth and Dame Shirley headlined before the shows ended in 1983. The Hippodrome name was revived that year and used as a disco until 2012, when the Hippodrome Casino was opened by Boris Johnson when he was Mayor of London. Dame Shirley said on Tuesday: “I am thrilled to be returning to the Hippodrome for the first time in half a century. It has a very special place in my heart and in my life. “I will always remember my performances here on Talk of the Town on a stage that has hosted the likes of Judy Garland and Sammy Davis Jr. It’s wonderful to be back.”
