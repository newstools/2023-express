Fortnite fans are getting ready for the release of update 23.30 on PlayStation consoles, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, Android and PC. The next Fortnite update will make countless bug fixes and gameplay tweaks. Unfortunately, however, the new update will be accompanied by a period of server downtime, which is likely to last for at least a couple of hours. If you want to know when you can start logging back into Fortnite, check out the 23.30 downtime schedule below. Fortnite update 23.30 will be available to download from 9am GMT UK time on the morning of January 31. Matchmaking will begin to be disabled at 8.30am, while servers will be taken offline in full at 9am GMT. The news was announced by Epic Games on Twitter, alongside a preview of what fans can expect. "Prepare to power up in v23.30!" reads a Fortnite tweet. "Downtime begins at 4AM ET, with matchmaking being disabled shortly before." If it's anything like previous periods of server downtime, then Fortnite is likely to come back online at around 11am GMT. Express Online will keep this article updated with all the latest developments, including confirmation on when the game is back online. As part of update 23.30, Epic Games will launch a second crossover with the Dragon Ball series. According to insiders such as Shiina, the Dragon Ball crossover will add Son Gohan and Piccolo skins to the game. The new update will also see the Rift Gate progress, as well as adding to the Boombox v2, which is believed to be a Guitar. "The Guitar is supposed to be the Boombox v2," Shiina tweets. "You have to hit the beat to do 75 damage to all builds nearby you, and it has a tempo of 3 beats per second." Needless to say, new skins and items will be added to the item shop, alongside the February Crew Pack.
