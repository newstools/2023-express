Peyton Manning joked the Dallas Cowboys should cut kicker Brett Maher at half-time of their Wild Card game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, after he missed three field goals in the first half on Monday Night Football. The Cowboys rushed to an early lead against the Buccaneers, scoring three first-half touchdowns while keeping Tom Brady quiet. The Bucs had no answer for the Cowboys defense, and were consistently unable to get the ball down the field. Dak Prescott, on the other hand, had no trouble carving open the Bucs' defence and making plays, throwing for two touchdowns and rushing one in himself during the opening two quarters. But unfortunately for the Cowboys, their efforts on offense weren't supported by the special teams, with Maher missing three kicks. In doing so, he became the first player in NFL history to miss three extra points in a Play-Off game. It wasn't just Cowboys fans who were in disbelief, either. NFL icon Manning had to walk away from his screen after seeing the third attempt sail wide of the posts. Manning, who was working with his younger brother Eli for ESPN, questioned why the Cowboys were still attempting extra points instead of going for two. After getting out of his seat and striding over to his television, Manning barked: "Oh my God, you've got to be kidding me. Why are we kicking it? Why are we kicking it? Can you cut a guy at half-time in a Play-Off game?" Manning wasn't alone in questioning how the Cowboys could make so many mistakes with their kicking. NFL legend Deion Sanders was left in disbelief after watching the first of Maher's three attempts. Speaking to the ManningCast, he said: "How do you miss an extra point when that's the only job you've got? How do you do that?" Maher went on to miss a fourth extra point attempt in the third quarter of the game, with the Cowboys leading 24-0.
