Helena Christensen was seen showing her supermodel credentials on Instagram today while promoting a sale of her swimsuits. The Danish star wore her hair slicked back in a high bun while adding pink eyeshadow to her glamorous look. The model exhibited her jaw-dropping figure in a black bikini with two racy cutouts, before slipping into a red two-piece, both available to buy via her brand, Staerk And Christensen. She soon changed into another black swimsuit, as well as a cream ensemble and a purple minidress while posing in a Flashdance-inspired shoot. In her caption, the runway veteran wrote: "A Flashdance kind of Sunday, 2nd hand sale this week @staerkandchristensen.' Samanthany2la91 remarked: “You are stunning and in magnificent shape. Can you share your exercise routine?”
