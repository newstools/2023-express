Rita Ora, 32, stunned yesterday as she showcased her taut stomach during her sun-soaked St Barts holiday. The singer looked fabulously casual in a light yellow triangle bikini and a number of accessories to complement the beachy look. Rita posed with her hand on her leg as she looked away from the camera among the greenery in the spectacular tropical destination. The pop star, who still had wet hair, decided to go barefoot as she showed off the print of a topless woman on her bag. She accessorised the casual look with a number of bangles and rings, as well as anklets and a chunky choker.
