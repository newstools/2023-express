When Baz Luhrmann's Elvis movie was released last year, the soundtrack included a ton of Elvis Presley covers and reimagings by celebrity fans from Jack White to Stevie Nicks. There's even a remix of Crawfish with Fever and now another has been released in the form of Toxic Las Vegas. The Jamieson Shaw Remix brings together The King's title track for his 1964 movie Viva Las Vegas with Britney Spears' 2003 hit Toxic and fans can enjoy listening to it here.
