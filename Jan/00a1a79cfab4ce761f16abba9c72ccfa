However, any Barclays customers concerned about the pending changes will still be able to access vital in-person services. To help those who may find it difficult to use online banking, the bank has set up a support van and pop-up banks. These services will be accessible to Barclays customers on certain dates and times of the day. Customers who are impacted by the branch closures can find more information on the support van and pop-up banks on the bank’s website. Examples of what people can do via the Post Office include withdrawing cash, checking bank balances and depositing cheques. Other banks which have announced closures in the past few months have included HSBC, Lloyds, NatWest, Santander, Halifax and Nationwide, which has confirmed one of its branches will shut down.

Tobias Gruber, the founder and CEO of My Community Finance, commented: “It’s becoming increasingly common for banks to close their high street branches as more customers shift to online and digital banking methods. “In the case of Barclays, the closure of these branches will result in cost savings for the bank, so I hope they choose to re-invest in improving their digital and telephone banking services for their loyal customers, as well as providing more ‘pop-up’ banks and support vans for their rural customers who may not have access to the internet. “If you’re a Barclays customer and need branch access and don’t have alternative services nearby, you might want to consider switching to a bank with a physical branch in your area - although there are no guarantees that they will remain open for long.”
