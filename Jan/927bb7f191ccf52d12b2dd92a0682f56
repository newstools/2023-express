Expectant mum Maya (Hannah John-Kamen) and partner Jamie (Douglas Booth) think they’ve found the perfect getaway from their violent London estate when they are bequeathed a cottage in rural Ireland. But the run-down gaff comes with a catch. Local folklore dictates that the owners deliver a daily offering to the murderous goblins who live at the bottom of the garden. When Jamie is terrorised by macho local builder Daddy Whelan (Colm Meaney), Maya hits on a way to turn that catch to their advantage. The creature effects are decent, but there’s a straight-to-video feel about this underpowered comedy horror.
