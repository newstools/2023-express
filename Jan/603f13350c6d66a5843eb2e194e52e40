The UK didn’t perform well in the rankings, coming in a lowly 26th place, far behind many other European countries.

Sweden and Norway offer fathers far more paternity leave than the UK, explaining Norway’s place near the top of the table.

Singapore took second place on the list and its education system is commonly ranked among the best in the world. Although rents can be high, many expats are on relatively high salaries which can help to balance this out.
