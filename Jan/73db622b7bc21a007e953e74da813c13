If Quentin Tarantino hadn’t become one of Hollywood’s most iconic directors he admits he’d probably have been a film critic. Having made nine of his planned 10 movies, the 59-year-old has turned his hand to writing books. Following the novelisation of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, the filmmaker has also penned a book of essays called Cinema Speculation. And during his promotional tour, he confessed what he thinks are the seven perfect movies. According to Tarantino’s new book, there are “very few perfect movies” but wrote the 1974 slasher Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of them. Speaking previously with Jimmy Kimmel, the host asked him what the other perfect movies are. The director said: “Look, when you say perfect movies you’re talking about any individual person’s aesthetic but even trying to account for all aesthetics… perfect movies kind of crosses all aesthetics to one degree or another. It might not be your cup of tea but there’s nothing you can say to bring it down.” He then went on to name them. Tarantino said: “I think Jaws fits into that. I think The Exorcist fits into that. I think Annie Hall fits into that. Some people say, Young Frankenstein. I could say The Wild Bunch fits into that. And that’s not even a perfect movie. Its imperfections are part of its glory so let me take The Wild Bunch out. That’s kind of the point, though. Something that’s so unassailable. Back to the Future is a perfect movie!” The filmmaker has previously said which of these he believes is the greatest movie ever made.

Maybe not the greatest film. But it's the greatest movie ever made. And then there are other movies that can get in its rarefied air. But as far as a movie, there's no making it better than Jaws. There's no ‘better’ than Jaws. It is the best movie ever made.”
