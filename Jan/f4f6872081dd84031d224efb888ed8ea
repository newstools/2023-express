Philadelphia Eagles star K'Von Wallace is at risk of missing the Super Bowl after being involved in a brutal fight during the NFC Championship game. Eagles and San Francisco 49ers players rushed into the middle of the field as tempers flared with just minutes to play in Philadelphia. The Eagles walked over the 49ers in the NFC Championship game, though they were helped slightly with 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy suffering an elbow injury early on. They led the game 31-7 with just under four minutes remaining and the Super Bowl in their sights, as players no doubt started to imagine themselves playing in the biggest game in the world. After a play brought up fourth down for the 49ers, it appears their tempers got the better of them, as a scuffle broke out in the middle of the field, with players being pulled apart by referees. As officials tried to calm things down, Trent Williams of the 49ers lost his cool and picked up Wallace before throwing him backwards onto the turf. Wallace immediately got back up and swung a punch back at Williams, as a mass brawl broke out in the middle of the field. Players from both teams threw punches as officials struggled to contain the scuffle. Things eventually calmed down with both Williams and Wallace being ejected. The Eagles were able to walk away with the win, and will now turn their attentions towards the Super Bowl in Arizona. They will play against either the Kansas City Chiefs or Cincinnati Bengals. However, they will have to wait before learning whether Wallace can join them. He will likely face a fine by the NFL, and it is possible - though unlikely - he will receive a suspension.
