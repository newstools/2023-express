Haris Namani looked downcast as he returned to the UK after being the second contestant dumped from the series earlier this week. Haris Namani, 21, was seen in Heathrow airport this morning with fellow islander Anna-May Robey as they returned from South Africa. The pair were worlds away from their Love Island images as they opted for comfort over fashion for the long-haul flight. Shortly before Haris was dumped from the villa, a video emerged reportedly showing the Doncaster native in a “street brawl”. Haris made a statement in his exit video saying he was “devastated” that the clip had been released as it was not a true “reflection of my character”. The Sun has now reported that the islander could be facing a police investigation over the clip, according to a source.
