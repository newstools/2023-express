   Other Britons have also been writing into Express.couk daily to complain they no longer get the discount, despite the Government claiming more people should be getting it, not less. Angela is disabled and suffers from Reynauds Syndrome, ME and COPD and has mobility issues which mean she's often stuck at home.    The 65-year-old lives in Canterbury, Kent, and said she needs the Warm Home Discount now more than ever. She added: "When I first heard about people having their WHD stopped after years of getting it I thought it must be misinformation so I went on the government's website - and it was true!"  Pamela, a 69-year-old pensioner from Tyne and Wear said she was also shocked to find out she didn't qualify for the Warm Home Discount this year. She said the criteria doesn't take into account that some council properties are not as energy efficient as they should be.    She continued: "People who have received it in the past are no longer getting it, so how is that right?" Express.co.uk contacted the Government department responsible for the Warm Home Discount for a response and clarification on the changes.  It said three million households will receive the Warm Home Discount this year, compared to around 2.2 million in previous years. The discount is given to households on means-tested benefits who live in homes that BEIS has estimated as a "relatively high cost to heat".
