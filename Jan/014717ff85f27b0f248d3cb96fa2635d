The Kansas City Chiefs' preparations for the AFC Championship game were rocked by a late injury to Travis Kelce, with Chiefs officials set to evaluate him at game-time to decide whether he can play against the Cincinnati Bengals. The Chiefs were relying on Kelce to put up a big performance due to the condition of Patrick Mahomes. The quarterback suffered a high-ankle sprain last week, but is desperate to play against the Bengals. The ankle injury he suffered usually rules players out for approximately three weeks, and it is expected that Mahomes' movement will be limited if he does play. Now, however, the Chiefs will be further limited by news of Kelce's injury. The tight end, widely regarded as one of the best of all time in his position, apparently suffered a back injury during practice on Friday. Jay Glazer of Fox Sports explained: "Patrick Mahomes has a high ankle sprain, and he - on Saturday night after that game - started treatment, they've been very aggressive with his treatment the entire week long. "As the week progressed, he got better and better and better. They've said right now he has no limitations, the only thing is when he stops, he's gonna feel pain, but her's fine. "There is, however, a big question mark with the Chiefs right now, that's their tight end Travis Kelce. The very last play of practice on Friday he went up for a pass, his back locked up, and he had to get an anti-inflammatory on Friday, Saturday and this morning. They still don't know if he can go, it's going to be a game-time decision. "I just spoke to someone on the Chiefs, they said before making a decision, they need to see him run. They're holding their breath on him, a guy who doesn't miss any action."
