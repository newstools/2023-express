A young woman mauled to death by eight dogs she was walking has been named as Natasha Johnston. The 28-year-old woman was attacked by the pets she was hired to look after at a beauty spot in Caterham, Surrey on January 12. Both Surrey Police and the coroner had refused to identify Miss Johnston, but her name was listed on the Surrey Coroner's Court website this afternoon.Her inquest is expected to formally open tomorrow morning.Eight dogs were seized by police at the scene and continue to remain in police custody.None of the dogs were banned breeds and no prosecutions have been brought forward by Surrey Police, who confirmed last week they have now closed their investigation. Armed officers and the National Police Air Service (NPAS) were dispatched to Gravelly Hill by police after they received reports of a dog attacking people at 2.45pm.The attack reportedly took place after one dog bit another dog walker, before going after Miss Johnston.Miss Johnston was declared dead at the scene and another woman was rushed to hospital but has since been discharged, police said.An 11-stone Leonburger named Shiva is reported to have been one of the dogs taken into a police car.The dog had previously appeared on a BBC show about problematic puppies. Other dogs reportedly seized include two dachshunds, a cockapoo and a collie. It was reported at the time that the victim screamed out in desperation after a "frenzied" group of dogs fatally attacked her "like a pack of small wolves". She was found by two horse riders as she lay dying in the aftermath of the tragic attack. Speaking at the time, a resident said the incident had "left the community feeling anxious and, of course, heartbroken".
