Ozzy Osbourne's signature gothic look was nowhere to be seen as he posed with his wife Sharon in a throwback snap taken way back in 1987. The moment was captured just five years after he infamously bit the head off a bat on stage for his Diary of a Madman tour, but the stage persona could scarcely be seen in the snap, in which he and his wife wore pastel blue. Aside from his tattoos, nothing in the photo suggested the family man was the same person who'd enjoyed a legendary career as a Black Sabbath rocker. Sharon also looked extremely different from her early days as she looked worlds away from her signature redhead look. Ozzy, now 74, and Sharon, 70, also posed for a snap with their three kids, Jack, Kelly and Aimee, who are all grown up now. The entire family wore shades of baby blue and white - a far cry from the all black ensembles Ozzy had been rocking on stage - and there wasn't a trace of makeup to be seen on him, while Sharon sported a 1980s bouffant cropped hairstyle.
