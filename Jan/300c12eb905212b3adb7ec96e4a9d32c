Jennifer Lopez, 53, made sure all eyes were on her last night as she underwent a total of two outfit changes at the Hollywood premiere of her Prime Video film, Shotgun Wedding. JLo looked amazing at the premiere in a sheer nude dress which draped over her body and left little of her gym-honed physique to the imagination. Covered in sequins, Jennifer displayed the tanned bodysuit she wore under the show-stopping dress, as well as her petite waist being clinched by a bright yellow bow. She then underwent an outfit change before posing for pictures alongside her husband and beau Ben Affleck. The Jenny from the Block hitmaker sported a similar oversized sheer ruffled dress, paired with diamante leggings, exposing her toned pins. Ben was quick to show his wife his support as he kissed her head and chatted with the movie's co-stars at the after-hours premiere party.
