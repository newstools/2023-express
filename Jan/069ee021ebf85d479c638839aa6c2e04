The January transfer window is now over third of the way through and the majority of Premier League clubs are still hard at work behind the scenes to put their respective plans for the mid-season market into action. Just shy of £300million was spent by top-flight sides last January and it seems as though a similar outlay could be splashed on new players over the course of this month as managers up and down the country look to ramp up their preparations for the all-important run-in. Manchester United are in the market for a new striker and have reportedly made significant progress regarding a loan deal for Burnley striker Wout Weghorst, who has been spending the campaign with Besiktas but is set to join the Red Devils in the not-too-distant future. A compensation package is thought to have been agreed between United and the Turkish club and Weghorst is desperate to make the move happen, although Besiktas will need to find a replacement before the deal can be sanctioned by all parties involved. Chelsea, meanwhile, have already made a number of signings but are now believed to be chasing a move for PSV Eindhoven winger Noni Madueke, with advanced discussions said to be ongoing at club level. The likes of Arsenal, Newcastle and Leeds United will also be looking to strengthen their respective squads as a matter of priority, but it remains to be seen which Premier League club will manage to take the biggest strides over the course of this month.
