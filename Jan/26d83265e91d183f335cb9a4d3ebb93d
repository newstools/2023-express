Speed limits on residential roads across the UK could be restricted to 20mph as a default in the near future, in order to increase safety for road users. From September this year, Wales will become one of the first countries in the world to make 20mph default on all residential roads and built-up areas. Meanwhile, Scotland plans to make “appropriate” roads 20mph by 2025. But do you support the reduced speed limit becoming standard? Vote in our poll. Green MSP Mark Ruskell has campaigned for lower speed limits since 2019, arguing that the nation is at a “tipping point”. He told inews.co.uk that he believed most residential streets would be 20mph in a few years’ time. He said: “There will be exceptions that will be needed on urban roads that are more arterial in nature, for key bus routes into towns and cities, but 30mph will no longer be the default speed limit where people live, work and play. It has been the default for generations, and now it’s now.” READ MORE: Speed limits may be slashed as 'the whole UK will inevitably be 20mph' Many councils across the UK have already adopted 20mph speed limits around schools and in high-risk areas, with the stopping distance halved compared to 30mph. According to campaign group 20’s Plenty for Us some 26 million people in the UK now live in areas with 20mph policies. So what do YOU think? Should 20mph be the default speed on UK roads?
