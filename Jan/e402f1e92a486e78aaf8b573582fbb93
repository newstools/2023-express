The Sutton Trust charity, which polled 1,050 current undergraduates, is urging ministers to review student funding and support.  Founder and chairman, Sir Peter Lampl, said: “It is scandalous students are skipping meals and having to cut back on essentials.” The Department for Education said: “We are increasing loans and grants for living and other costs for a further year.  “To support universities to top up their own hardship funds we are also making an additional £15million available. “We urge any student who is worried to speak to their university.”
