Chelsea's shock hijack of Arsenal's bid to sign Mykhaylo Mudryk yesterday was one of the most sensational twists to a transfer saga for many years. While the Ukrainian will grab most of the headlines he is unlikely to be the only business done today with Manchester United, Leeds and Wolves among those all chasing further deals. Mudryk is reportedly expected to be at Stamford Bridge today as he closes in on an £88million move to west London after turning his back on his dream transfer to the Emirates. The Blues could be set for wholesale changes once he arrives too with 10 stars facing an uncertain future at the club Arsenal will now turn their attention elsewhere and Barcelona star Raphinha has already been linked by the Spanish press. With Mikel Arteta desperate to add to his attacking options this is a situation that could develop over the coming days. Meanwhile, United will also be hoping to complete more business while Leeds will be looking to bring in more after smashing their transfer record to sign Georginio Rutter yesterday.
