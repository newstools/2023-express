Nicola, 27, sported a red lip as she cosied up to designer Giuliano Calza before uploading a photo with Brooklyn, 23, who sported a lipstick print-covered cheek after being smothered in kisses. In the arty shot, Nicola looked incredible with the bold rouge lip while leaning tenderly towards GCDS fashion founder Giuliano. Brooklyn was in on the joke as he posed with Nicola for another lipstick-adorned snap. Giuliano also poked fun at Brooklyn, insisting they were aiming to "make Brooklyn gelly".(sic) It comes as the couple recently jetted off to Mexico with Selena Gomez and friends to ring in the New Year.
