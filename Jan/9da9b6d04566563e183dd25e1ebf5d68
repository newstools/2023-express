There are only eight days left of the January transfer window and there are likely still plenty of deals to be done among the Premier League big boys. Arsenal regained their five point lead at the top of the table on Sunday courtesy of a thrilling 3-2 victory over Manchester United. And Gunners boss Mikel Arteta will be desperate to add at least another new face or two to his ranks as the Spanish boss aims to build a squad capable of competing for a first title since 2004 until the bitter end. United, meanwhile, were given something of a reality check by the defeat, and Erik ten Hag may well point out to the board that he still requires further signings in addition to Jack Butland and Wout Weghorst if the Red Devils are to have a successful season. Tottenham, Liverpool, Newcastle and Chelsea could also still splash the cash in the coming weeks, and it will be intriguing to see if there are any more big surprise deals before the window slams shut on January 31.
