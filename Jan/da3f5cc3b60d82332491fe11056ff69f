Emma Raducanu will leave it until the very last minute before deciding whether she can compete at the Australian Open next week. The 2021 US Open champion suffered another injury setback last week at the ASB Classic in Auckland after retiring from her match against Viktoria Kuzmova. Raducanu left the court in tears after rolling her ankle during the second set just 11 days before the start of the Australian Open. The Briton had looked in good form early in the match, not dropping a single game in the opening set. She's now back on the court in Australia to prepare for the first major of the year, with the draw taking place on Thursday. Raducanu appeared to be in some discomfort during a hitting session on Monday. With such little time to get back to full fitness, Raducanu admits she still doesn't know whether she will be able to compete at the Australian Open. But the Briton added that she won't make a final decision until the tournament officially gets underway on Monday.

"I don’t know what I could have done to really prevent that. I am just taking it a day at a time and every single day just trying as best as possible to see and make progress. We’ll see.  "Hopefully by Monday or whenever the tournament starts I’ll be OK and ready. We’re just taking it a day at a time and not trying to expect too much at this point.” Raducanu's hitting session saw her take to the court without any significant strapping on her ankle. She reportedly only hit for around 30 minutes and there was no rigorous movements. But it was a slight indication that she's at least pushing to be fit in time for the start of the major.
