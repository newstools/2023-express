During one recent episode of Escape to the Chateau, the family showed viewers how they celebrated Christmas in France. The couple invited friends and family to party with them as they marked an end of an era. They also wanted to thank those who had helped them along the way. However, towards the end of the episode, things got too much for Arthur after he broke down in tears.
