In the tell-all interview, which featured clips of the royal’s audiobook, Harry outlined his hopes for his father and brother to read ‘Spare’.     He told ITV: “I don’t think my father or brother will read the book. “I really hope they do, but I don’t think they will. “And with regard to this interview, I don’t know whether they’ll be watching this or not, but what they have to say to me and what I have to say to them will be in private, and I hope it can stay that way.” Despite Harry making many accusations against the monarchy and his family, Prince William has remained silent.
