Chelsea winger Mykhaylo Mudryk has apologised in response to mass criticism for using a racial term in a viral TikTok video. The 22-year-old was filmed repeating the N-word last July in footage resurfacing after his Â£88.5million move to the Premier League. Last July, Mudryk shot a 40-second video alongside a friend and an Audi sports car, posting it on popular social media app TikTok. The pair rapped lines from Lil Baby's 2017 track, 'Freestyle', and repeated the N-word, which is mentioned 16 times throughout the song. Since deleted following backlash, the clip hit over 214,000 views and, for many, will have put a dampener on Mudryk's exciting Premier League arrival. The Ukraine international has issued an apology through The Sun via a spokesperson, stressing his regret about the 'inappropiate' video. A statement read: "Mykhaylo is deeply sorry for any offence caused by the video posted on his TikTok account last July.

Kick It Out, football's leading anti-racism group, has slammed Mudryk for his use of racial slurs in the video, 'irrespective of context'. "Kick It Out condemns the use of all racial slurs, including the N-word irrespective of context," a response read. "The N-word is deeply offensive, and the use of this term by high-profile figures in football can only serve to alienate people from the game.

Mudryk made his Chelsea debut in the 0-0 draw against Liverpool at Anfield on January 21, the Blues' last game. He is expected to play a significant role for Graham Potter in the second half of the season, with Chelsea vying to perform an unlikely but possible turnaround to finish in the Premier League top four.
