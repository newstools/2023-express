New destinations are on the radar for 34 percent, while a fifth see travelling abroad as a way of stepping out of their comfort zone. Exploration holidays are at the forefront of the mind for the over-55s, while 64 percent of those aged 25 to 34 are all about the beach. A spokesman for London Luton Airport, which commissioned the survey to identify the travel trends of 2023, said: “Last year saw a continued rise in demand for air travel, with over 13 million leisure and business passengers travelling through London Luton Airport.” More than half (51 percent) of the over-55s are keen to visit locations off the beaten track now they are fully able to travel again. Nearly two-thirds of this generation find multi-destination holidays the most appealing – while those aged 18 to 24 are keen to choose something with a bit more adventure. A voyage of self-discovery is the key agenda for 14 percent, while the younger generation – those aged 18-24 – admit they will be looking for love (15 percent). But with the cost-of-living crisis looming over us all, half of respondents (49 percent) have rethought their holiday plans for the year ahead, with 23 percent opting for cheaper destinations. More than four in ten of those polled, via OnePoll, will only be looking at offers and deals as a way of managing to pay for their vacation, while 28 percent plan on booking each holiday component separately to get the best price. It also emerged nearly a fifth (19 percent) are considering going away with family members, to keep the costs down. Thinking ahead, 27 percent already have a dedicated savings pot for next year’s holiday, while 22 percent typically do this more than a year in advance.
