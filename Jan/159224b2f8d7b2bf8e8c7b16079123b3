Nicole Scherzinger, 44, has extended her winter break beyond the New Year and is still on location in swelteringly warm Hawaii. As she lives it up with her partner, Scottish rugby ace Thom Evans, in the tropical paradise, Nicole has been posting updates for her 5.4 million Instagram followers. The Masked Singer US judge took off her baggy hoodie to reveal a toned and tanned physique in a multi-coloured bikini. The stunning beauty, who has Hawaiian ancestry herself, captioned her video: ""When the rest of the US is cold but youâ€™re grateful for that Hawaiian sun." Admiring fans declared her the "most beautiful woman in the world", while others took one look at her age-defying video and exclaimed: "Hotness level out of control!"
