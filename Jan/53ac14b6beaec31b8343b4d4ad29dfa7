Joe Biden is facing further embarrassment after a bundle of classified documents were found at his home in Delaware. The government files are the second batch to be recovered at a private address of Biden, 80. Confirming the discovery, Richard Sauber, Special Counsel to the President, said the files were in a "storage space" in Biden's garage.    It comes two months after 10 classified documents labelled 'Top Secret' were found locked in a closet at the Penn Biden Center think tank in Washington DC. Both of the retrieved bundles date back to Biden's time serving as Vice-President to Barack Obama, from 2009 to 2017. It has handed ammunition to Republicans eager to draw comparisons with the Department of Justice investigation into Donald Trump's handling of classified material. More than 325 classified files were discovered in 2021 at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida - and Biden labelled this "irresponsible".   In a press conference on Thursday after the news emerged, Biden was asked how he could leave classified documents "next to your corvette". He responded: "By the way, my corvette is in a locked garage, OK? So it's not like it's sitting out in the street." The President the confirmed the documents were in a locked garage "as well as my corvette". He added: "But as I said earlier this week, people know that I take classified documents and classified material seriously.  "I also said we're cooperating fully and completely with the Justice Department's review." Biden said his team "discovered a small number of documents with classified markings in storage areas and file cabinets in my home and my personal library." In a Twitter post after the news broke, Donald Trump Jr blasted: "I'm sure a lot of people keep Top Secrete and Classified documents in their... wait fo it... GARAGE... that's the best place to keep them because no one would think to look there. "Joe Biden is playing 7D Chess folks and you just can't keep up."
