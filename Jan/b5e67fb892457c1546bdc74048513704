Zack (played by James Farrar) had happily accepted that Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty) would soon be having his baby, and the pair were excited about the future. However, Zack's world crumbled recently on the BBC soap when he was informed by an old acquaintance, Brett Nelson (Fabrizio Santino) that he might have HIV as he used to share needles with Brett, who has since tested positive for the condition. Zack has been in denial since, refusing to get tested or to tell anyone, but he began to crumble in Wednesday's episode, causing some EastEnders fans to cry over the "heartbreaking" scenes. Zack was clearly feeling deeply troubled by the news but tried to continue as though nothing was wrong. However, he messed up an interview with Ravi Gulati (Aaron Thiara) and ended up telling Whitney he couldn't be a father. Brett tried to convince his old friend to get a test done, but Zack continued to bury his head in the sand. "Do I look sick to you?"

Do I look like I've got HIV? It ain't as simple as that mate and you know it." He then urged Zack to get tested for the sake of Whitney and the baby. After leaving Whitney in tears following their conversation, Zack locked himself in his office and smashed the place up. After realising he was bleeding after cutting his hand, Zack broke down, sobbing uncontrollably. Responding to the pain Zack was experiencing, many viewers found themselves in tears. DON'T MISS...
