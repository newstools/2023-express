The Nationality and Borders Act 2022, which comes into force today, will clamp down on offenders who claim to have been trafficked, making it harder to kick them out. The Home Secretary said: “It is totally unfair that genuine victims of modern slavery may be left waiting longer to receive the protections they need due to the flagrant abuse of the system. “The changes coming into force will mean if you’ve committed an offence, we have the power to refuse your protections and kick you out of our country.” Previously, if a foreign national – and criminal – said they were a victim of modern slavery, moves to remove them from Britain would be paused while their claim was considered by caseworkers. But now the Home Secretary can prevent certain foreign crooks – and people who have made false claims – from getting protection. She will be able to deny it to those who have committed a serious offence or been sentenced to more than 12 months, as well as those who pose a national security risk. The Home Office said guidance for caseworkers has been updated to make it clear that there should be “objective evidence” of modern slavery rather than “mere suspicion”. Evidence could include details of physical and psychological abuse or the circumstances in which a person was found by emergency services. Ms Braverman said: “We must stop people exploiting our immigration and asylum laws. I am determined to crack down on those abusing the generosity of the British public and taking our country for a ride.” The National Referral Mechanism (NRM) identifies and supports potential and confirmed adult victims of modern slavery. Referrals to the NRM soared by 450 percent between 2014 and 2021, with 12,727 made last year alone. The Home Office said more police officers have been trained to identify and probe modern slavery, boosting referrals and prosecutions.
