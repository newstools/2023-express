EastEnders' Stacey Slater (played by Lacey Turner) was horrified when she was informed by doctors that her 12-year-old daughter Lily Slater (Lilia Turner) was pregnant. The youngster refused to reveal the identity of her baby’s father at first before eventually revealing she’d slept with Ricky Jr Mitchell (Frankie Day) and swearing her mum to secrecy but was Lily telling the truth? In Wednesday’s instalment, Stacey searched the square for clues about her daughter’s relationships. Jean Slater (Gillian Wright) quizzed her daughter about boys in Lily’s life but Stacey could only come up with one. She recalled Lily going on a date with Nugget Gulati (Juhaim Rasul Choudhury) but quickly dismissed the idea he could be the father. Just as Stacey returned home she caught Lily looking out the window.

She asked Lily if Ricky Jr was the father and the schoolgirl confirmed he was. However, EastEnders aren’t so sure Lily was telling the truth and are convinced she’s protecting someone. @malteezas tweeted: “Still don’t think Ricky jr is the father of Lily’s baby, reckon she’s covering for someone! I still think it’s nugget or someone else #EastEnders.” @youxkay questioned: “Was it really Ricky Jr or did she just say yes to shut her mum up? #EastEnders.” “I wonder if Nugget is actually the father of Lilly's baby. I feel like Lilly just said it was Ricky Jnr because Stacey jumped to that conclusion. Ricky Jnr doesn’t seem the type for one night stands unless he was provoked. #EastEnders,” @RyanTheSoapking added. (sic) @i_jaysmith wrote: “Anyone else NOT convinced that Ricky Jr is in fact the father after that lacklustre confession from Lily? #EastEnders.” @SilentTheatre1 remarked: “Do we believe Lily when she said Ricky Jnr  is the dad #Eastenders she seemed to shake and nod her head.” DON'T MISSEastEnders fans think Lily Slater and Stacey Slater stars are related [INSIGHT]EastEnders fans 'work out' father of Lily Slater's baby in DNA twist [THEORY]EastEnders' Zack Hudson receives life-changing news [SPOILER] @JFDT29 suggested: “I don't think Ricky Jr is Lily's baby daddy... I think judging by Lily looking out of the window that it is Nugget #Eastenders.” Will Lily be proven to be a liar or will Stacey never get to the bottom of her daughter’s pregnancy? Stacey lost the trust of her daughter when she opened up to Jean but it seems she’s turned a corner with Lily. Social services and the police spoke to Lily at the hospital but they will likely want to carry out further interviews to make sure she’s safe. Lily doesn’t want her mum to tell Ricky Jr he’s the father of her baby and seems determined to keep her pregnancy a secret. The youngster begged her mum to keep Martin Fowler (James Bye), who raised Lily as his own, in the dark. If Lily is telling the truth, she may just want to protect her friend Ricky Jr from getting into trouble. However, could Lily be lying and protecting someone else in Walford? EastEnders airs on BBC One from Monday to Friday at 7.30pm.
