Bobbles on clothes are unfortunately commonplace whether it’s a jumper, a tracksuit or a coat - most winter clothes are prone to bobbling. Bobbles form when fibres in the fabric become loose and get knotted forming small balls or bobbles rather than falling off the fabric. The bobbles usually appear when clothes rub together in the wash or if the fabric is brushed against another surface like a handbag, for example. With this in mind, fans of cleaning sensation Mrs Hinch, whose full name is Sophie Hinchliffe, have shared their simple solution for preventing bobbling on clothes. The cleaning and lifestyle influencer has more than 4.6 million followers on Instagram and often shares her garden and home tips online. Fans of hers have taken to social media in recent years to share their own hacks for solving common household problems.
