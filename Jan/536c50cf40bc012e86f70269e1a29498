However, Democratic areas saw a slump, a study has revealed. Researchers say Trump’s presidency increased the economic optimism of Republicans, motivating them to have more children. Study co-author Professor Gordon Dahl, of the University of California, said: “The size is equivalent to changes in birth rates that occur after economic shocks or in response to policies designed to affect birth rates. “For example, when unemployment drops by one percent, it increases national fertility by one to two percent, and when other countries provide a $1,000 subsidy to mothers for having a child, fertility rates rise by about two percent.” Researchers said the 2016 victory provided the perfect natural experiment, due to the polarisation of the country and the shock of the result. The Civiqs survey team also looked at birth rates among Hispanic people. Prof Dahl said: “Hispanics were singled out by the Trump campaign and voted approximately two-to-one for Hillary Clinton in 2016.” The research team found Hispanic mothers had fewer babies after the election. For comparison, Barack Obama, who was long projected to win the presidency in both 2008 and 2012, had no effect on birth rates. Yet, they found a similar effect to Trump in 2000 when George W Bush was elected after Al Gore was favoured. Co-author Dr William Mullins said: “Our research illustrates how polarised the country has become in 20 years. “Democrats and Republicans are deeply divided on policy priorities and worries about the future, including on topics such as the environment, inequality, moral values and immigration. “Polling data reveals members of the two parties see the country through almost completely different lenses.” The study was published in the American Economic Review.
