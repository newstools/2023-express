Former Brexit Minister David Jones urged the PM to act, amid fears of a U-turn over plans to remove 4,000 pieces of EU legislation from UK statute books by December.  Mr Jones warned: “The authority of the Prime Minister rests upon this being completed. At stake, too, is the future of the Conservative Party.” Ministers have pledged to “sunset” Brussels laws by December this year via the Government’s Retained EU Law Bill, which is currently making its way through Parliament.  Suggestions of a climbdown have been denied by Number 10, but some Whitehall officials are pushing for the deadline to be extended to 2026. The Government is also expecting fierce opposition in the Lords, which begins debating the Bill next month.
