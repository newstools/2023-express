A mum has issued a warning to other parents after finding what appeared to be a spider stuck to ready-rolled pastry that had been purchased from Aldi. The woman, who does not wish to be named, told how her elderly father had bought the puff pastry from the budget supermarket on December 28.  She had asked for the pastry so she could make pasties for her one-year-old daughter. However, upon opening the £1.50 product, she claims she discovered a dead spider stuck to the side of the pastry. Had she not noticed the insect, the mum, from Canley, Coventry, said she would have fed it to her young daughter.     Speaking to Coventry Live, the mum said: "I thought to myself if I happened not to notice and did feed my daughter that... my daughter is only one year old, that is disgusting for a little child. "Obviously, a kid is not going to know, so what if I fed it to her and something else happened?" She has warned other parents to remain vigilant and said she was left feeling disappointed after her experience with the supermarket. The mum said: "Aldi is quite a big supermarket because of what is going on with the cost of living crisis so everybody shops there now. "If you are selling products with insects in them, people need to know. It is not right and it is not hygienic. "I am disappointed because it was for my daughter. "Other mothers need to be aware and be a bit wary of what they are feeding their children."  Aldi offered the woman a full refund of £1.50. A spokesman for Aldi said: "Our supplier has robust processes in place to prevent foreign objects from entering its products. "We have apologised to the customer that this product did not meet our usual high standards and have provided a full refund."
