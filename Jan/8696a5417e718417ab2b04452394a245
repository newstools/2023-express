NFL star Stefon Diggs apologised to a photographer after crashing into the onlooker during the third quarter of the Buffalo Bills' clash with the Cincinnati Bengals in the playoffs. The Bills were looking to reduce the deficit when quarterback Josh Allen targeted Diggs in the endzone only for the pass to fall incomplete. With just under 10 minutes remaining in the second quarter, the Bills were trailing the Bengals 17-7 after Joe Burrow threw two touchdowns in the first half amid falling snow. The conditions were clearly impacting some of the players throughout the early stages with several stars slipping. Diggs highlighted the remarkable conditions when he attempted to haul in what would have been a remarkable grab and potentially make it a three-point game. However, the 29-year-old slid across the icy turf and slammed into the wall out the back of the endzone. As he slid into the wall, Diggs took out an unknowing photographer who slammed into the ground in a heap. The three-time Pro Bowler motioned to return to the game beofre turning around to check on the photographer in a heart-warming display of affection.
