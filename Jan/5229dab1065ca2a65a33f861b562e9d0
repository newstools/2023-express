The images, featuring on the social media platform have led to many people wondering how a house with such potential could be "left to rot".

One room is full of what looks like props from a horror movie set including a coffin, stuffed figures and large heavy chains. Another area shows a horned animal skull and a dummy head among the items on a table.
