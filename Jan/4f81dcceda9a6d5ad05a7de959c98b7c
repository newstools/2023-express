Teddy, who wants to be a doctor, can already read and count in seven languages. His favourite books are Harry Potters, when his parents allow him to read them, and he does word searches and sums to relax. The child prodigy, now four, gained entry to the intellectual elite club aged three years and nine months. He counts to 100 in languages including Welsh, Mandarin, French, Spanish and German. Proud parents Beth, 31, and Will, 41, say they are shocked at his academic prowess.  Beth, of Portishead, Somerset, said: “When we had him assessed, that was so we could help him when he starts school in September.” Teddy, short for Theodore, scored 139 out of 160 on the Stanford Binet IQ test. He and sister Pippa were born by IVF and Beth quipped: “My husband and I are not linguists so we joke that the embryologist must have slipped a needle or something. He has ideas he wants to be a doctor. Him and his friend like to play doctors at nursery.”
