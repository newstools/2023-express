Jamie Lee Curtis, 64, looked younger than ever as she posed in a plunging cut-out gown while sharing some life advice. The Hollywood star wore a sleek black gown that featured carefully placed mesh inserts and an elegant silhouette. The gown left her ample assets on full display as well as exposing her gym-honed figure. She accessorised with an array of chunky silver bangles as she posed at the Getty Villa Museum in Los Angeles. Jamie was asked by British Vogue what advice she would give to her younger self, replying: "The same advice I give young people who want to do what I get to do: It’s so f******g fast – you will be shocked at how fast it all is. Try to be in the present moment." The February issue of British Vogue is available on newsstands and via digital download from Tuesday 24th January.
