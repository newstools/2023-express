The Pensions Act of 2014 meant the increase of state pension age to 67 has been brought forward by eight years. It is now set to rise to 67 between 2026 and 2028 for Britons, who may change their retirement plans as a result. A new review is now considering whether the increase to 68 should be brought forward to 2037 to 2039, instead of 2044 to 2046. However, experts are even speculating the rise to 68 could be brought forward even further. Steven Cameron, pensions director at Aegon, said: “As well as uncertainty over future increases to the state pension, we’ll hear more in the new year on the future age at which people can draw their state pension. “There is speculation this could go up to age 68 earlier than planned, possibly from the early to mid 2030s.” READ MORE: 10 key dates to look out for in 2023 for your money Understandably, such a change if enacted could mean a widespread shift in retirement plans. The decision has not yet been made, the DWP has stressed, with feedback needing to be published by May 7, 2023 in accordance with the law. Mr Cameron stressed the state pension is a “significant part of most people’s retirement income”. As a result, many will view what they get from the state pension as essential to their finances in later life.

The tool can help Britons check: There is no longer a forced retirement age of 65, and Britons can choose to keep working after they reach state pension age. However, people should also be aware the way the state pension rises has changed. Now, rather the a person reaching state pension age on a specific date like previous increases, people born between April 6, 1960 and March 5, 1961 will reach state pension age when they turn 66 years and a specified number of months.

It is not yet clear whether the state pension age will continue to rise past 68, once it eventually reaches this point. Any increases are likely to be met with some resistance, but could be necessary according to experts. Tom Selby, head of retirement policy at AJ Bell, weighed in on the matter, and added: “Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his chancellor risk being caught between the devil and the deep blue sea when it comes to state pension age increases. “A dramatic acceleration of existing plans would risk electoral oblivion, while pushing back planned rises could cost the Exchequer tens of billions of pounds.”
