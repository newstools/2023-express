The Russian star – who has taught Olympic rower James Cracknell and NFL star Jason Bell how to dance – has now turned pupil, taking advice from 2021 winner Rose Ayling-Ellis. Taking time out from the Strictly tour, Luba said: “It was a dream for many, many years to act, and this September I just went for it. “It has become one of my biggest loves.” The dancer revealed she has acting classes twice a week, and is also close friends with former EastEnders actor Rose, who gives her tips and tricks when they meet up socially. “Acting is one of my biggest hobbies,” said Luba, “which I would love to keep for a very long time. I’m working on it now and I will see where it all will go.” Asked which actress she would like to emulate, she replied: “There are plenty of actresses I admire, like Angelina Jolie. But Jodie Comer, too, is incredible. I went to see her play Prima Facie and I was blown away. “Hopefully, one day I’ll be able to do something like that, but I’m working on it.” Luba is currently on the Strictly tour which stars the best dancers of the last series, including winner Hamza Yassin and Helen Skelton. Helen has already had one win, but Luba said “winning” is not so important. “I don’t see that,” she said. “It’s a fun show for people who are big fans. It’s mostly for them. It’s not about the winning.” And she continued: “I think Strictly distracts people from any sort of problems in the world or in their lives. “We’re trying to bring joy for those two hours of the show. We hope we can make them forget about their troubles.” The four-times Italian dance champion, who joined Strictly in 2018, said she was quickly able to identify the celebrities with potential. She said: “I know in two minutes if someone’s going to be good!” Rowing legend Cracknell, whose average score was 12, was a challenge. “I’m a girl who loves her challenges! I still had a great time and he still loved the show. He was very happy about what he achieved because it’s very personal.”
