Their letter read: “The NHS is broken. Patients are dying and staff are suffering moral injury from the appalling conditions. We are desperately in need of meaningful action from our leaders and this cannot wait. “We therefore call on the government to immediately recall members of parliament from their Christmas recess to the House of Commons to hold an emergency debate on the state of the NHS.” During his first speech of the year, Mr Sunak acknowledged that there were “challenges” in the health service but said the Government was taking “urgent action” to help tackle demand including increasing NHS funding. The British Medical Association has accused the Government's “political choices” of leading to patients “dying unnecessarily”. So what do YOU think?
