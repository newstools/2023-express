London Mayor Sadiq Khan has slammed the Government’s “denial” of the “immense damage” Brexit is causing Britain. During a government dinner at Mansion House on Thursday the Labour mayor argued the nation should shift from the current “unnecessarily hardline version” of Brexit and move towards greater alignment with Europe. But do you agree? Vote in our poll. Mr Khan told City leaders: “I simply can't keep quiet about the immense damage Brexit is doing. Ministers seem to have developed selective amnesia when it comes to one of the root causes of our problems. Brexit can't be airbrushed out of history or the consequences wished away.” He also argued that Brexit has negatively affected the economy, with a reduction of GDP by 5.5 percent, but that issues must be addressed before it is too late.

It's weakened our economy, fractured our union and diminished our reputation. But, crucially, not beyond repair. “We need greater alignment with our European neighbours - a shift from this extreme, hard Brexit we have now to a workable version that serves our economy and people. That includes having a pragmatic debate about the benefits of being a part of the customs union and the single market.” In response, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s official spokesman said: “The British people set out their view back in 2016 and the government is busy enacting.” So what do YOU think?
