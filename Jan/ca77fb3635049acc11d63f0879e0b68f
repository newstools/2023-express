  Amanda looked trendy as she donned a long, camel coat, which she wore over a beige, patterned blouse and matching ascot. The star also wore a pair of cream coloured trousers and completed the look with some beige, pointed high heels. The ITV judge accessorised with a matching camel coloured handbag and some large, dark sunglasses. Reports have recently surfaced that Amanda and her co-judge Alesha Dixon are refusing to sign contracts for the latest series of Britain's Got Talent.  The pair are said to be fuming now that Bruno Tonioli, who is apparently replacing David Walliams, will be employed on a salary matching their own at an estimated £850,000. According to the Sun, show bosses have been left scrambling to get things in order after contract negotiations were thrown into chaos ahead of filming beginning next week. A source told the publication: “Amanda has been on BGT for 17 years, while Alesha is going into her eleventh year. “They don't think it's fair a newcomer could walk into the show and be handed the same deal as them.  “It's a bit of a headache for BGT given filming for the next series begins at the London Palladium on Tuesday. “Bruno was still ironing out his contract on Friday too so it's all very much down to the wire.” Express.co.uk have contacted reps for Amanda and Alesha for comment. A representative for Britain’s Got Talent declined to comment.
