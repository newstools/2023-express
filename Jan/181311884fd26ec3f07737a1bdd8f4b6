Rita Ora, 32, showed off her risqu√© sense of fashion as she went braless in a sheer lace dress for the pre-Golden Globes Party in West Hollywood. Her purple see-through dress exposed her underwear as she sported a small pair of black knickers, accentuating her gym-honed figure. Adding height to her outfit, Rita wore black stiletto heels, while styling her blonde tresses in a tight bun. She left strands out at the front to frame her face as she smiled for the camera, with the hit pop singer going for a flawless makeup palette. The Masked Singer UK panellist went for light pink lipstick paired with dark blue eyeshadow, not distracting onlookers from her statement dress.
