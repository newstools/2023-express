Damar Hamlin has shared his first image from hospital just days after suffering a cardiac arrest on the field. On Monday night, Hamlin went down and needed CPR and a defibrillator after losing his pulse before being transferred to hospital for further medical procedures to save his life. Hamlin was then on a breathing tube and unconscious, before waking up on Thursday and communicating with his teammates the following day. And now he has shared his first picture, watching the Bills game with his family. The Bills are back on the field for the first time on Sunday when they face the New England Patriots, just days after emotionally witnessing their teammate fight for his life on the field. Thankfully, Hamlin looks to be in good spirits, with University of Cincinnati doctors stating that he has made a 'remarkable recovery', in the hopes that he will return home shortly, and potentially return to the NFL in the future. The Bills took an early lead in the game over the New England Patriots, with Nyheim Hines returning a punt for 96 yards for a touchdown, to which Hamlin reacted on Twiter. He wrote: "OMFG!!!!". Hamlin went into cardiac arrest in during the Bills' clash with the Cincinnati Bengals on Monday Night Football after he tackled receiver Tee Higgins and he needed to be revived on the field. After 30 minutes, he was transferred to the local hospital before undergoing more procedures, and begun to recover days later. On Thursday, physicians at UCMC revealed Hamlin awoke that morning while he spoke to his family, care team and Buffalo teammates on FaceTime on Friday. Hamlin will watch the Bills game from his hospital bed, with doctors hoping to get him sent home as soon as they can, with him now able to breathe without the use of a tube. The Bills cannot secure the number one seed, after the Kansas City Cheifs did so on Saturday night, but will look to get the two seed.
