He said: “What’s fascinating to see is the huge wage growth in so many areas, and how it isn’t just tied to one area with locations across Britain making their way into the top ten. "This wage growth is also seen outside of financial hubs and major cities, which may make people question whether the inner city pressure is worth it.” Such an impressive wage growth outside cities like London and Manchester could be down to more people working remotely or adopting a hybrid working week.
