Police are hunting two suspects after a teenager was stabbed to death in a "machete attack" in a town centre. Suffolk Police were called to Westgate Street in Ipswich after the terrifying incident in broad daylight happened around 3.35pm on Tuesday. Armed officers and a helicopter from the National Police Air Service led the search for the two male suspects allegedly involved in the assault who fled the scene. One suspect headed towards Providence Street and the other suspect was seen to be heading towards the Cornhill.  The Mail Online reported witnesses had been 'shaking in fear' after the attack and that social media comments had mentioned a 'sword like machete' being used. A section of Westgate Street remains closed off around the crime scene. A Section 60 Authority giving officers extra powers to stop and search began at 4.59pm for a period of 24 hours. Detective Chief Inspector Matthew Connick said: "This was a brazen attack in the town centre which will have caused great distress to anyone who witnessed it. "Whilst inquiries are at an early stage, we believe this to be a targeted attack. "There will be an increased police presence in Ipswich this evening and over the coming days to provide reassurance to local residents and businesses. We know that many people would have witnessed this attack and we urge you to make contact with us."
