While we hugely respect and value all of our public sector workers, who do an amazing job looking after us when we’re sick and educating our children, repeated strike action is not the answer when we’re all under pressure from high inflation and a rising cost of living. We have already brought in sensible new laws to introduce a minimum level of service for important parts of the UK’s infrastructure that we depend on every day – ambulances, trains and fire & rescue - ensuring they cannot completely shut down when workers strike and pose a severe risk to life. And our door to the unions remains open, as we want constructive conversations to continue on what we can afford as a country. But we also want to protect hardworking business owners – the shopkeepers, hairdressers, and landlords – whose sales are being hit by waves of disruption. It’s estimated that pubs, bars, restaurants, and hotels have lost more than £2 billion in trade thanks to industrial action – that’s roughly equivalent to losing out on sales of 400 million pints. So today, I call on all you Sunday Express readers to do your bit in helping your local businesses weather the storm. Whether it’s grabbing a coffee from your local café or doing your weekly shop at the market, we must do our best to carry on as normal. If the past few years have taught us anything, it’s that Britain is resilient in the face of adversity. Together we will keep Britain moving.
