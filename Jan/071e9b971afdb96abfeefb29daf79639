A British tourist was gunned down while holidaying at a luxury villa in Jamaica last Saturday. Personal trainer Sean Patterson, 33, from West London, was shot multiple times during his stay at the One Love Guest House in Bogue Hill, St James. Jamaican police told the PA news agency that officers from the Montego Bay Police received reports of “loud explosions” at the resort. Mr Patterson was standing by the accommodation’s on-site pool at the time. He was then shot multiple times following a short chase. The personal trainer was taken to hospital, his gunshot wounds located on his upper body and head, but could not be revived. A 34-year-old man from Kingston, Jamaica has been taken into custody in connection with the incident, local media have reported. It has also been reported that the man was deported from the UK in 2013. A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) spokesperson confirmed to PA they were currently “supporting the family of a British man who died in Jamaica and are in contact with the local authorities”. Mr Patterson is understood to have been in the country since December 29. He is the first person to have been murdered in the St James parish this year - with the area experiencing 198 murders in total in 2022. Jamaica as a whole reported 1,421 killings at the start of December - an increase on the 1,375 killings in the same period the year previous, a spokesman for Jamaica’s Constabulary Force told the Associated Press. A widespread state of emergency was called by the prime minister last month in response to a surge in gang violence on the island. This applied to specific communities in the capital of Kingston, along with six of the country’s 14 parishes, including popular tourist spots such as Montego Bay. Meanwhile last October Jamaica’s broadcasting regulator moved to ban music and TV broadcasts that might glorify or promote criminal activity. This included violence, drug use, scamming and weapons.
