Amanda Holden, 51, looked stunning on Friday as she made an entrance at the Britain's Got Talent auditions at the London Palladium. The presenter looked sensational in a thigh-skimming mini dress and she elevated her height with a pair of huge platform heels. Alesha Dixon also donned an eye-catching leather ensemble that consisted of a collared wrap dress paired with knee-high boots. Also joining the duo at the 2023 auditions were fellow judges Simon Cowell and Bruno Tonioli, along with hosts Ant and Dec. Former Strictly Come Dancing judge Bruno was released as David Walliams' replacement earlier this month.
