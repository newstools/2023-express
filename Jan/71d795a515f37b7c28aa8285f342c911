San Francisco 49ers star James Garoppolo was accused of mocking his own team-mates after being spotted on camera laughing as his team were losing. The 49ers endured a torrid time against the Philadelphia Eagles as quarterbacks Brock Purdy and Josh Johnson both suffered injuries. The 49ers went into the game with Purdy as their starter, as they have since the middle of the season due to injuries suffered by starter Trey Lance and backup Garoppolo. But during the opening quarter, Purdy was hit while attempting to throw a pass and suffered an injury to his elbow. He was forced off the field and after medical examinations, it looked unlikely he was going to be able to come back onto the field. That all changed, however, when his replacement, Johnson, was hit after throwing a pass and suffered an injury himself. He was taken off the field immediately and was unable to return. After Johnson's injury, it appeared the 49ers could be forced to put running back Christian McCaffrey in at quarterback, leaving fans looking column at watch parties throughout San Francisco. But despite watching his team fall apart before his eyes, Garoppolo didn't seem too fussed. One screenshot quickly went viral on social media appearing to show the ex-New England Patriot laughing with Lance. Fans fumed on social media, with one writing: "So now Jimmy G and Trey Lance are laughing. You have got to be kidding." Another posted: "Jimmy g and trey lance laughing while their team is down in a championship game is not a good look." Garoppolo is unlikely to return to the 49ers next season, with Purdy set to be named as starter for the 2023 campaign after his incredible impact this season. Purdy, nicknamed 'Mr Irrelevant' after being picked last in the NFL draft, has looked immense since starting for the 49ers, and it's been reported he'll be starting even once Lance comes back.
