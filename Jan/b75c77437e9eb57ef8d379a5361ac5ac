Austin Butler, 31, reunited with Elvis director Baz Luhrmann on the red carpet last night at the Critics Choice Awards, just days after the shock death of Lisa Marie Presley. The Hollywood actor went for an all-black ensemble consisting of an unbuttoned shirt and a black suit coat, paired with a thin gold necklace. He completed his look with matching black pants and shiny black dress shoes for the annual event. His appearance comes less than a week after the Golden Globes where Austin won Best Actor for his portrayal of Elvis in the biopic, crediting Lisa and her mother Priscilla Presley for their acceptance. Lisa died after reportedly suffering a cardiac arrest in her Calabasas home on Thursday aged just 54 years old.
