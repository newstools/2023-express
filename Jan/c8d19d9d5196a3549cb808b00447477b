"I will always be very proud of my association with the BBC and Radio 2 in particular and I'd like to thank everyone who has helped to make the mid-morning show a success." BBC Radio 2 has said it will announce the host and details of the new mid-morning show at a later date. Ken Bruce returns to BBC Radio 2 tomorrow with Craig Revel Horwood at 9.30am.
