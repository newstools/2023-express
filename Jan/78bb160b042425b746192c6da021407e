The lifestyle brand is known for quirky products including an infamous candle scented like intimate body parts and an insertable jade egg that controversially claimed to improve women’s health. But Goop closed its Notting Hill shop in 2021 after high street sales suffered during the pandemic. Gwyneth, 50, has now signed forms to have Goop Inc Ltd – the firm which ­handled cash from the UK arm – dissolved and struck off the register at Companies House, according to the Daily Mirror. The west London store opened as a ­temporary pop-up in 2018 before becoming an indefinite fixture. The most recent accounts were said to show it had losses of £1.4million. However, the wellness empire is still worth an estimated £200million worldwide.  The Shakespeare in Love actress told the Financial Times in September that Goop had not suffered too much during the ­pandemic as most sales are online. She said: “Ecommerce was really, really strong. But we lost our entire retail business for that year and we lost our brand partnerships business for a good six months.” The actress launched Goop from her kitchen in 2008 and has built the brand around beauty, wellness and sex products that aim to empower women. But she has faced criticism for some of her brand’s health claims, including advertising for jade and rose quartz eggs which were said to balance hormones and regulate menstrual cycles when used internally. Goop was fined £112,000 in 2018 over the “unsubstantiated” marketing boasts. Gwyneth shares two children, Apple and Moses, with her former husband, Coldplay singer Chris Martin.
