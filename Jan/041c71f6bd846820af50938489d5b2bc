Suffolk Police have released images of a man who is alleged to have stolen £60 from a four-year-old boy. The young boy accidentally dropped the money while at Smyths Toys at Anglia Retail Park, Bury Road, Ipswich on December 27. CCTV then captures a man picking up the cash and leaving the shop without handing the money in. Suffolk Police have released the footage and say they want to speak with the man in connection with the incident. The man is seen wearing a black hat, black jacket, scarf and light-coloured trousers. Mother of the four-year-old boy, Demelza Wilson, said her son Dougie received the £60 as a Christmas present and was going to use the cash to buy a new toy, as per the Ipswich Star.
