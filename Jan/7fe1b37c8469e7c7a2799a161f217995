Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson has signed a deal to write a book about his premiership. The memoir has no title or publication date but has been described as a “prime ministerial memoir like no other”. So are you interested in Mr Johnson’s memoir? Vote in our poll. The book, to be published by HarperCollins, is expected to explore Mr Johnson’s appointment as Foreign Secretary in 2016, the start of his premiership recounting his 2019 election landslide, the Brexit deal, the Government response to the pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It will also give insight into Mr Johnson’s downfall, the scandals he faced and his resignation. Arabella Pike, publishing director at William Collins, an imprint of HarperCollins UK described the book as “a prime ministerial memoir like no other” and said: “I look forward to working with Boris Johnson as he writes his account of his time in office during some of the most momentous events the United Kingdom has seen in recent times.” READ MORE: Boris to unleash bombshells in new book of his time at Number 10 HarperCollins did not share how much Mr Johnson was paid but industry insiders told The Guardian last year that he could expect “a high six-figure or even a seven-figure deal”. A close MP ally told The Telegraph on Monday: “Boris Johnson lives inside lots of people's heads rent-free so writing a book will be a good opportunity to put his version of events on the table for the record.” So how about YOU?
