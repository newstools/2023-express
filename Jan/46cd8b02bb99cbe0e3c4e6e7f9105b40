The star shared several shots on her Instagram feed of a shoot that took place in her mansion before stepping out to celebrate her friend Lori Harveyâ€™s 26th birthday. The first photo in the bunch showed the model laying back on her bed in a sheer one-shoulder gown that hugged her curves. She had a fabric choker around her neck with a flower detail on it. Her hair was in a messy updo and her makeup was subtle.
