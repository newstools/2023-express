Brits are facing "hazardous" ice in parts of the UK with a series of weather warnings issued. The Met Office has issued a yellow warning for ice covering a swathe of Scotland which comes into force at 6pm and runs until 11am tomorrow. It comes as Britain has been hit by a wet and windy New Year weekend. The warning states: "Rain, sleet and snow is expected to ease during Sunday leaving surfaces wet and with a cold night to come this is likely to lead to icy stretches forming widely on untreated surfaces across Scotland. "In addition some further sleet/snow showers are possible overnight for parts of the west and south though ice remains the main hazard." A further yellow warning of ice which affects much of northern England, south west Scotland and Northern Ireland kicks in at midnight until 11am on Monday. The warning states: "Following recent wet conditions surfaces are likely to remain wet into Monday morning and with a cold night icy stretches will readily form on untreated surfaces. "A few rain, sleet and snow showers may still affect these areas overnight but ice remains the main hazard." It comes on top of a yellow warning for snow covering a chunk of Scotland which runs until midday today. A further yellow warning for ice in Scotland expires at 11am. It comes as the UK has faced wet and windy conditions this weekend as a strong jet stream pushes a succession of low-pressure systems across the Atlantic Forecasters said the deadly bomb cyclone that sent temperatures plunging in the US over Christmas is causing the unsettled weather this side of the pond. Looking ahead to next week, a southeast and northwest split is expected to develop with high pressure in the south and low pressure to the north. The split is likely to see calmer weather further south and more unsettled conditions in the north. Monday is forecast to be fine, dry and bright for much of the country after a chilly start. However it will be showery in parts of northern and western Scotland.
