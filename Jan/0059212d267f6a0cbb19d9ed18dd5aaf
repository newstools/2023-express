The Prince must now pick up the phone to his father, build bridges and get things back on track in time for the King's coronation. It may be that healing divisions between Harry and the Prince of Wales will be the biggest challenge, but it is clear that there is nothing the King would love to see more. The Duke of Sussex has made many claims in his various television appearances and forthcoming book. One that has the ring of truth is the suggestion that Charles urged him and William to stop fighting, pleading with them not to "make my final years a misery". While this was phrased as an appeal to make their dear father happy, many parents who read this account will immediately understand that the King's real concern was the happiness of his children. Their lives will be infinitely better if they can count on each other to provide support and brotherly love. The Duke of Sussex's recent behaviour has shocked many. But he is a man who has served in the armed forces, worked hard to support ex-service personnel and campaigned on important issues such as mental health. He has a huge amount to offer. In one of his recent interviews, Harry said he wants to "get my father back... to have my brother back". It's not too late to do so.  Rishi Sunak is right - it is time to be grown ups and bring an end to the strikes crippling Britain, not least those affecting the NHS. His government has reached out to union leaders and invited them to talks designed to balance fair pay awards for public sector workers with what the taxpayer can afford. Ministers will be directly involved, rather than leaving negotiations to managers such as those in the health service. Unions must be equally committed to pulling out all the stops, compromising when needs be, and ensuring industrial action comes to a swift conclusion.
