    Robert Galloway hasn't received the Warm Home Discount of Â£150 this year, despite getting it for the last five years. He suffers from Multiple Scerosis (MS), a condition affecting the brain and spinal cord that gets much worse when it's cold. Mr Galloway told Express.co.uk: "It doesn't make sense, the house is still very cold and I was depending on the money as I do every other year. "I was very upset and disappointed when I found out that I was not getting the payment. I had to ring my energy company to find out if I was because I had not heard anything from them."   In order to qualify for the discount, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said people need to be on certain means-tested benefits or tax credits. The claimant's energy supplier also needs to be part of the scheme and - for the first time this year - the property has a "high energy cost score" based on its characteristics. People can check if they are eligible for a discount by using the eligibility checker on the GOV.UK website.  Express.co.uk contacted the Government department responsible for the Warm Home Discount for a response and clarification on the changes. BEIS declined to comment further. It said three million households will receive the Warm Home Discount this year, compared to around 2.2 million in previous years. The discount is given to households on means-tested benefits who live in homes the BEIS has estimated as a "relatively high cost to heat". The BEIS uses data on the type, size and age of the property, taken from the Valuation Office Agency, to estimate whether a property is high cost to heat. Further details of this are set out here.
