This year's Australian Open is quickly nearing its conclusion, with just a few matches left to play to crown the winners in Melbourne over the course of this weekend. Novak Djokovic will face Stefanos Tsitsipas in tomorrow's men's singles final but it will be the turn of the women on Saturday, with Elena Rybakina going up against Aryna Sabalenka in the battle for Grand Slam glory. Rybakina will be playing in her second major final in six months after winning Wimbledon last year and will be hoping to emerge victorious against fifth seed Sabalenk in a final set to be dominated by powerful hitting. The former managed to beat the likes of Iga Swiatek and Victoria Azarenka to reach this stage of the competition and will be desperate to maintain her winning form in order to secure her second Grand Slam title in her last three tournaments. There is also still plenty of off-court drama in Melbourne, with Djokovic's family having been warned by Australian Open director Craig Tiley after his father, Srdjan, was spotted mixing with pro-Russia protesters earlier this week. The Serb has already jumped to the defence of his father by insisting that he would never knowingly support the Russian regime, saying: "It's unfortunate the misinterpretation of what happened escalated. "There was a lot of Serbian flags around. That's what he thought. He thought he was making a photo with somebody from Serbia. That's it. He moved on." Follow Express Sport's live updates below.
