With just under two weeks of the January transfer window to go, pressure is starting to build on the Premier League big guns as the second half of the season beckons. Manchester United, Arsenal and Newcastle, among others, still have business they would like to conduct but selling clubs may grow reluctant to part with their star players the longer the window goes on. The Red Devils have already taken care of their main priority by bringing in Wout Weghorst to compensate for Cristiano Ronaldo's departure. There are still suggestions that manager Erik ten Hag would be keen on a new right-back, however, despite Aaron Wan-Bissaka's promising recent form. Arsenal are scrambling to put together a back-up plan after missing out on Mykhaylo Mudryk, who has joined Chelsea in an initial £62million deal. Outgoings may also be on the cards at the Emirates as boss Mikel Arteta looks to assemble a harmonious squad capable of pushing for Premier League glory. With Newcastle, Leeds and Chelsea also among those working hard behind the scenes to make squad improvements, follow Express Sport's live transfer updates below...
