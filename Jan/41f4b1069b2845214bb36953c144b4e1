This week, you will be able to lay your eyes upon the first Full Moon of 2023. On Friday, January 6, the Wolf Moon will rise over the United Kingdom in all its glory, reaching peak illumination at 11.07pm. According to timeanddate, the moon is named after howling wolves, which are active at this time of the year. However, it is often called the Moon After Yule in the Anglo-Saxon tradition. Ancient cultures from around the globe named moons based on the behaviour of plants, animals, or weather during that month. Other names for the January Full Moon include Stay Home Moon and Quiet Moon. The Full Moon is the lunar phase when the moon appears fully illuminated from Earth's perspective. They occur every 29.5 days, the length of time it takes for the Moon to orbit the Earth and complete one lunar phase cycle. When more than 98 per cent of the Moon's disc is illuminated, the Moon can appear to be full a day before or after. There will be 13 Full Moons this year, with two falling in August. This occurs every 2.8 years and we get a Blue Moon - the name was first penned in the March 1946 issue of Sky & Telescope magazine. The Wolf Moon will be followed by the Snow Moon on February 5 and the Worm Moon on March 7.
