The Kennel Club, which runs the dog show Crufts, has today revealed the finalists for its young person of the year award. This includes an 11-year-old from the West Midlands who turned to dog training with her Cavachon Woody in a bid to overcome her anxiety and low confidence.  A 16-year-old diagnosed with a vascular malformation tumour, for which she is still undergoing treatment, has also been recognised for her fundraising efforts. Vanessa McAlpine, Kennel Club events and youth development executive said: “We are so proud of our five young finalists, who demonstrate a level of determination, commitment and passion that exemplifies the ethos of the Young Kennel Club. “It is always such a difficult task to select just five from the many inspirational entries that we receive each year, but everyone who received a nomination should be so proud of their achievements. “Our members are such a credit to themselves, their dogs and their families.” The finalists in each category have been invited to Crufts 2023 on March 12 for a special presentation ceremony. As well as being crowned the Young Kennel Club Young Person of the Year, there is a prize fund of up to £750 which will be used towards helping the winner progress their love of dogs. Ms McAlpine said: “We are looking forward to welcoming our finalists to Crufts and seeing who the public have chosen as the winner of the Young Kennel Club Young Person of the Year award in March.” Previous winners of the yearly competition have been selected for their volunteering and fundraising for dog charities, helping to organise dog activities in the local community and for helping others with training or mentoring.
