An aspiring rapper was murdered "in an ambush" just yards from his London home, his family have said. Fernando Johnson was found seriously injured by police at around 2.15am today and died at the scene.   The 23-year-old was getting out of his BMW when he was ambushed by two men on Rosebank Way in Acton, London, his family told the Evening Standard. The road remains cordoned off along with several others in the area, with police officers at the scene, close to the A40 dual carriageway, reports My London. A large blue police tent has been erected over BMW 4x4 at the scene of the crime. A cousin of the victim told the Standard that Fernando, whose rapper name was Fdot, was a "lovely person who will be sadly missed". "This isn’t gang-related, as far as we know," they added.   Fernando's killers remain on the loose and a post mortem will be carried out shortly to determine whether he was shot or stabbed.
