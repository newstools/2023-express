On Saturday night's The Masked Singer, five characters took to the stage in their weird and wacky costumes in a bid to fool the judges. Each week, the star-studded panel and viewers at home try to guess which celebrities are hidden behind the mask. But, who will be unveiled tonight? However, as Joel Dommett introduced the judges, fans became distracted by Davina's glittery pink jumpsuit. The former Big Brother host even addressed how "tight" her choice of outfit was. Joel complimented: "Davina, you look like Charlie's Angels." "She is giving us fever, honey," Rita chipped in. "Fever!"

"Oh, hello," the host said as he posed with Davina in a Charlie's Angels pose. Davina proceeded to place her leg on the judging desk to show off her sparkly shoes. "Nice shoes," Jonathan praised as Rita added: "I love it."  Although, Davina struggled to get her leg off the desk, telling her co-stars: "Hang on." "Get it down," Joel said as the judge admitted: "It is very tight this outfit."
