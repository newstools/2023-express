Damar Hamlin is heading home days after being discharged from the University of Cincinnati Hospital. Hamlin has been under medical supervision since suffering a cardiac arrest on the field during the Buffalo Bills' game against the Cincinnati Bengals. In a statement, Jamie Nadler MD, critical care physician and Chief Quality Officer at Kaleida Health, and the care team lead for Hamlin, said: "We have completed a series of tests and evaluations, and in consultation with the team physicians, we are confident that Damar can be safely discharged to continue his rehabilitation at home and with the Bills." Hamlin was discharged from the UCMC on Monday and was sent to a medical facility in Buffalo. The 24-year-old was expected to stay for some time to complete medical tests, but has now been discharged entirely. The Bills safety posted from the hospital to confirm he had watched Sunday's regular season finale against the New England Patriots from his hospital bed, and had spoken to his team-mates. Hamlin suffered a cardiac arrest on the field during Monday Night Football against the Bengals. He took a hit from Tee Higgins in the first quarter and, despite initially getting up, fell to the canvas in horrifying scenes. Ambulance crews performed CPR on him and used a defibrillator to restart his heart, before rushing him to hospital in an ambulance. He remained in intensive care for days, before finally starting to talk again and breathing on his own.  Hamlin has earned the support of the entire NFL and sporting world, and a fundraiser set up by him to buy toys for underprivileged children at Christmas has now passed $8.7million in donations. The Bills star is now free to return to his own home for the first time since suffering the cardiac arrest, and will hope to attend a Bills game at some point during their play-off run.
