Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta is still on the hunt for January reinforcements. After missing out on Joao Felix to Chelsea, Mykhaylo Mudryk remains the priority target. Arteta has wanted a winger since the summer and the Ukraine star is his first choice. The Gunners submitted a third bid on Thursday in an attempt to get a deal over the line. Mudryk has made it clear he is keen on a move to the Emirates. Arsenal are also open to signing a striker due to the absence of Gabriel Jesus. Midfield is an area which also could be strengthened if the right opportunity comes up. Express Sport brings you all the latest from the Gunners.
