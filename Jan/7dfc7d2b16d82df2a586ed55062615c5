Ronnie O'Sullivan will be looking to get his bid to win an eighth Masters title off to the best possible start by defeating Luca Brecel in their first-round meeting this afternoon. Neil Robertson was knocked out in the first round as the defending champion by Shaun Murphy on Sunday, potentially opening the door for The Rocket to restore his dominance by going all the way at Alexandra Palace this month. O'Sullivan has already been tipped to claim the grand prize by several former players, with Neal Foulds recently telling Eurosport: "I have to be predictable and say Ronnie, in the bottom half of the draw, will be very dangerous again. I’m going to play it safe and say Ronnie can win it for the eighth time." Jimmy White, who won the event back in 1984, added: "I’m absolutely with Neal Foulds. When Ronnie lost 6-0 to Ding in the UK [Championship] I think he’d had enough snooker. "After winning them tournaments [Hong Kong Masters and Champion of Champions] he will get his nut down and practice really hard. I expect him to be in tip top condition for the Masters so I’m going to go with O’Sullivan as well."
