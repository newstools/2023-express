Peter Kay has divided opinion after allegedly evicting a heckler from his show on Saturday night. The stand-up comedian, currently on his long-awaited return to the stage for his comeback arena tour, is said to have joked after the man was removed from M&S Bank Arena in Liverpool. In videos seen by Liverpool Echo, the 49-year-old comic is sat on the stage joking about the supposed heckler being taken out of the gig. He said: "Oh, it's all kicking off here. Where's my phone? He's a bit of an a******e, he's a bit annoying. "I like a laugh, I'm a comedian but I can tell all them people round there are getting a bit nowty now. "He likes the limelight, I know I do but I'm on stage." The comedian, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, was brought to tears on his first appearance on stage in 12 years at the start of his tour last month.   His shows have been widely praised and so popular that he recently added more dates. But his approach with the heckler split judgement on the weekend. One woman tweeted: "@peterkay_co_uk absolutely top entertainment at the M&S Bank Arena last night. Expert way of dealing with a k***head heckler as well, think 13,000 people were glad to see him escorted out." Another fan, who was also at the gig, said: "Everyone around him seemed p****d off." A third posted: "@peterkay_co_uk Saw you tonight [at the] @MandSBankArena & I can honestly say, I laughed, cried & felt every emotion possible. "You are so talented & so glad you got rid of the heckler. Please continue being you." Some felt Mr Kay overreacted to the heckles. One man shared: "@peterkay_co_uk first half [was] funny tonight until you decided to throw that feller out for asking for an autograph, doesn't look good mate I thought you was one of us."
