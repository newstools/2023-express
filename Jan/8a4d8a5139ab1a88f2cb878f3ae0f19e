The January transfer window comes to a close at 11pm this evening, with clubs running out of time to get any final deals over the line. Express Sport rounds up every transfer completed on deadline day (Tuesday January 31). Chelsea, Tottenham and Arsenal could still make some exciting signings before the window shuts tonight. Enzo Fernandez, Pedro Porro and Moises Caicedo are the targets in question for each club. The Gunners could yet move on to Leicester's Youri Tielemans with Brighton standing firm that Caicedo will not be sold. Meanwhile Fernandez could become the most expensive signing ever made by a British club if he joins Chelsea from Bencia. Liverpool and Manchester United's business already done. Everton will meanwhile look to get some signings over the line for new manager Sean Dyche and Newcastle could make some late moves.
