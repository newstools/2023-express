Novak Djokovic has admitted that his Australian Open celebrations were limited on Sunday night due to several media commitments and dealing with 'doping control'. The Serbian tennis icon is one step closer to his ultimate goal of finishing his career with the most Grand Slam titles after moving level with Rafael Nadal's tally of 22. Djokovic was a picture of emotion immediately after winning his 10th Australian Open title, collapsing to the floor after shedding many tears with his family on court. But any hopes of celebrating in the immediate aftermath on Sunday night were cut short by other commitments. Asked on Monday how his celebrations went, Djokovic smiled: "With media, and with doping control. (At) 3am is when I went back to accommodation. It was a long night. "But a huge relief after the match, ending a tournament and a whole journey here to Australia with a grand slam win is always incredibly satisfying. I didn't have the chance yet to celebrate as much as I would like to. I guess that's going to come in Europe."  Djokovic was speaking on Monday while parading the Norman Brookes Challenge Cup around the gardens of Government House in Melbourne. The 35-year-old was also asked for more details on the hamstring injury that troubled him throughout the Australian Open. Currently, his next tournament is set to be the Dubai Tennis Championships at the end of February in preparation for the Sunshine Double in Indian Wells and Miami. And Djokovic appears confident that he should be in a position to stick to his current schedule.  "I'm not sure, I'm going to do some medical check-ups in the next few days," he added. "Then I'll be able to talk about it a bit more and understand the situation. "As it stands today I am still signed in for the Dubai tournament, which is in a month's time. I hope I'll be able to come back to the courts in several weeks' time. "Let's see, you know, I'll speak to the medical team and then take it from there."
