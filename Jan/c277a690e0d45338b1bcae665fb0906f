Generous increases in six-figure packages to college chiefs in the past year are said to have angered lecturers who have taken industrial action. Alice Gast, who stepped down as President of Imperial College London in July, led the university earning chart with £714,000. The American science professor, 63, had her pay boosted by more than a third.  Analysis shows the average total package for a vice-chancellor in the elite Russell Group of 24 universities increased by six percent to £413,000 in 2021-22. They include payments for grace-and-favour housing, pensions and other benefits on top of a basic salary. Jo O'Grady, General Secretary of the University and College Union, said the union had a leaderboard of the "very comfortable salaries of vice-chancellors". She said the pay totalled "a hell of a lot of money" compared to 90,000 academic staff on low-paid "insecure contracts". The union held three days of strike action in 150 universities before Christmas. For the first time, women have taken the top three spots in the university pay rankings. Louise Richardson, the outgoing Vice-Chancellor at Oxford University, took home £542,000 in 2021-22 with a rise of nearly a fifth. Baroness Shafik, of the London School of Economics, had a package of £539,000 after a 10 percent hike. Stephen Toope, who until September was Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge University, earned more than half a million pounds.  However, four universities in the Russell Group have not published their annual accounts. The Office for Students, the university watchdog, said colleges with "disproportionate pay rises" for their leaders could expect "scrutiny from staff and students as well as the general public". It has the power to fine universities if senior staff pay rises are not justified. Dame Nancy Rothwell, President and Vice-Chancellor of Manchester University, is the lowest-paid Russell Group vice-chancellor, at £276,000.
