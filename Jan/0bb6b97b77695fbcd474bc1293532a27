Ash Barty surprised the tennis world on Friday as the retired former world No 1 announced her pregnancy on Instagram. It comes as the three-time Grand Slam champion is set to return to the upcoming Australian Open in a new tennis role, mentoring wildcard Olivia Gadecki. Barty retired from tennis suddenly at the age of 25 last March when she was the world No 1 and reigning Aussie Open champion. The tennis ace dropped the news seemingly out of nowhere, with a heart-warming post via her Instagram account. Barty posted an image of her dog Origi, sweetly guarding a pair of baby shoes. The accompanying caption read: "2023 set to be the best year yet. We are so excited for our new adventure. Origi already the protective big sister." Her husband Garry Kissick also shared the announcement to his own Instagram page. The announcement comes as Barty is set to return to the Australian Open 12 months after lifting the title, becoming the first home singles champion in 44 years. The 26-year-old had been teasing her return in a new role for weeks before it was finally announced, and Barty will be mentoring young local hope Olivia Gadecki, who was awarded a wildcard into the main draw. The world No 202 revealed the news of Barty's mentorship during the recent United Cup in Sydney. "I’ve been really fortunate to always be able to contact her if I have any questions or if I need advice, she has always been there for me,” 20-year-old Gadecki told the Australian Associated Press. “The best part is she just treats me like a normal person and we can relate in that regard and off court is just as important as on court.” Barty stunned the world of tennis in 2022 when she retired just a few weeks after winning the Australian Open. She ended a 44-year wait to become the first Australian to win their home tournament in the singles since 1978. The Aussie also won the 2020 French Open and Wimbledon in 2021. Barty married Kissick last July in a small ceremony in Queensland.
