Dan Evans has claimed the controversial Davis Cup deal with Gerard Pique’s company has collapsed because players were getting paid too much. The ITF (International Tennis Federation) signed a 25-year partnership worth a staggering $3bn with the former Barcelona star’s Kosmos Tennis in 2018.  The new format saw the traditional home-and-away ties replaced with a week-long World Cup-style event at the end of the season. The format has been tweaked to stage matches in different cities before a Final 8. But the ITF yesterday announced that the 2023 event will be the fourth and last with Kosmos. British No.2 Evans said: “It is disappointing that they can't keep filling our pockets! It was a matter of time, wasn't it? We were getting paid a little too much for not a lot, I guess. But you get it whilst you can. “We changed it when I don't think it necessarily needed the whole format changing. If you go home and away, I think you're still getting a good crowd.” Evans will join a full-strength GB team to play a qualifier in Colombia next month despite his criticism of captain Leon Smith following the September group stage defeat to the Netherlands. The singles star had wanted to play in the doubles.   Asked if he cleared the air with Smith, Evans said: “No. He asked me if I would play and I said: ‘Yeah’. That was it. That was my opinion on the matter. I know in this world it's hard to tell the truth but I was brought up to tell the truth and speak your opinion and I won't change for that.” Tim Henman captained the GB team at the recent United Cup in Sydney and Evans said: “ I think it would be good if he were involved more but there are obvious things in the way of that. You have got to pay him properly and if people are willing to do that and invest in that, I don’t know.”
