Things are beginning to get very interesting indeed in the January transfer window as we approach the halfway stage of the month. Chelsea finally completed the loan signing of Atletico Madrid forward Joao Felix on Wednesday, and there could be more wheeling and dealing to be done today from some of the Premier League big boys. Manchester United's need for a new striker is no secret, and it appears that manager Erik ten Hag's No.1 target is Besiktas star Wout Weghorst. It is believed that the final touches are being put together on a deal to bring the Netherlands international to Old Trafford, and Red Devils fans will desperately be hoping it is tied up sooner rather than later. Meanwhile, Raphinha was a name linked with a whole host of clubs last summer before he eventually made the move from Leeds to Barcelona. But his spell at the Nou Camp hasn't worked out so far, and there are rumours that the likes of Arsenal and Chelsea may be interested in him again. Could there be progressions on the Brazilian's future today? And with the likes of Tottenham, Leeds and Newcastle also expected to open their chequebooks in the coming weeks, there is certainly plenty to keep your eye on as clubs up and down the country prepare to splash the cash.
