Former Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis, 52, has confessed she is “immensely here for” Prince William, 40, over one thing Prince Harry, 38, accused him of in his new book, Spare. The younger brother has been making headlines with his explosive memoir, which has given an insight into the royal family that the world has never seen before.   Emily gave her own unusual take on the book, referring to Harry’s accusation that his older brother had defied the seating plan at his wedding. “I am so here for the line in #Spare where Harry accuses William and Kate of swapping seating cards at the Sussex's wedding,” the former journalist tweeted. “And so immensely here for anyone who dares actually do that,” she added in view of her 535,700 Twitter followers. “Particularly when they are in line to the Throne. Proper respect.” READ MORE: Fern Britton inundated with support over ‘battered by life’ update     Emily’s comments come after leaked copies of Prince Harry’s memoir revealed multiple attacks on the Royal family, particularly criticising the actions of Prince William and King Charles.
