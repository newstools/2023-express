George Clooney, 61, looked very dapper as he greeted fans at the El Capitan Theatre. The Hollywood actor sported a two-piece dark blue suit paired with an unbuttoned white shirt, leaving his tie at home. He accessorised with shiny leather dress shoes, while also showing off his well-groomed appearance. George arrived at the 20th-anniversary taping of Jimmy Kimmel Live, after appearing on the first-ever episode of the late show alongside Snoop Dogg, NFL star Warren Sapp and musical guest Coldplay in 2003. He had stopped by Kimmel in 2003 to promote his film Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind, which also starred Sam Rockwell and Julia Roberts.
