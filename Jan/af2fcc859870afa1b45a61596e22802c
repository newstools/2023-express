Simon Pegg could scarcely disguise the contempt in his voice as he blasted the Prime Minister for announcing he is considering plans to make Maths compulsory in schools up until the age of 18. The horrified actor exclaimed: "F**k you, Rishi Sunak!" in a no-holds-barred Instagram rant.   The 52-year-old actor, screenwriter and producer, fiercely argued that the UK should be promoting "creativity and self-expression" instead. Mission Impossible star Simon declared: "The unelected Prime Minister twice removed has decided that it should be compulsory for children to learn Maths up until the age of 18. What a p***k! "What about arts and humanities and fostering this country's amazing reputation for creativity and self-expression?" He looked crestfallen as he added forlornly: "What about the kids who don't wanna do Maths? DON'T MISS... Kelly Monteith, beloved BBC comedian, dies aged 80 "I hated Maths. I dropped Maths as soon as I could and I've never needed it other than the skill set I acquired at the age of 12," he continued. Simon, who is the co-creator of the likes of Spaced and the Cornetto Trilogy, exclaimed: "Rishi Sunak wants a drone army of data-entering robots! "What a t****r! F**k the Tories! Get rid of them! Please! F**k you, Rishi Sunak and f**k the Tories!" He spoke out on the recent news announcement in an Instagram Stories video clip released to his 688,000 followers. Rishi is currently under fire for being the latest Tory leader who was not elected by the British public following the resignation of Liz Truss. Simon hinted that he felt the same when he referred to him as "unelected". However, Rishi gave an impassioned speech yesterday announcing that he wants the country to "reimagine [its] approach to numeracy". He insisted: "Letting our children out into the world without those skills is letting our children down." DON'T MISS...

Meanwhile, it has been claimed that 60% of disadvantaged pupils lack basic Maths skills altogether by age 16. Rishi is keen to compete with other nations, such as Finland, France, Norway and the USA, by introducing the new rules. "Right now, just half of all 16-year-olds study any maths at all," he explained. "Yet in a world where data is everywhere and statistics underpin every job, our children's jobs will require more analytical skills than ever before." However, Labour has argued that his target is unrealistic, with Keir Starmer pointing out that one in six Maths teachers in England leaves the profession after just a single year. He believes the key to success lies in tackling the severe shortage of staff members, amid a backdrop of strike action and unrest. Meanwhile, even some maths aces have taken issue with Rishi's proposal, with guest writer Kit Yates announcing in the Guardian: "As a mathematician, I fear Rishi Sunak’s plan for compulsory maths doesn’t add up."
