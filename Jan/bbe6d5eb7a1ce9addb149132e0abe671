Students and staff have been told of the death of a "cherished" schoolgirl, who has left a school community devastated. The girl attended The Arthur Terry School in Sutton in Birmingham. In a heartfelt letter to parents on Thursday, January 12, headteacher Samantha Kibble said: "It is with great sadness that I write to inform you of the tragic death of one of our Year 12 students. "She was a cherished member of our school, attending school since Year 7. "She will be missed by everybody at the school. Our thoughts are with the family at this time, and on behalf of the school community we have been in touch to offer our condolences and support.” Year 12 students have now been informed of her death and are being given the opportunity to spend time together.   The school advised parents to answer questions their children may have "factually and honestly." “Often, when someone dies, family and friends experience many feelings such as anger, confusion and sadness. The children are likely to ask questions about death and it is often best that these are answered factually and honestly. “Students have been told that their teachers will try to answer any questions they have. You may also wish to talk to your child about their understanding and feelings at this time.” Kibble informed parents that Student Support Services and further external support would offer help to pupils.  She added that there will shortly be an opportunity for Year 12 students to get together and remember their friend. “We will, in the near future, arrange for our Year 12 students to have the opportunity to remember and celebrate her life. "Thank you for your understanding." We'll be bringing you the very latest updates, pictures and video on this breaking news story.
