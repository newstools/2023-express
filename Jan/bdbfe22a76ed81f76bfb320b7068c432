British tanks being sent to Ukraine to help in the fight against Russia will "burn", the Kremlin has warned. The UK Government confirmed a squadron of Challenger 2 tanks was being send to help Volodymyr Zelensky's troops, making Britain the first Western power to supply the country with main battle tanks. Spokesman Dmitry Pesko told reporters: "The special military operation will continue. These tanks are burning and will burn." Earlier, NATO is ready to supply Ukraine with more heavy weapons in its fight against Russian invaders, secretary general Jens Stoltenberg has said in a stark warning to President Vladimir Putin. The remarks came the day after a Russian strike using a missile designed to sink ships targeted a residential building in the city of Dnipro, in the east of the country. Mr Stoltenberg told reporters in Germany: “The recent pledges for heavy warfare equipment are important - and I expect more in the near future. We are in a decisive phase of the war. We are experiencing fierce fighting. Therefore, it is important that we provide Ukraine with the weapons it needs to win - and to continue as an independent nation.” Downing Street this weekend confirmed Britain will be sending 14 Challenger 2 tanks to Ukraine, as well as 30 AS90 artillery guns, in a vital show of support to President Volodymyr Zelensky. No. 10 said the decision showed "the UK's ambition to intensify support”. The UK's support was "always strong" and "now impenetrable”, he stressed.
