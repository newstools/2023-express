The transfer rumour mill is in full swing with clubs already announcing deals just four days into winter transfer window as Premier League clubs such as Manchester United, Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool eye some mid-season additions to bolster their respective squads. Although it is typically a quiet period for deals to happen, the race for the title and top four means that managers are busy looking at ways to improve their teams this month. United boss Erik ten Hag is searching for a striker and that could well lead them towards AC Milan veteran striker Olivier Giroud as a cut-price option, with his international team-mate Randal Kolo Muani proving to be more expensive option from Eintracht Frankfurt. Elsewhere, Chelsea are hoping to complete a Â£112million deal for Benfica star Enzo Fernandez but the complex payment structure for the Argentina international means the deal has been held up as talks continue between the two parties. The Blues are also looking at Shakhtar Donetsk winger Mykhaylo Mudryk, but Arsenal remain in the driving seat after lodging a second bid for the Ukrainian starlet. Liverpool, Newcastle and Tottenham could also do some business this month with a record month of spending in sight for English clubs. FOLLOW FOR LIVE UPDATES
