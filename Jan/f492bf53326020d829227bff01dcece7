Traffic has been stopped on the M42 due to a "significant lorry fire". Pictures from the scene show a lorry engulfed in flame as traffic grinds to a halt on the busy motorway. The road has been closed as a result. It is not known if anyone has been injured in the blaze. Hereford & Worcester Fire and Rescue Service (HWFRS) are understood to have sent multiple vehicles to the scene of the incident. National Highways: West Midlands reported at 8.20pm that the "significant lorry fire" broke out on the M42 northbound between M5 and J1. Both the link road from the M5 northbound at J4a onto the M42 northbound, and the link road from M42 southbound onto the M5 northbound have also been closed. Emergency service vehicles are now on the scene, as drivers are urged to find an alternative route if possible. Express.co.uk has contacted National Highways and HWFRS for more information.  The dramatic incident comes just days after a new footbridge opened across the A45 in Solihull as part of an effort to improve the motorway. National Highways said the 92-tonne structure allows people to walk and cycle between Bickenhill and Catherine-de-Barnes, the National Exhibition Centre, Birmingham International railway station and the airport. The bridge, spanning almost 60m (196ft), was installed as part of a £282m upgrade at junction six of the M42. The overall scheme aims to improve "traffic congestion and poor journey reliability which had constrained investment and economic growth" as the junction had almost reached capacity. A new junction, J5a, is also being built on the motorway roughly 1.1 miles (1.8km) south of J6. Two new roundabouts north of the B4102 Solihull Road are also being built on either side of the motorway.
