Linda Carter (played by Kellie Bright) was not impressed when she returned home in EastEnders to find Alfie Moon (Shane Richie) behind the bar in The Vic serving a bustling crowd of Walford punters. After realising the former pub landlord was just trying to help, she agreed to give him a job before revealing she was selling the iconic pub. After throwing everyone out of The Vic, Linda confided in Alfie. She said: “Mick would have enjoyed it, he I loved a bit of karaoke.” “I guess I overreacted,” she continued but Alfie interrupted: “No, Linda you’re grieving. I can’t imagine what you're going through right now. I know we’re not together but if Kat…” “But you know what? Walford needs her ladyship back behind the bar looking all pink and classy.” Read more: EastEnders hospital tragedy and new arrival for Lola and Jay's wedding “I mean, this is where everybody comes,” he said. “This is home from home. “It's not only me you matter to but everyone else that was in here earlier and more besides. “You know what I think? I think it works both ways. I think you need them too. Linda replied: “I’m glad you’re settled at the Slaters and I can't deny you do not bring in a crowd. “You can keep working for the next couple of weeks because you're right I do need somewhere that's home but it can’t be here. “Seeing what you did today made me realise I couldn't have done that. Not now, not without Mick. “It all just reminds me of him. It’s time to sell The Vic.” EastEnders fans waisted no time in figuring out who could buy the iconic landmark.
