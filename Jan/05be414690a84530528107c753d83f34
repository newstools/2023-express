Police have arrested a man on suspicion of the murder of Elle Edwards in Wallasey on Christmas Eve. After enquiries in mid-Wales, a 22-year-old man from Wirral was arrested on suspicion of murder. A 23-year-old woman also from Wirral was arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender. Both have been taken to police stations for questioning. Detective Superintendent Sue Coombs said: “This brings the number of arrests in connection with the tragic death of Elle to five. “Although extensive work is going on from our dedicated teams across Merseyside Police and a great deal of intelligence has come in, I would still ask that anyone who has information and has yet to come forward, does so. "If they don’t want to speak to police directly then please get in touch with Crimestoppers where information can be given in confidence.” Elle, 26, was shot in the head several times while on a night out with friends outside The Lighthouse pub. Police do not believe she was the intended target. Her family paid tribute to her in an emotional statement read out by Detective Superintendent Sue Coombs during a press conference on December 30.
