As our current nuclear fleet gradually retires, we are getting a little glimpse of what life could be without nuclear: constant warnings about grid capacity, talk of blackouts, record household bills, and factories stopping production as they can’t afford spiralling gas prices. We can choose a different future. We can implement a robust version of Great British Nuclear, empowered and funded to deliver 24 GW of nuclear by 2050, as intended by the British Security Strategy. Delivering 24 GW of new nuclear means providing cheap, clean electricity for 25-30 million homes per year. It means saving 40 billion cubic metres of gas imports and cutting 75 million tonnes of carbon per year. It means creating 200,000 jobs extra per year by 2050 and revolutionising the life chances of the young people in my Ynys Môn constituency and all over the country. Backing British nuclear alongside major investment in renewables means transforming our economy into a green energy powerhouse of the twenty-first century, freed from global gas prices and the havoc they play with consumer bills. We have to make the big commitments urgently, though. Great British Nuclear, as my colleague Chris Skidmore has argued, should be set up within three months. It should have the power to tell industry what reactors will be built on which sites, and in what order, so we maximise efficiency and speed. GBN should have the power to set binding interim and final targets for nuclear delivery, and critically, it must have the funding to bring projects forward. It should offer the 20% “cornerstone” stake that the Government has taken in Sizewell C to all viable projects, to maximise market confidence and minimise costs. Doing all this will take conviction, because doing nothing is cheaper now, but devastating in five, ten and 15 years’ time. It is conviction and vision that gets us out of a crisis, and that is exactly what we need now.
