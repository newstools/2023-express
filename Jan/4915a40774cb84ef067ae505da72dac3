Meghan and Harry have been branded the "epitome of a narcissistic generation" by a broadcaster, who believes they are seeking "revenge" against the Royal Family. Emma Webb, royal watcher, broadcaster and director of the UK branch of the Common Sense Society, launched an attack on the Sussexes when asked what their "endgame" was following the release of their Netflix series. "I think they have a commercial interest in this but I think clearly from watching the last couple of episodes of the [Netflix] series, I think there is an element of revenge in this," said Ms Webb said. She added: "I think they are trying to take revenge on their family, partly for not getting exactly what they wanted." The Netflix docuseries dropped in two three-episode blocks released December 8 and 15 and caused a stir among royal watchers across the globe.  Ms Webb launched a scathing review of the series which she called "completely self indulgent" and claimed Meghan and Harry were the "epitome of a narcissistic millennial generation". However, "revenge" is only part of the story, according to Ms Webb, who noted the Sussexes were making "lots of money" off their media endeavours. She told News Nation: "There is a commercial interest in this, they are making an awful lot of money on this at the expense of the British [Royal Family]." Meghan and Harry say the Netflix series shows their side of the story with regards to their split with the Firm.
