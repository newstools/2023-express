Eighty-one-year-old Martha Stewart recently posted a set of selfies that has fans aghast over her incredibly smooth complexion. The businesswoman, who famously served five months in federal prison, posted the selfie to her 1.7M followers. Not everyone took the millionaire at her word, however, one wrote: "Absolutely no re-imaging, come on, please. Please be truthful honest and real." Soon after Martha followed the post up with another featuring three more selfies, in what seems like a backlash against negative comments. She wrote: "These are the other three selfies I took. My expression was better in the first one but my skin looks great in all of them. Unfiltered. No facelift." The mogul even took the opportunity to shout out her favourite skin experts. She wrote: "Great derms my whole life. Currently Dr. Daniel Belkin and Dr. Dhaval Bhanusali." She added that she follows a "Geat diet, great exercise and did I mention amazing facials @mariobadescu for the last forty years!" Nevertheless, some were still skeptical. One commenter wrote: "You look amazing but be honest about your facial regimen. Using Botox, fillers, laser treatments, etc. to help enhance your beauty itâ€™s not just diet, exercise, and facials."

In it, she puts cucumbers, parsley, mint, ginger, orange, celery, and pineapple. As well as eating her famous healthy home-cooked recipes, Martha likes to spend a lot of time outdoors riding her horses. The millionaire wrote on her website: "I love practicing yoga to keep my muscles long, limber, and flexible and I also work out at least three times a week with my trainer, Mary Tedesco, who shows up bright and early at the farm." Always take your makeup off Martha always takes her makeup off before she goes to bed, she told friend and makeup artist Gucci Westman in a YouTube video. She takes her makeup off with a popular bathroom cabinet product, baby oil. She said: "You'll think I'm so stupid but, if I have a lot of makeup on like from a TV show or something, I use baby oil. Whatever kind comes in the little jar. I also like simple things like Mario Badescu. I've been going to them since Mr. Badescu himself was alive."
