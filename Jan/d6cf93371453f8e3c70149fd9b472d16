 Prince Harry was born third in line to the throne but is currently in fifth position behind his brother Prince William and children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. Harry’s tell-all memoir Spare was published earlier this month and made a series of allegations against the Royal Family, so do you think he should lose his place in the line of succession? Vote in our poll.  His controversial memoir has shared insight into the tensions between the Duke of Sussex and the Firm and resulted in fresh calls for Harry and his wife Meghan Markle to lose their royal titles. The couple relocated to California after stepping down from their royal duties three years ago, where they are raising their two children – three-year-old Archie and one-year-old Lilibet – who are sixth and seventh in line to the throne respectively. Their decision to leave the firm resulted in Harry losing several of his patronages and honorary military titles but retained his dukedom and position in line to the throne.
