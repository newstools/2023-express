NBA fans were perplexed after a play in the first quarter of the Golden State Warriors recent chaotic win over the Atlanta Hawks. The game would go on to be a high-scoring affair, with the Warriors winning 143-141 with Klay Thompson scoring 54 points as he continues in his incredible stretch, announcing himself back as an elite player after two years away from the sport with serious injuries. But it was early on in the game which had the social media world talking, in a play dubbed the 'teleportation pass' confusing thousands. As the Warriors advanced the ball up the court, Green held the ball and looked to set a screen for Thompson to find the three-point specialist open. Somehow, with the ball looking like it remained in Green's hands, it vanished from the on-lookers screens, and ended up in possession with Thompson, with one saying: "Did my eyes deceive me or did Green just use teleportation to make that pass?". Obviously, there's an explanation to the pass. But even if you watch closely, slowed down on numerous occasions, it's still tough to see. As Green's back was turned to the camera, along with Thompson coming round a screen set by the Warriors forward, he made a bounce-pass perfectly in time to hide the ball from the camera-angle which we were given. With both players being so tall, the camera could not pick up on the angle, with many slowing the footage down on Twitter and still being baffled as to how the pass was made. The pass was a great play by Green, who made it behind his back, not-looking at Thompson whilst delivering a perfect bounce-pass.  And if you still aren't convinced by this, the NBA have since released footage from a different angle which shows Green's bounce-pass. It was one of many impressive passes from Green on the night, who had 11 assists and has been a huge part of the Warriors turn around along with Thompson's recent revival.
