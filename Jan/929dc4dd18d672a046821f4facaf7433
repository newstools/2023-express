Prospective buyers of ammonium nitrate – used in both fertilisers and explosives – will need a licence, the Daily Express understands. Hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, hexamine and sulphur have also been added to a list of chemicals where shops and online sellers have to report all suspicious purchases. The Home Office said this “will prevent access to materials of the highest concern for illicit purposes”. Police say the change will give them greater access to vital intelligence. Shops and businesses will also need to report significant losses or thefts of all items on the list. Security minister Tom Tugendhat said: “Businesses and individuals use various chemicals for a wide range of legitimate uses. "We must also minimise the risk posed by the illicit use of bomb-making materials and poisons. "It is our responsibility to ensure our robust controls of these substances are updated.” Matt Jukes, Met Police assistant commissioner and head of counter-terrorism policing, said: “Reports from the public, including industry and businesses, play a vital role in how we tackle the terrorist threat. “These new measures will serve to enhance how we receive information and intelligence...and also enable us to take targeted and robust enforcement action to keep people safe.”
