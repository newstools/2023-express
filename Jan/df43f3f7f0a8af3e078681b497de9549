The entire building – a former school in Makiivka, Donetsk – collapsed as ­ammunition stored inside detonated. Armoured vehicles were also destroyed, when hundreds of troops were killed in the strike on New Year’s Eve. The attack came as President Vladimir Putin was giving his New Year’s address. The Ukrainian military later mocked Russia, warning troops against “smoking in ­inappropriate places” and claiming that it had killed “about 400” people and wounded another 300. Just one two-storey wall was left standing among the smouldering debris after Ukraine’s assault on the Russian base. Igor Girkin, a separatist military veteran turned commentator, said hundreds had been killed and wounded, and the building itself “almost completely destroyed”. He claimed the victims were mainly recent conscripts, rather than those who had chosen to fight. And he also said ammunition was stored in the same building as the soldiers. After more than a day and a half of silence, the Russian defence ministry finally said 63 soldiers had died at the barracks. Kremlin supporters were furious that the men had been massed in a building that was an obvious target. And exiled Russian journalist Alexander Nevzorov said many of the dead and wounded were buried in the ­rubble, but no significant effort was being made to locate or rescue them. He said: “The uncounted and uninteresting bodies will remain to rot under the concrete rubble. Soldiers’ meat in Russia is so cheap that it makes no sense to count.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of “energy terrorism” as the aerial bombardments continue which have left many people without heat amid freezing temperatures. Kyiv say Putin is “weaponising winter” in a bid to demoralize resistance. But Ukraine is using sophisticated Western weapons to down missiles and drones.
