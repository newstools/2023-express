Michelle Keegan, 35, looked better than ever as she took to the red carpet at Atlantis The Royal Grand Reveal Weekend. The former Coronation Street star suffered a near wardrobe malfunction due to her busty display in the red mini dress. Michelle covered her modesty by holding her hands up to her chest as she posed for pictures. The actress stunned in the busy red mini dress, exposing her ample assets while also giving a rather leggy display. She accessorised with red heels, red globes and a gold clutch as she posed alongside her husband Mark Wright.
