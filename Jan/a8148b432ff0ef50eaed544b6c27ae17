Serbia maintains a long-standing and historic relationship with Russia, with Belgrade often facing criticism for leaning too much toward Moscow. The reaction to the Wagner video however has demonstrated that ties between Serbia and Russia have grown increasingly complex following Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

It has been reported that Wagner, a Russian private military company, has been recruiting former prisoners to fight in Ukraine. According to the Washington Post, the United States estimates that Wagner has a total of 50,000 troops in Ukraine, with 40,000 of them being convicts recruited from prisons. Other sources also indicate this recruitment of convicts, for instance, one Russian magazine has reported that Wagner is recruiting convicts from inside St Petersburg prisons, promising them 200,000 rubles (£2,400) for six months and freedom if they survive the conflict. Moreover, Wagner has also tried to recruit inmates from prisons in the Central African Republic.
