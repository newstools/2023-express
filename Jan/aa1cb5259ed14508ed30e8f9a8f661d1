The opening Grand Slam of the year kicks off next week, as the world’s best tennis players head to Melbourne for this year’s Australian Open. Two of Britain’s biggest names will be there with both Andy Murray and Emma Raducanu entered into the main draw. There were concerns Raducanu was set to miss the clash due to a recent injury to her ankle picked up in New Zealand. However the 2021 US Open champion has passed a late fitness test, and will take on Germany’s Tamara Korpatsch in her tournament opener. Murray meanwhile will kick off his hunt for a first ever Australian Open title against Italy’s Matteo Berrettini on Tuesday. One big name who will be returning to the opening Grand Slam of the year is nine-time winner Novak Djokovic. Ther Serbian star dramatically missed last year’s event after being deported from Australia due to his Covid vaccination status. The Serbian was initially held in quarantine in Melbourne before a judge ordered he be sent home to Serbia. The man who capitalised on Djokovic’s absence in 2022 was long-time rival Rafael Nadal. The Spaniard secured a famous victory in Melbourne last year as he defeated Russian star Daniil Medvedev in the final to secure the title. The Spanish star will begin the defence of his Australian Open crown against England’s Jack Draper in the early hours of Monday morning. Djokovic meanwhile will play his first Australian Open game in two years against Nadal’s countryman Roberto Carballés Baena.
