The Australian Open is back in full swing on day three of the tournament in what is set to be another hectic schedule. Play on Tuesday was severely disrupted due to extreme heat before torrential downpour ended up seeing matches rescheduled for today. In total, 22 first-round matches had to be moved to Wednesday with more rain expected today at Melbourne Park. Tuesday saw Andy Murray pick up arguably the biggest shock of the tournament as he beat Matteo Berrettini in a five-set thriller. The near-five hour contest saw Murray take a two-set lead before the Italian fought back to force a decider. But the Brit was able to rally back to win the 10-point tiebreak and set up a second-round match against Thanasi Kokkinakis. Rafael Nadal is back in action after he survived a scare against Jack Draper in the opening day of the tournament. However, all eyes will be on Emma Raducanu's blockbuster clash with Coco Gauff on Rod Laver Arena later in the evening.
