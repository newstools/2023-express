Carol Vorderman, 62, joked that she feared her make-up free face would “frighten children” as she put her natural beauty on display in a social media video. The former Countdown star filmed herself on Friday morning during her commute into work in London while it was still dark outside. In view of her 290,000 Instagram followers, Carol said: "On my way to work, and I'll see you on This Morning when I've got some make-up on. And I won't frighten the children, hopefully." Later in the morning, Carol shared an update from ITV’s This Morning studios looking very different as she wore glam makeup and a show-stopping outfit. For her appearance on the show, Carol chose a stylish look consisting of a denim jumpsuit and black heeled boots. In the pictures, Carol, who had her hair styled in luscious waves, posed alongside her co-stars - Dermot O’Leary, Alison Hammond and Gyles Brandreth.
