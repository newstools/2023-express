During his playing career, John McEnroe was famed for courting controversy and was even disqualified from the 1990 Australian Open altogether after one such outburst. During his fourth round match against Mikael Pernfors, McEnroe became the first player since 1963 to be disqualified from a Grand Slam event. After a close call went the way of Pernfors, McEnroe approached the lineswoman and glared at her. This prompted umpire Gerry Armstrong to issue him a warning, before McEnroe was then docked a point for 'racket abuse' after smashing it on the ground when a shot went wide. McEnroe was furious with the decision and disputed it with the tournament's chief supervisor Ken Farrar, who refused to overturn the decision. McEnroe then reportedly yelled "'Just go f*** your mother" to a supervisor, prompting him to be disqualified. McEnroe had fallen foul of new ATP Tour rules that had only come into effect that month, which stated that if a player was cited for unsportsmanlike conduct three times in a match then they would be disqualified.
