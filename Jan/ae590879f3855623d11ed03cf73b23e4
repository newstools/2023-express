Chelsea star Joao Felix was brutally trolled by Fulham on social media following his red card on his debut - before the tweet was swiftly deleted. Graham Potter decided to throw Felix straight into the starting line-up just days after the striker signed on loan from Atletico Madrid.  And there were glimpses in the first 45 minutes of his talents with the forward creating several goalscoring opportunities. But his first match in Chelsea colours ended in misery after being shown a straight red card for a tackle on Kenny Tete. Fulham players immediately surrounded the referee demanding Felix be sent off. The match official appeared to wait for confirmation in his year from VAR for his final verdict before pulling out a red card. Felix was left motionless after being given his marching orders, but replays quickly showed why the decision was made. The on-loan attacker went in for the tackle with his studs up and failed to make any attempt to avoid smashing into Tete.

Football fans began begging Fulham to re-publish the original tweet. There seemed to be no debate about the colour of the card shown to Felix by the referee.  Former Premier League official Peter Walton agreed with the onfield decision. "He has lunged in, there is no intention of course, but he's gone in too high," Walton said on BT Sport. "It's the right decision for me. He has endangered the opposition." It now means Felix will be unavailable for Chelsea's next three games, including a trip to Liverpool in two weeks. The striker won't be able to play again until Chelsea's trip to Fulham on February 11.
