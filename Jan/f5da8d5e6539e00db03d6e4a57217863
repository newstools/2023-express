Novak Djokovic is the Australian Open champion for the 10th time after brushing past Stefanos Tsitsipas in Sunday's final. The 35-year-old ended up pouring out his emotions immediately after his win, jumping up to the stands to celebrate with his family and collapsing to the floor in tears. It brought an end to what proved to be a wild few weeks for Djokovic, who was making his return to Melbourne for the first time since being controversially deported 12 months ago. Djokovic admitted that the whole saga from last year's tournament acted as inspiration for him to go all the way this time around. A troublesome hamstring injury threatened to derail his title hopes, but he appeared to recover in the second week of the tournament, not dropping a single set against Alex de Minaur, Andrey Rublev, Tommy Paul or even Tsitsipas in the final. He's now returned to the No 1 spot in the world rankings but, arguably more important to Djokovic, is the fact he's now level with Rafael Nadal on 22 Grand Slam titles. The two tennis icons are now neck-and-neck in the race to finish their careers with the most majors heading into the French Open in May. There's still plenty of reaction to Djokovic's win at the Australian Open on Sunday. Express Sport is on hand to provide all the latest.
