The January transfer window is now taking shape with Manchester United, Chelsea, Arsenal and others putting plans into action. The Blues have not found it difficult to conduct business in what is traditionally considered to be the trickier of the two windows, while the Gunners and the Red Devils are taking a slower approach. United boss Erik ten Hag and Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta are still in need of reinforcements, however, with a top-four push and a Premier League title charge respectively at stake. Cristiano Ronaldo's exit from Old Trafford has left the club looking for a new striker but big spending in the summer has forced them to take a more creative approach, with loan deals thought to be a priority. Arsenal are ready to spend big money with Mykhaylo Mudryk negotiations hanging in the balance while Chelsea have already continued their spree from the summer, when new co-owner Todd Boehly set the record for the most money spent by one club in a single window.
