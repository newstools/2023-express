The Masked Singer UK's comeback this weekend saw a string of mystery celebrities taking to the stage in weird and wacky costumes. As the stars performed, judges Davina McCall, Jonathan Ross, Rita Ora and Mo Gilligan tried to figure out who was hiding behind the masks. Joel Dommett was also back to front the ITV talent show. However, just minutes into the programme, fans were left distracted by Joel's appearance. The presenter took to the stage in a dashing mint green suit, and some fans felt it was a bit much. One fan even claimed to "switch off" the programme as a result. Philip Lickley wrote: "With a suit like that, I assume Joel will be selling ice creams during the break? #TheMaskedSinger #TheMaskedSingerUK."

While user @AshB29242620 joked: "#TheMaskedSinger I saw Joel and thought of a packet of Trebor mints..." "WTF is Joel wearing," User @SocialMediaJon1 asked before adding: "I’ve had to switch over to Eastenders. #TheMaskedSinger #ITV." However, some fans loved Joel's outfit choice, with Gemma tweeting: "Catching up on #TheMaskedSinger as I was at work. I have to say I love the colour of Joel Dommetts’ suit. So glad to have this show back." Jodie Robins added: "I b****y love #TheMaskedSinger and I'm not even a little bit sorry and Joel Dommett in his amazing suits is just the cherry on top." After the first six celebrities performed for the first time on Sunday, one was finally revealed. Ghost became the first character to be unmasked as football pundit and presenter Chris Kamara. When chatting with Joel about taking part in the show, Kammy said: “I did it for the grandkids.

"Not even my wife knows so it’s going to be a surprise for the whole family. "I’m not the best at keeping secrets so I’m not sure what will shock them most, taking part in the show or keeping it a secret." When discussing the challenges of wearing the Ghost costume, the presenter added: "It was tough. "The view was really restrictive which takes a lot of getting used to. "I really enjoyed it though it was really fun. I love singing so enjoy any chance I get to sing." Next Saturday the remaining characters, Fawn, Jacket Potato, Piece of Cake, Pigeon, Rhino and Rubbish will be taking to the stage to sing in disguise. The Masked Singer continues on Saturday at 7pm on ITV.
