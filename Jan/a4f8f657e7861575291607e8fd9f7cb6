But she’s still there a lot of the time because they kinda have the care of Ryan.“Clare’s in a good place this time around, I think the second series we saw her and she’d fallen off the wagon but that’s not happened for some time, as far as we know.” Touching on her first day on set back in 2014, the actress confessed she was extremely nervous.She recalled: “My first day of filming on Series one was in the mission - Clare answering a call from Catherine.“I think Clare was preparing a sandwich but I can’t remember what the conversation was about. I will have been a nervous wreck, I always am day one of a job.Along with the final series focusing on the deep-rooted rift between Tommy and Catherine, viewers will also see a local pharmacist in another part of the valley get in over his head when a neighbour is arrested.
