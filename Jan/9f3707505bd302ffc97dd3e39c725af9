Major League Baseball star Shohei Ohtani could sign a new contract worth double Cristiano Ronaldo's megabucks Saudi Arabia deal, reports suggest. Ohtani is heading into a contract year with the Los Angeles Angels, and could become the most sought-after free agent of all time. Ohtani, 28, is widely regarded as the best player in baseball at the moment. He enjoyed a standout season last year, but was unable to inspire the Angels to the post-season. Now, he will enter the 2023 season knowing it could be his last in Anaheim, as his contract will expire at the end of the season. Ohtani will likely be one of the most sought-after players in MLB free agency history, and there has been speculation he could ink the biggest contract in sporting history. According to ESPN, Ohtani could sign a contract worth an extortionate $500million - over at least ten years - bettering Ronaldo's deal with Al-Nassr. Serial Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo signed a contract worth $75m per year over the course of five years. Ohtani will also benefit from the fact the 2023 free agency class isn't loaded with talent, so the number of players commanding big salaries will be limited. The Los Angeles Dodgers are reportedly interested, as are the New York Mets and the San Francisco Giants. The Mets had a $315m contract ready to go for free agent Carlos Correa during the current offseason, and only pulled out of the deal after issues emerged with his medical. One MLB executive apparently told ESPN they felt Ohtani could realistically obtain a 12-year contract worth $480m, which would be the largest contract in sporting history. NFL star Patrick Mahomes signed a ten-year contract with the Kansas City Chiefs in 2020 worth $450m - but it should be noted that a huge amount of that is tied up in incentives, and only $141m is guaranteed.
