Andie MacDowell, 64, showed age is just a number as she took to the red carpet for the premiere of her new Hallmark series The Way Home. The Hollywood actress proudly flaunted her silver locks as she went for a ringlet shoulder length hairstyle. Andie sported an off-white turtleneck, paired with a two-piece oversized black beaded suit, showing off her sense of style. She showed off her ageless complexion with her flawless makeup consisting of a rosy blush, gloss lip and a smokey eye. The upcoming show chronicles three generations of a family after one woman reunites with her mother following a years-long estrangement.
