EastEnders fans will know Patsy Kensit is joining the soap as Lola’s mum Emma. Emma left behind Lola and her father when the hairdresser was just three-years-old. Speaking about joining the soap, Patsy Kensit said: "I’m so excited to be visiting Walford for this storyline. It has always been a dream of mine to appear in EastEnders. The cast, producers, writers and crew have been wonderful, and I’ve had a ball. Thank you so much for having me." Describing Emma, executive producer Chris Clenshaw added: "Softly spoken and measured, on one hand, Emma is the very opposite of her long lost daughter, Lola. “But on the other, there’s a striking resemblance; successful, the capacity to hold her own – if she says she’ll do something, she’ll do it – and she’s a fighter, just like Lola. "Having spent a lifetime apart, Emma becomes desperate to make up for lost time, but her secret sadness and guilt are never far from the surface. “The burden of losing her daughter has never left her, but can she find the courage to tell her shocking truth and reconnect with Lola, or will it come too little, too late?" EastEnders airs on BBC One from Monday to Thursday at 7.30pm.
