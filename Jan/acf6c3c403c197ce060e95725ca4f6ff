Those of us who enjoy a trip to our local Wetherspoons will be pleased to hear that the popular pub chain has announced a major change to its breakfast menu. Now, their breakfasts will be available until noon - seven days a week. In a statement posted on its website, the chain announced the news, revealing: "Wetherspoon’s pubs have a huge range of breakfast options to start your day – and it is now available until the extended time of 12 noon, seven days a week. "Our breakfast menu includes traditional breakfast dishes, from a full cooked breakfast to MOMA Porridge, served plain or with the option to top with banana and honey, as well as our breakfast muffins and range of Benedicts." Up until now, breakfasts have only been available until 11.30 am, although this varied from restaurant to restaurant. Now, you'll have an extra 30 minutes to get your orders in and enjoy a fry-up or even a breakfast muffin.    And this isn't the only change announced by the chain recently. In fact, Wetherspoons is also cutting the cost of a number of items until January 17, across venues in England and Wales. For example, prices for drinks are starting from just 99p. This means customers will be able to get Carlsberg, Guinness and Ciders at slashed prices. Customers will be able to get reduced prices on a range of spirits too.  Coffee and soft drinks across 810 pubs will be reduced to 99p. "Department stores and shops hold their sales in January, so it is the perfect time to have a sale in the pub too," explained Tim Martin, Wetherspoon founder and chairman. "The range of drinks and food on sale in the pub is aimed at suiting a wide variety of tastes. "This year we have included our biggest selection of low and non-alcoholic drinks."
