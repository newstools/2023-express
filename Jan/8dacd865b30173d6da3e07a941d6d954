Salma Hayek made jaw drops on Instagram as she rocked a daring neckline while celebrating her friend Marc Anthony’s wedding. The Magic Mike actress attended the nuptials of the American singer, 54, and his fourth wife, Nadia Ferreira, 23, while wearing a beautiful Giambattista Valli dress. Before getting in the car to make her way to the wedding, Salma staged a smouldering impromptu photoshoot. She displayed her exquisite diamond jewellery, smoky eye makeup and red lip. In the caption, she tagged the newlyweds and wrote, “Long live love […] And long live salsa”, in Spanish. Marc’s close friends David and Victoria Beckham were also in attendance.
