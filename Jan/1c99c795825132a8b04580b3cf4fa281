Sebastian Vettel has reflected on a dramatic clash with Lewis Hamilton at the 2017 Azerbaijan Grand Prix following his retirement, admitting he was in the wrong and calling the incident a "key moment" in their friendship. During the race, Vettel was handed a 10-second stop-go penalty for making contact with Hamilton's car in apparent retaliation for what he believed was Hamilton "brake testing" him. Hamilton was furious with Vettel's actions, describing them as "disgusting". "The fact that that's the only kind of result [the penalty] you could get from such disgusting driving, that means for the whole paddock we can all drive like that and you can still score fourth place and still get away with it," he told Sky Sports at the time. "I don't really know what the penalty for that kind of driving is because I haven't come across that in terms of wheel-to-wheel battling with anyone. "I can't really remember coming across that, particularly in Formula 1. It's just not sportsman conduct."
