Germany will come under pressure from a coalition of Ukraine’s European backers on Friday over its hesitancy to allow its Leopard 2 tanks to be sent into battle, as top Western officials warned there is “a risk of a massive assault” around the frontline in the next few weeks. The group, likely to be led by Poland, who on Thursday reiterated that it was “ready to donate a company (14) of Leopard 2s”, is expected to have significant support, with at least another two of the twelve nations in possession of the military vehicles telling reporters that they will send their main battle tanks as soon as Germany permits it. The tanks could prove vital to fighting Russia along the 620-mile frontline after European Council President Charles Michel said “the following weeks could be decisive in Ukraine”. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz reportedly said on Wednesday during a meeting with US lawmakers at the World Economic Forum that Berlin would not authorise the transfer of its tanks.
