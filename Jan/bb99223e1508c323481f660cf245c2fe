Officers initially believed the woman may have been seeking shelter from Storm Elliott and died in the bin from exposure. The corpse was located between a car dealership and a motel in Lugoff, South Carolina, on Saturday morning. The US east coast state saw temperatures drop to a freezing low of -11C at on Christmas Eve amid the winter blast. However, Kershaw County Sheriff Lee Boan said: "Unfortunately, it appears the body has possibly been there for months." Sheriff Boan told outlets TND/WACH the body was “badly decomposed and mostly skeletal”.
