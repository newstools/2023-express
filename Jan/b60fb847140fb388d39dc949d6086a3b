Amelia Dimoldenberg, 28, looked fantastic as she took to the red carpet at the 80th annual Golden Globe Awards. The Chicken Shop Date creator and TV presenter chose a risqué cut-out sheer dress for the special appearance. Amelia’s floor-length beige gown featured a high thigh slit that put her toned legs and strappy heeled sandals on display. The comedian completed the look by styling her luscious auburn hair in waves and added a pop of colour with red lipstick. She accessorised with a pair of gold hoop earrings and an earthy-toned eyeshadow to finish off the stellar look.
