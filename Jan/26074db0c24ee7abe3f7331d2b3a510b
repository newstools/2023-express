Prince George has been praised for having an "eye for colour" after the nine-year-old produced a festive painting of a reindeer. Wrendale Designs' Hannah Dale claimed George's work was "lovely" and showed an impressive command of watercolours. The Prince's painting depicted a reindeer with robins perched on his body and antlers. She told Hello! Magazine: "I think having a love of animals and love of nature is obviously something that's maybe captured his attention." Ms Dale, from Lincolnshire, added: "That inspires me very much." She also explained how it was a "lovely surprise" to see the post shown on her social media feed. JUST IN: King Charles' coronation could be 'invalidated' due to his affair with Camilla Dale recognised it was potentially influenced by one of her Christmas card designs. George's parents, Prince William and Kate Middleton, both 40, used the painting to wish Instagram followers a Merry Christmas. The post received more than 650,000 likes and many supporters took to the comments to praise the Prince. User @ourfrenchtails said: "You have an artist in the family! Joyeux Noël!" Another account, named @charlottearvidson, added: "Prince George is so talented! Happy Christmas to you all." User @schippergerwin wrote: "That would be an awesome Christmas card."
