A huge police manhunt operation is underway for a murderer who has gone on the run from an open prison. Paul Gerrard, formerly of Lodge Road, Manchester, was sentenced to life in prison aged 27 in July 2009 following the death of David Argent, 29, in February 2009. Gerrard is now at large, having absconded from HMP Kirkham, an open prison in Lancashire. In a statement issued today following an inquiry regarding Gerrard’s absconsion, an HM Prison Service spokesperson told the Liverpool Echo: “HMP Kirkham is urgently working with police to recapture the offender. “Those who abscond from open prison will be moved back to closed conditions and face extra time in jail.”  The Echo reports Gerrard was convicted of murder at trial in July 2009 alongside Gerrard Harper, then 39 and of Shepherds Row, Runcorn, after they lured Mr Argent to a flat in Castlefields in July 2008 and beat him unconscious. Friends had warned Mr Argent not to go but once there he was brutally attacked as Gerrard and Harper punched him to the ground and stamped on his head. Mr Argent, who had endured a campaign of intimidation in the time leading up to the vicious attack and who grew up in Netherley, Liverpool, lost consciousness and was rushed to hospital where he remained in a coma for eight months until his death. Gerrard and Harper were convicted of murder after trial at Chester Crown Court and jailed for a minimum of 14 years each in prison.
