Anyone using an older Intel-powered MacBook Pro might want to consider an urgent upgrade. Apple has announced the launch of its latest laptops which will offer a performance boost that's up to six times faster than its previous PCs. Of course, the US technology giant refreshed its MacBook Pro lineup back in October 2021 with the launch of M1-powered machines but this latest reboot takes things to a whole new level. The new range, which includes a 14-inch and 16-inch model, all feature Apple’s next-generation of silicon called M2 Pro and M2 Max. These brains should help to push performance and efficiency to a new level with tasks made faster and battery life lasting longer. In fact, Apple is promising that its latest Pro models will render graphics six times faster than older Intel models and offer users 22 hours of life - that's the longest ever in a MacBook. Other new features arriving on these laptops include support for speedy Wi-Fi 6 broadband and these laptops support 8K displays for the first time. That means you can plug them into a top-notch monitor and get a pin-sharp picture. Those buying a machine with the M2 Pro will get either a 10- or 12-core CPU with up to eight high-performance and four high-efficiency cores. Upgrade to the ultimate M2 Max and things are improved to include a much larger GPU featuring up to 38 cores with up to 96GB of unified memory. Just like the previous 2021 models, there's also a Liquid Retina XDR display, 1080p FaceTime HD camera, six-speaker sound system and studio-quality mics. Owners also get plenty of ports including USB-C, SD card reader and MagSafe charging which pops out should someone trip on the cable. “MacBook Pro with Apple silicon has been a game changer, empowering pros to push the limits of their workflows while on the go and do things they never thought possible on a laptop,” said Greg Joswiak, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. “Today the MacBook Pro gets even better. With faster performance, enhanced connectivity, and the longest battery life ever in a Mac, along with the best display in a laptop, there’s simply nothing else like it.” If you fancy one, the new MacBook Pro models with M2 Pro and M2 Max are available to order today, January 17 The 14-inch MacBook Pro with M2 Pro starts at £2149 and the 16-inch MacBook Pro with M2 Pro starts at £2699.
