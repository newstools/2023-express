Katy Perry, 38, was this week's special guest on Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop podcast - and she didn't hesitate to get glammed up for the occasion, sporting bright pink lipstick and long lashes. Gwyneth, 50, revealed in last week's podcast episode with Kim Kardashian that she can't stand wearing makeup and longs to "scrape it off" her face on the rare occasions that she still wears it. However, the same didn't seem to be true of Fireworks hitmaker Katy when she turned up with a full face of makeup. Fans took to social media and addressed her "unreal" look, with one fan quizzing: "Is this the Katy Perry wax figure?" Meanwhile, another jibed: "Drag race promo shot?" However, there were other posts which were more admiring of Katy, with one Instagrammer declaring both women "beautiful".
