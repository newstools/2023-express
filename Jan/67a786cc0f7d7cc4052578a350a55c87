In today’s Oscar nominations, the Elvis Presley movie has received eight nods, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Austin Butler. Stars who play famous dead people are usually the favourite to win such gongs, although the 31-year-old has tough competition against The Whale star Brendan Fraser who won the Critics’ Choice Award. Nevertheless, the Elvis star did pick up the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Drama, which was witnessed by The King’s daughter Lisa Marie Presley just two days before her sudden death of a cardiac arrest at 54. Butler thanked Lisa Marie in his speech and said how much he loved her before finding himself attending her funeral at Graceland less than two weeks later. Incredibly, before she died Lisa Marie predicted that the star who she believes finally got her father right, will win the Best Actor Oscar. Back in May last year, Lisa Marie broke her social media silence having been mourning the death of her 27-year-old son Benjamin Keough for the best part of a year. Elvis’ daughter had a very special reason for doing so though, having finally watched Baz Luhrmann’s biopic and adored it, especially Butler’s portrayal. Lisa Marie wrote with months left to live: “Hello everyone, I haven’t posted in quite some time because there really isn’t much to say, as I am and will forever be mourning the loss of my son. Navigating through this hideous grief that absolutely destroyed and shattered my heart and my soul into almost nothing has swallowed me whole. Not much else aside from my other 3 children gets my time and attention anymore. However, that being said, I do want to take a moment to let you know that I have seen Baz Luhrmann's movie “Elvis” twice now, and let me tell you that it is nothing short of spectacular. Absolutely exquisite. Austin Butler channeled and embodied my father’s heart and soul beautifully.” And then she spoke of the 2023 Academy Awards.

(If he doesn’t get an Oscar for this, I will eat my own foot, haha.) You can feel and witness Baz’s pure love, care, and respect for my father throughout this beautiful film, and it is finally something that myself and my children and their children can be proud of forever. What moved me to tears as well was watching Riley and Harper, and Finley afterwards, all 3 visibly overwhelmed in the best way possible way, and so filled with pride about their grandfather and his legacy in a way that I have not previously experienced.” DON'T MISSAustin Butler wears all black days after Lisa Marie Presley's death [AUSTIN BUTLER]Elvis star Austin Butler 'heartbroken' over Lisa Marie Presley's death [LISA DEATH]Elvis' Austin Butler's speech showing 'love' for Lisa Marie goes viral [GOLDEN GLOBES] Lisa Marie added: “It breaks my heart that my son isn’t here to see it.
