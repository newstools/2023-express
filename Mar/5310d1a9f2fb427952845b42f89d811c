Destiny 2 developer Bungie has taken the game offline for an extended period of server maintenance on PlayStation, Xbox and PC. The downtime will give Bungie the ability to make fixes ahead of Lightfall's new Root of Nightmares Raid, which kicks off at 5pm GMT UK time on March 10. According to a tweet by Bungie, alongside a full schedule for the latest period of server downtime. "DESTINY 2 MAINTENANCE," reads a Bungie tweet. Hotfix 7.0.0.3. Maintenance has begun. REMAINING TIMELINE - Player Removal: 8:45 AM PST (-8 UTC). Log in: 9 AM. End: 12 PM." Based on a post on the Bungie support page, there's a chance Destiny 2 will be back online at 6pm GMT UK time, instead of the 8pm time mentioned in the tweet. While the update isn't expected to make any major changes, it should steady the ship for the Root of Nightmares Raid. Express Online will keep this article updated with the latest patch notes when Bungie makes them available to the public. Bungie has also given players one or two tips for avoiding any issues updating to version 7.0.0.3. Console players are encouraged to restart their systems if they encounter problems trying to update the game. Players will need to update to the latest version in order to access the Root of Nightmares Raid. The new Destiny 2 Raid will go live at 5pm GMT on March 10. Like past Raids, Bungie is holding a competition to see which clan completes it first. Contest Mode will be available for 48-hours, so good luck trying to win the race. Ferried from an unknown time and place, a haunting presence has been detected. We must now confront the ancient threat growing at our doorstep. The Root of Nightmares raid opens on March 10, 2023 at 9am PST. Contest Mode will be enabled for 48 hours.
