The widow of Los Angeles Lakers icon Kobe Bryant settled her claims with Los Angeles County regarding shared photos of the 2020 helicopter crash that took the lives of the NBA legend, daughter Gianna and seven others. The total reparations include the $15m (£12.5m) already awarded in her invasion of privacy lawsuit against Los Angeles County in August 2022. Following that decision, the Los Angeles Times reported Mrs Bryant would give proceeds from the money to the Mamba and Mambacita Sports foundation - the non-profit, founded in 2016 as the Mamba Sports Foundation, and renamed after the deaths of Kobe and Gianna, a rising basketball star - “to shine a light on Kobe and Gigi’s legacy.” The foundation provides funding and sports programming for underserved athletes to “enable participation in school and/or league sports that enrich socio-emotional and physical development,” the charity's mission statement reads.

The Altobelli and Mauser families, whose loved ones were also victims of the crash, received a million dollars each after they had sued the county for invasion of privacy and negligence. Lawyers for Mrs Bryant welcomed the outcome and praised their clients courage, saying: "Today marks the successful culmination of Mrs Bryant's courageous battle to hold accountable those who engaged in this grotesque conduct. “She fought for her husband, her daughter, and all those in the community whose deceased family were treated with similar disrespect. We hope her victory at trial and this settlement will put an end to this practice." Mira Hashmall, the attorney representing LA county, called the statement “fair and reasonable” adding: “We hope Ms Bryant and her children continue to heal from their loss.”
