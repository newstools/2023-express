There’s nothing that looks more flattering than smooth, shiny hair that’s frizz free. And Amazon shoppers are loving a new hair tool that’s helping them achieve silky hair, without a hefty price. Hair straighteners are one of the most versatile styling tools for creating smooth, stylish looks. Straighteners can be very pricy with GHD being about £130 in price, but shoppers have found an amazing discount that saves 50 percent off an incredible tool. Available now, the Panasonic Enrich + Advanced Care Hair Straightener is now on offer for only £99.99 on Amazon, saving £100 off its usual price. Delivering flawless style with plates that evenly distribute heat, it’s an amazing bargain that’s just in time for Mother’s Day. The new hair tool from Panasonic features high-speed intelligent thermal sensors and 3D flexible floating plates. It takes only one stroke to style hair and it’s also enriched with technology that draws moisture from the air to prevent any dryness. With five temperature settings ranging from 150 to 230 degrees Celsius, Panasonic has found that 75 percent of women agree that it has a noticeably smoother glide. Taking only 20 seconds to heat up and praised by shoppers for being super ‘easy to use’, it’s an excellent addition to any styling routine and makes a great Mother’s Day present. Shoppers love that it works on thick, wavy and curly hair.
