It's just a week to go before the second round of the Formula One championship roars into life in Saudi Arabia. Red Bull have the advantage after the first race as Max Verstappen and Sergio Perez dominated proceedings in Bahrain. However, a lot's happening off-track in the break with three-time champion Nelson Piquet reportedly set to be fined for making racist comments about Lewis Hamilton. O Globo has claimed the Brazilian could be hit with a £1.6milion penalty after using the N-word to describe Hamilton back in 2021. Piquet publicly denied any wrongdoing and denied there was any racist intent behind the comments. Meanwhile, Red Bull boss Helmut Marko has written off the Silver Arrows after their new concept failed at Sakhir. Helmut Marko has suggested the German manufacturer have “lost their way” and had taken a “step backwards” over the winter. But, Red Bull team principal Christian Horner still lists Mercedes as a potential threat for 2023 once they get on top of their design flaws.
