Callous thieves stole a soldier's "irreplaceable" collection of medals in a heartless burglary. The crooks snatched the medals along with "other items of value" on Saturday at an address in Wrexham, north Wales. Police have launched an appeal to find the six medals, and have shared a photograph of them. The soldier served in the Royal Welch Fusiliers, which was a line infantry regiment of the British Army active until 2006. Officers at North Wales Police have also asked people to check their CCTV and dashcam footage. The medals include the long service and good conduct accolade, reports North Wales Live. Inspector Luke Hughes, of the Wrexham City policing team for North Wales Constabulary, said: "Please make these 'too hot to handle'. "The medals in order are from left Northern Ireland medal, Bosnia medal, Iraq medal, Queens Jubilee medal, long service and good conduct medal and Accumulated service medal. "Should you have any info please contact and quote A032252."  Royal Welch Fusiliers, founded in 1689, eventually merged with the Royal Regiment of Wales to form a new large regiment, the Royal Welsh. But in its heydey, Royal Welch Fusiliers was deployed in World War Two. It then performed several tours in Northern Ireland (Operation Banner) and was deployed to the Balkans. Last year, a Second World War hero was robbed of his medals, jewellery and thousands of pounds in cash after conmen tricked their way into his home in Ealing, west London. Jan Stangryciuk, aged 100, was targeted by three men claiming to be from a water company. The veteran and his elderly wife were distracted by one of the heartless thieves as the others went in search of valuables.
