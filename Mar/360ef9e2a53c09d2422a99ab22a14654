The new "Premium Meal Deal" will sit alongside its standard £3.40 meal deal in shops and include a wider variety of items including meals from brands such as YO! Sushi, Pollen and Grace, and Itsu. Tesco’s Chief Customer Officer, Alessandra Bellini, said: “We know our Tesco Meal Deal is hugely popular with our customers, and is a lunchtime staple for millions of people day in, day out. “But sometimes you want to treat yourself to something a little special, and the new Premium Meal Deal gives our shoppers the opportunity to upgrade their usual lunch choices. What’s more, at only £5 for the full meal, Clubcard members really can enjoy gourmet on the go.” Since announcing the new product, customers have unleashed a wave of ire over the new more expensive lunchtime option READ MORE: Tesco now offering affordable at-home health kit that tests for cancer One person wrote on Twitter: “No thanks @Tesco, there’s a cost of living crisis going on the moment [sic].” Some said they could see themselves being priced out of meal deals whilst another wrote that the new premium product “doesn’t bang enough for it to be £5. No meal deal should be that much.” A spokesperson for Tesco told the Daily Star: “The Premium Meal Deal option has been added to the Tesco offering to make even more options available for customers, and particularly those who do want to upgrade their Meal Deal.” The new meal deal is currently available in 1,200 stores around the country. This isn’t the first time Tesco and other supermarkets have come under pressure this year. In recent weeks, they have had to ration fruit and vegetables as environmental and political factors affect supply to the United Kingdom. Tesco is one of the supermarkets which has had to introduce rationing on some items as the shortages begin to bite. It is hoped these will ease as the weather and supply of these basic necessities improve.
