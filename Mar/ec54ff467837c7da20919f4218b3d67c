Lady Gaga looked sensational at the Oscars at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles yesterday. The pop star, 36, and Irish actor Brendan Gleeson, 67, star together in Folie à Deux and filming for the highly anticipated Joker sequel is currently underway. Lady Gaga is set to star as queen of chaos Harley Quinn in Todd Phillips’ Joker, which will see the return of Joaquin Phoenix’s Arthur Fleck in the title role. Brendan was nominated for Best Supporting Actor for The Banshees of Inisherin, but sadly lost out to Ke Huy Quan for Everything Everywhere All At Once. Lady Gaga stunned as she arrived in a risque sheer black Versace gown with a bralette top and low-slung skirt. The pop star completed the look with a diamond choker, bracelet up and a bright orange-red lip. She later removed her make-up to give a raw performance at the 95th Academy Awards.
