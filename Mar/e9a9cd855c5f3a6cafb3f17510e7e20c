Project Wolf Hunting is a brash, darkly funny and gut-wrenchingly violent B-movie that doesnâ€™t take its foot off your throat for a second. The setting is a 58,000-ton cargo ship travelling between the Philippines and South Korea.  For the first half hour, it seems most of the action will involve the dirty dozen or so Korean murderers, serial killers and rapists who are being transported back to their home nation under an extradition treaty. But, unbeknown to the cops, crew and criminals on board, something even more sinister is lurking in the engine room. Flashbacks reveal a secret Japanese experiment conducted during the occupation of Korea. And this dark secret will come back to torment the passengers in increasingly gruesome ways.  What begins as a Korean Con-Air will turn into a K-movie Alien as a monster goes on the rampage, limbs are torn off and heads are crushed like melons. When the violence becomes repetitive, we get another twist, a conspiracy and the emergence of a surprise hero. After two breakneck hours, viewers with strong stomachs will be left wanting more.
