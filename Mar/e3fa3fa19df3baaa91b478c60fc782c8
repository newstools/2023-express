Sky Sports Soccer Saturday host Jeff Stelling left fans and fellow pundits in stitches with his joke following the news that Gary Lineker was forced to step back from hosting Match of the Day. The BBC man will not host Saturday's programme after refusing to apologise for his tweet criticising the government's new asylum policy. Stelling has previously shown his support alongside the footballing community and wider that has backed Lineker for standing up for his beliefs, though could not resist cracking a joke live on air. "I need to be at the top of my game today because there's a top-notch football presenter available on Saturdays now," Stelling said as his remark was met with a chorus of laughs in the studio. Social media users also enjoyed his comment, joking that Lineker could take his job. One viewer praised Stelling and labelled him a "legend" for the joke. "The legend that is Jeff Stelling," @WReallfriends said. While @samgoldman91 added: "Jeff Stellingâ€™s opening line as perfect as expected on Soccer Saturday."
