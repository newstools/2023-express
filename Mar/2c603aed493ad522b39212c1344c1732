When announcing that their daughter had been christened, the couple’s spokesperson referred to her as Princess Lilibet Diana - revealing that their children will be taking on their birthright titles. It comes after six months of speculation on the matter as Archie and Lilibet automatically become prince and princess when Charles acceded the throne.  But until today no indication had been given on whether they would take up the titles. The Palace had been waiting for Harry and Meghan to decide, while the Sussexes were dismayed that the titles had not been immediately changed on the Royal Family’s website - like the Prince and Princess of Wales’s had. But the decision reflects a significant development in the ongoing drama between the Sussexes and the rest of the Firm, as it suggests Harry is cementing his children’s royal futures and ensuring that they have close links with their paternal family. Archie has only met Harry’s side of the family a handful of times, while the King only met Lilibet for the first time last June, when the couple returned for the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee.  His decision for his children to take the titles is hugely significant, as it symbolises Harry’s desire for him and his family to remain formally tied to the institution despite the 5,000 miles between them. It would have been easy for the couple to raise their children as entirely separate to the Royal Family, but their decision to formalise their ties suggests they will be returning to the fold in the future, and the Coronation is the perfect place to start. Channels of communication between Harry and his family appear to be improving, and only time will tell if the shift will develop into a more formal reconciliation.
