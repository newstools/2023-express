This week’s episode of Queen The Greatest Live takes fans back over 40 years ago, as the official YouTube documentary series continues to explore the band’s epic opening numbers. In new interviews from previous weeks, both Sir Brian May and Roger Taylor shared how the combination of building anticipation in an audience and then striking them with a spectacular first song is vital for a Queen show. Today’s video perfectly shows this when the band performed at the Milton Keynes Bowl on June 5, 1982.  Freddie Mercury and the boys blasted off with a blazing medley of Flash and The Hero, much to the delight of the Queen fans present. Sir Brian penned the tracks for the 1980 Flash Gordon movie, the first of the band’s hugely successful soundtrack work. This Milton Keynes concert was one of four massive outdoor shows on the UK leg of Queen’s 1982 Hot Space Tour. The scale of this grandiose production was underlined after plans for a Royal Albert Hall concert were abandoned due to fears the iconic domed ceiling would collapse under the weight of the lighting rig.

The Milton Keynes show took place on a perfect summer’s day; a rare opportunity for the band. Freddie told the audience during the performance: “It’s not very often we do shows in the daylight. I f***ing wish we had before – I can see you all now! And there’s some beauties here tonight…” Next week’s episode of Queen the Greatest Live is called One Vision.
