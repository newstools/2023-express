"They only posted the appeal an hour before the girls were found. We found them before the police found them - we rang the police. "The search party found the girls before the police found the girls. "I think that speaks volumes really, they had all that equipment, and we had cars when we were looking.  "They were really popular girls, the life of the party, and it was really out of character for them to do what they did, which is why we knew something was wrong." Tributes have been paid on social media to those who died. A friend of Mr Loughlin posted: "I'm so proud of us all pulling together out there searching for our dear friends last night. "It's heart breaking what's happened to Rafel Jeanne and those two girls. My body is still shaking and I can't stop being sick the thought of them all there all of that time. "Many times I have driven past, it just makes me so sad and to how helpless our Shane Loughlin must of felt trapped inside. "Wish Sophie a speedy recovery and I send all my love and strength to all the families involved."
