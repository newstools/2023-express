Pierce Brosnan made time to snap a few selfies with some fans passing by and stayed in the Salthouse Hotel in Ballycastle. The 007 actor was shooting scenes for his new movie Four Letters Of Love in County Antrim, Northern Ireland on Tuesday. The film, based on the best-selling novel by Niall Williams, is currently filming in the town of Ballycastle, with the production drawing crowds of locals as the actors got to work. The 69-year-old looked noticeably different as he sported long grey hair and teamed his attire with a teal jumper and a grey jacket.
