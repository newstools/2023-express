NFL Draft prospect Andrew Vorhees is likely to have lost millions after cruelly rupturing his ACL while impressing scouts at the combine. Vorhees is seen as one of the better offensive line prospects in this year's class and is coming off the back of an impressive years with the USC Trojans, having been projected to be selected in the second round. But the serious knee injury will almost certainly see him miss his rookie year, which could also mean that he slips several rounds in the draft - potentially not even being drafted. This would cost the lineman millions, with the players being selected higher earning much more guaranteed money - potentially going from $10million to around $300k. But in an incredible showing of strength, and heart, Vorhees somehow then managed to bench press with just one leg on the ground after rupturing his ACL, with 38 reps out 225 lbs - the highest amount of reps since 2012. Vorhees was an accomplished starter with USC, being apart of one of the better offensive lines in college football and blocked for Heisman Trophy winner Caleb Williams - who is expected to be drafted #1 overall in the 2024 draft. The offensive guard put together an impressive day at the combine, weighing in at 310lbs, while standing at 6'6. Vorhees had even been reported as potentially being a late first-round pick - a rarity for a guard. But sadly, injuries have been apart of his career to this date, missing time in 2018 and 2019 with two surgeries. Vorhees made 37 starts in his USC career, and will now hope to prove to a team he's worthy of a high pick before returning in 2024.
