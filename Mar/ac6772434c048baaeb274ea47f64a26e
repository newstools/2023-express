An American Airlines scheduled flight from New York to London has declared a general emergency and is presently on diversion to Manchester. The aircraft was nearing its destination of London Heathrow, before initiating the diversion to Manchester due to delays at London Heathrow caused by wind. The plane was reportedly running low on fuel. American Airlines Flight AA104 operated by a Boeing 777-300ER, registered N721AN was on a scheduled flight from New York JFK International Airport (JFK) to London Heathrow (LHR). The aircraft was nearing its destination of London Heathrow, before initiating the diversion to Manchester. According to latest flight tracking data, Flight AA104 is currently descending from 1,000 feet on approach to Manchester Airport. It comes days after A Jet2 flight had to divert to Manchester Airport, where it was met by emergency crews. The flight from London Stansted to Antalya, Turkey took off as expected earlier today (March 9), but it had to be diverted to Manchester due to a "minor fault indication". Clips from an aviation live stream on YouTube showed multiple fire engines behind the aircraft after it landed at Manchester. A Jet2 spokesperson said the flight landed safely. The emergency crews appeared to taxi the plane down the runway after it landed. Passengers were transferred onto another plane to complete the journey to Turkey. The Jet2 statement said: "A Flight LS1465 from London Stansted to Antalya followed procedure and diverted to Manchester Airport this morning, due to a minor fault indication. "The aircraft landed safely, and customers will be transferred onto a standby aircraft so that we can get them on their way to Antalya as soon as possible. We apologise to everyone onboard for any inconvenience caused."
