A 19-year-old 'English' teenager was beaten over the head with a stone before being raped near a nightclub in Barcelona, Spanish media reports have claimed. The shocked young woman was taken to hospital after being found on the street near the venue, known as Input, with a head wound and cuts and bruises to her knees. Security guards are understood to have triggered the alarm at 5am on Saturday morning - an hour after she left the nightclub. She apparently told them she had been hit over the head with a stone before being subjected to a serious sexual assault. She was described in some reports as "English" and by others as "Anglo-Saxon". However, Catalan Police have yet to reveal her nationality. They are believed to be searching for two men seen on CCTV. No arrests have yet been made but police have obtained DNA evidence which they are using for the investigation. Input is located near the Romanesque monastery of San Miguel at the eastern end of Barcelona's Poble Espanyol attraction. International DJs regularly perform sets on Friday and Saturday nights. The Poble Espanyol, built for the 1929 World Fair in Barcelona, is an open-air architectural museum close to the Fountains of Montjuic. It consists of 117 full-scale buildings replicated from different places in Spain, and also contains a theatre, restaurants, artisan workshop and a contemporary art museum. Brazilian international Dani Alves is still being held in prison on remand on suspicion of sexually attacking a woman at Sutton nightclub in Barcelona late last year. His bid to be released on bail ahead of trial, with strict conditions including wearing an electronic tag and handing in his passport, was turned down by judges last month. Express.co.uk has contacted Catalan police force Mossos d’Esquadra for further details. (More to follow)
