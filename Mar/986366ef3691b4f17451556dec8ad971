Dancing on Ice returned to ITV for the grand final and Joey Essex, Nile Wilson and The Vivienne took to the ice for the last time. They each danced a solo performance with their partners before taking part in a battle-style routine. After which, Brendan Cole and Regan Gascoigne took to the ice for a short segment. Hosts Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield introduced the pair as they came out to perform some tricks. However, viewers were quick to spot a filming error as just seconds before they emerged from backstage, they were seen in the audience behind the hosts. Fans took to Twitter to expose the blunder, stressing how the final could not be called "live". Sara Sutton said: "The magic of live shows, Brendan & Regan in two places at once #DancingOnIce #DancingOnIce."

Lee Doherty said: "Of all the priceless c**k-up's that this show could deliver, trying to mesh pre-recorded footage with live coverage, was just now with Brendan Cole being introduced on the ice .... while he was sat in the audience behind Holly & Phil! #DancingOnIce #CarCrashTV #ITVGoneToHell." Sofie added: "Brendan and [Regan] in the audience literally a second before they came out of the tunnel, thought @dancingonicewas live #fail #dancingonice #oops."
