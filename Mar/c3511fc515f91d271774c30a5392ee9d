Boxing's heavyweight division may have the unification fight it's been craving after Oleksandr Usyk accepted Tyson Fury's latest terms for a showdown this year. Fury, 34, posted a video on Instagram earlier on Friday offering Usyk 30 per cent of the prize purse from their fight. However, 'The Gypsy King added the caveat that the figure would fall by one per cent for every day his target 'lingered or messed around'. Eager to ensure that number didn't fall below the maximum, Usyk put out his own video in response to the message and said he 'accepts the offer' to fight for a 70-30 split at Wembley on April 29. However, the Ukrainian added a condition for Fury to contribute to Ukrainian aid in its war against invading Russia. "You will promise to donate [Â£1million to Ukraine immediately after the fight]," said Usyk in a Twitter video addressed to 'greedy belly'. The 36-year-old went on to issue an ultimatum of his own and, challenging Fury to donate one per cent of his purse to Ukraine's appeal for every day that he delayed an agreement.
