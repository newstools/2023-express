Kim Basinger, 69, looked better than ever as she smiled for the paparazzi when she left the Hollywood strip club following her daughter Ireland Baldwin's baby shower. The Oscar-winning actress looked great in a casual silver two-piece trouser suit, teamed with a black blouse and matching shoes. Kim was accompanied by her longtime hairstylist boyfriend Mitch Stone. Not seen at the event was Ireland's father Alec Baldwin, 64, or his current wife Hilaria, 39, with whom he has seven children. Ireland posted a string of festive Instagram pictures from the party, surprisingly located at the strip club, including a couple of her cuddling up to Kim over the cake.
