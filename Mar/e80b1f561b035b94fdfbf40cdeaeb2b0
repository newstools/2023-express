Hunter Schafer put on a jaw-dropping display as the on-screen star posed for photos on the red carpet at Vanity Fair's Oscar Party in Beverly Hills, California on Sunday. The 24-year-old dared to bare all in her brave attire that included a feather bandeau top and a pearlescent silk skirt as the actress flashed the flesh. The trans star boosted her height with strappy heels and wore her blonde tresses out and relaxed. She kept her make up light with a smokey eye adding a light blush to accentuate her cheekbones.
