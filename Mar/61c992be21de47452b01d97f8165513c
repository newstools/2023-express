A friend of the girls involved in a car crash after a night out which left three dead has questioned why it took the police so long to find them. The bodies of Eve Smith, 21, Darcy Ross, 21, and Rafel Jeanne, 24, were found in the wreckage of a white VW Tiguan in the St Mellons area of Cardiff on Monday morning â€“ 46 hours after they were last seen. Sophie Russon, 20, and Shane Loughlin, 32, were found alive, but spent two days critically injured next to their friends. Tamzin Samuels, a friend of the girls, said: "I do think the police could have done a lot more in putting the helicopters out earlier. "They only posted the appeal an hour before the girls were found. We found them before the police found them - we rang the police." Ms Samuels, 20, said: "The search party found the girls before the police found the girls." Ms Samuels added: "I think that speaks volumes really, they had all that equipment, and we had cars when we were looking. "They were really popular girls, the life of the party, and it was really out of character for them to do what they did, which is why we knew something was wrong." There are also reports the site of the crash was identified by helicopter. It comes after the mother of one of those who went undiscovered for almost two days claimed the police told her to stop ringing and the group was probably hungover somewhere. Gwent Police said: "We understand how distressing it is when a loved one goes missing. We are aware of media reports regarding this, and we will be liaising closely with the families involved to find out more information and address any concerns of this nature." Meanwhile, tributes continue to be paid on social media, including from Eve's heartbroken sister, who wrote a moving message about her on Facebook.

"I know you're safe up with there with our beautiful sister Xana but I was never ready to let you go, my body is aching without you." A friend of Eve and Darcy wrote: "I don't really have the words right now. "Darcy Ross I'm going to miss you little gypsy girl. You were one of a kind, I'm going to miss trying to 'life coach' you as you would've said. You were a real ray of sunshine especially on my bad days. "Eve Smith you were truly a beautiful young girl, who's heart was made of gold just like your sister's, give her a big hug for me and hold each other tight until the day we all have our turn and reunite."
