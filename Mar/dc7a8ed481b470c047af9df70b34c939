Denise Fox (played by Diane Parish) almost gave in to temptation in EastEnders when she met Ravi Gulati (Aaron Thiara) at a hotel but stopped their flirtationship from going any further at the last minute. This isn't the end of their story, however, as Callum Highway (Tony Clay) saw she was meeting Ravi that night while scrolling through CCTV footage. Meanwhile, Patrick Trueman (Rudolph Walker) has been spending quality time with Vi Highway (Gwen Taylor) but will soon have to say goodbye to his newest friend. WARNING: This article contains spoilers from EastEnders. Patrick Trueman first arrived in Walford way back in 2001 when he was attending his ex-wife Audrey Trueman's funeral. He reunited with his sons Paul (Gary Beadle) and Anthony Trueman (Nicholas Bailey) after decades away and eventually, the brothers accepted him. It later comes out that while Anthony is his biological son, Paul is the son of Patrick's best friend Milton Hibbert (Jeffery Kissoon). Nevertheless, they stay close and when Paul is later on killed, having got involved with dealing drugs, Patrick is left devastated and still to this day refers to him as his son.

They take a DNA test and while Patrick knows he isn't Denise's dad, he pretends to be as he has grown very attached to her and her children, Chelsea (Zaraah Abrahams) and Libby Fox (Belinda Owusu). The truth does come out and Denise is mad for a little while but does forgive him, having loved having a father-figure in her life. Kim Fox (Tameka Empson), Denise's half-sister is later introduced in 2009 and Patrick acts like a dad to her as well. Denise and Kim had always believed they were half-sisters, sharing the same mum, Emerald Fox (Do√±a Croll). She dropped a bombshell in 2018, claiming they weren't biologically related at all but thankfully, a DNA test proved otherwise. Denise is the mum of Chelsea, whose dad is serial killer Lucas Johnson (Don Gilet), and Libby, whose father was Owen Turner (Lee Ross). Whereas Kim is the mum of youngsters Pearl and Mica Fox, who she had with deceased husband Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood). Don't miss...
