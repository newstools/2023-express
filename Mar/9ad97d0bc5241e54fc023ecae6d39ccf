Over the past few weeks, Coronation Street viewers have seen friction between child Hope Stape (played by Isabelle Flanagan) and Beth Tinker (Lisa George) following the death of Cilla the Chinchilla after Peanut the dog killed her. However, as anger and frustrations grew, Beth took things a step too far and slapped the child for her behaviour. After Peanut killed Hope’s beloved new pet Cilla, the devious child took matters into her own hands and lied about Beth’s dog biting her to avenge her Chinchilla.Furious at her lies, the two argued in the street as Hope returned home to tell her mum Fiz (Jennie McAlpine) and Tyronne (Alan Halsall) that Beth had slapped her around the face.Although due to the child not usually telling the truth, Beth denied the allegations and strongly told them she’d never do such a thing.As Hope was furious her mum was sweeping her claims under the carpet, she stormed out of the house, with Beth following her and the truth being revealed that she did in fact smack her. Apologising for striking her, Beth offered her unlimited hugs with her dog, although Hope managed to get money out of her to keep quiet.However, she later confided in friend Sam Blakeman (Jude Riordan) that Beth slapped her and he decided to tell Tyrone that Hope was telling the truth.In scenes set to air next week, Fiz and Tyrone decide to have a romantic lunch at home where they’re shocked to find Hope at home after skipping school.As Fiz steps towards her daughter, Hope flinches and begs her mum not to hit her leaving her stunned at the thought. Realising Hope was telling the truth all along, they confront Beth for smacking their child and then lying about it.Despite Beth writing an apology letter to Hope, which she gives Fiz to pass on, it looks as though her partner Kirk can’t get past her striking a child.Questioning his relationship with Beth, she’s devastated and confides in Kirk’s sister Maria (Samia Longchambon) for advice.Listening to her tips, Beth sets out to try and remind Kirk she’s a good person underneath.

Although Coronation Street viewers have seen Hope’s more evil side over the years, boss Iain MacLeod revealed they’re going to take her in a different direction over the year. Speaking on ITV’s Loose Women, he said: “She’s certainly not going to continue down such a troubled path.“We thought actually we’ve done some very dark and twisted things with that character, and okay, that will still be part of her, but for the next 12 months, we’re going to do normal pre-teen stuff.“We’re going to be building a friendship with her and Sam that will verge on a very innocent pre-teen romance a little bit and they try to navigate those waters.“It will always have a Hope twist on it because she’s maybe wired a bit differently than most kids her age... but we’ll see a more down-to-earth grounded side of her.”
