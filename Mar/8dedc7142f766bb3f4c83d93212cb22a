After making its debut back in 2012, the long-running crime show has followed Fred Thursday and Endeavour Morse (played by Shaun Evans) solve a number of bleak murder investigations over the past 10 years. However, the ninth series of the ITV show will be the last as actor Roger Allam touched on Fred Thursday’s future. The first episode of the latest series kicked off last Sunday which saw Shaun Evans and Roger Allem reprise their roles in the ITV crime drama for the very last time.Titled Prelude, the two-hour special took audiences into the early 1970s as the two detectives were thrown into solving the murder of a man who was found in a college garden.During the episode, Fred was offered a job promotion by Chief Superintendent Reginald Bright (Anton Lesser) which would involve having to move away from his current location.With only two more instalments left in the final series, viewers will likely see the long-running character depart Oxford, leaving his crime-solving partner behind.
