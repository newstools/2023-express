A massive rescue mission is underway in Sussex as helicopters and lifeboats make their way into the Shoreham sea. A video that has surfaced online shows a  team of the local coastguard reaching the spot as the rescue mission is launched.      While there has been no official communication from the police, social media users stayed awake to observe the development. According to the reports, two air ambulances were spotted in the area as the police continued the rescue operation. A social media user @sfjlobe_8 commented: “I have been keeping track too. “A second air ambulance has gone in now to search.    “The first, returning to base.” At around 1.15 am, another user @beadsonstalks commented: “The second Coastguard search and rescue helicopter, dispatched from Lydd, Kent, has been out there conducting sweeps for about the last hour or so now.” READ MORE: SNP MP told to apologise over ‘ignorant racial slur'
