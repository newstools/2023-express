Pensioners' need for social care has hit a new peak yet the number of ­people actually being helped is plunging – putting the burden on families. There were almost two million requests for support from England’s frail elderly or other vulnerable ­people in 2021-22. But those receiving long-term care fell to 818,000 in 2021-22 – a massive 55,000 drop from 2015-16.  Older people have been worst affected with numbers receiving ­long-term care down to 529,000 in 2021-22 – a fall of 23,000 in just one year. This is because cash-strapped councils are turning them down, according to the latest report – Social Care 360 – from think-tank The King’s Fund. Requests for adult social care have been steadily rising since 2015 but then sharply fell in 2020-21, reflecting a reluctance for people to come ­forward for services in the pandemic. But they have now bounced back to an all-time high. The number of new requests for support increased from 1.92 million adults in 2020-21 to 1.98 million in 2021-22. Increasing illness and ­disability among working-age adults pushed up requests for help from 578,000 in 2020-21 to 612,000 in 2021-22 – 5.8 percent rise.  And requests from people aged 65-plus rose from 1.34 million in 2020-21 to 1.37 million in 2021-22 (2.2 percent). The cost of a care home place is also soaring, the report found. The average weekly bill paid by local authorities in England for care homes places for working-age adults rose by 2.5 percent, to £1,428 in 2021-22. The average weekly fee for older people’s care home places increased 2.6 percent to £767. Simon Bottery, senior fellow at The King’s Fund and lead author of the report, said: ‘It’s likely that local authorities will see the number of new requests for adult social care pass the two million mark for the first time this year. “However, on current trends, fewer people will end up receiving ­long- term support. That means that more people will have to pay ­themselves, rely on family and friends – or go without care entirely.”  Staff vacancies in the social care sector are also now the highest since records began, the report found. Between 2020-21 and 2021-22, the number of vacancies in adult social care rose from 110,000 to 165,000. Mr Bottery added: “The report shows many of the critical indicators for adult social care are going in the wrong direction. “Yet the Government’s main reforms, such as the introduction of a cap on lifetime care costs, have now been postponed until 2025.”  What is happening where you live?
