Micah Richards was left expressionless and speechless after being cheekily mocked by Kate Abdo while covering Bayern Munich's Champions League tie against Paris Saint-Germain. Richards was working as a pundit alongside Thierry Henry and Jamie Carragher on CBS Sports' coverage of Wednesday night's Champions League games, as the host made a cheeky remark about International Women's Day. When welcoming viewers to the show, Abdo quipped: "A very happy International Women's Day everyone, welcome to our London studio on this massive Champions League Wednesday. "I'm Kate Abdo and for those soap opera lovers on the East Coast who have just been watching the Bold and the Beautiful, don't worry, we have more bold and beautiful for you right here... we've also got Micah Richards here." The former Manchester City man didn't see the bright side of the joke at first, however, as he sat stern-faced staring back at Abdo before replying: "Really Kate? Really?" Henry joked: "It's starting well!" Before Abdo quipped: "Come on, man, that's what we do!" Richards went on to speak to AC Milan star Olivier Giroud after the Italian side knocked Tottenham out to reach the quarter-finals, and the French striker referenced the fact Richards spends Â£503 ($600) per week on getting his hair cut. Asked by Abdo how much he spends on getting his hair cut, Giroud joked: "[I don't spend] that much, not that much! Micah, come on!"
