Brooklyn Beckham, who will celebrate his 24th birthday tomorrow, has jetted in all the way from the USA, where he now lives with Nicola. Ever since the loved-up pair tied the knot almost a year ago, they have been dogged by rumours that Nicola and Victoria are at loggerheads - something which the couple have always firmly denied. Speculation was fuelled by Nicola's decision to wear a Valentino wedding dress, instead of opting for a Victoria Beckham creation, on her special day. However, Nicola was beaming with excitement this afternoon as she held hands with her beau in Paris on the way to her mother-in-law's eagerly anticipated show. Brooklyn's dad David Beckham has also been spotted on the way to the 5:30pm show, hand-in-hand with his youngest daughter, Harper.
