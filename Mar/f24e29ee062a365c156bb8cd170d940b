Mourners have been asked to wear pink at the funeral of a teenager who was stabbed in a park. Brianna Ghey, 16, was found with multiple stab woundsÂ on a path in a park in Warrington, Cheshire. A date for the "much-loved daughter, granddaughter and baby sister" funeral has been set - Wednesday March 15 - while two teenagers await trial. Brianna's family says mourners should wear "pink and colourful" at the ceremony to match the trans teenager's personality. On a fundraiser page, the family said: "She was a larger-than-life character who would leave a lasting impression on all that met her. Brianna was beautiful, witty and hilarious. Brianna was strong, fearless and one of a kind. "The loss of her young life has left a massive hole in our family, and we know that the teachers and her friends who were involved in her life will feel the same. We would like to thank everyone for their kind words and support during this extremely difficult time." The funeral will take place at a church in Warrington, reports Liverpool Echo. On the day she died, Brianna had spoken to her mum and a video was posted to her TikTok account only hours before she was killed. The teenager was found dead by members of the public. Two teenagers - a boy and a girl, both aged 15 - are accused of Brianna's murder and will stand trial on July 10. The girl, from Warrington, and the boy, of Leigh, Greater Manchester, were charged four days after the death and initially appeared at Chester Magistrates Court. Vigils were held across the country in the days after the teen's death last month. One ceremony took place outside the Department for Education's building in Whitehall while events were also staged in Lancaster, Liverpool, Bristol, Belfast and Dublin.
