The Duke declared: "My wife saved me, I was stuck in this world and she was from a different world and helped draw me out of that."

You have got to start with change within yourself." Speaking about Meghan, he said: "My partner is an exceptional human being and I am eternally grateful [for her]." Harry's latest interview saw him delve deep into his childhood trauma, his years of therapy and his desire to break free from the Royal Family.

Harry said: "It leaves me in the position of a father having two children trying to smother them with love "I feel a huge responsibility not to pass on any trauma or negative experiences that I've had as a kid or as a man growing up. "There are times when I catch myself when I should smothering them with that love but I might not be." He added that if he did not hug his own children it would have a "similar" impact on them as he experienced growing up - something he is actively trying to prevent.
