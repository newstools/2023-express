After celebrating award-winning cinema, 95th Academy Awards attendees and fellow Hollywood stars were ready to party the night away at the prestigious 2023 Vanity Fair post-Oscars bash. Model Emily Ratajkowski, 31, Desperate Housewives favourite Eva Longoria, 47, and Game of Thrones star Sophie Turner, 27, all embraced the sheer trend to highlight their enviable gym-honed figures to full effect. The annual party with a very exclusive guest list kicked off at the Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts in Beverly Hills. Many stars who had attended the ceremony embraced the opportunity for a wardrobe change before continuing the Hollywood festivities. Emily put on an eye-popping display as she went braless and flashed her underwear for the night out, while Eva, who had presented an Oscar earlier in the evening, put on an equally daring display as she unveiled her legs and pert derriere.
