Tragedy has struck a Welsh farming community after a father was killed and his sun severely injured in a freak accident on their farm in Aberhosan, near Machynlleth, Powys. A steel silo holding grain suddenly collapsed onto the pair while they were working together.  The father, Iwan Evans, died as a result of his injuries, while his son, Dafydd, was airlifted to Royal Stoke University Hospital with severe injuries. A lorry had been delivering animal feed for a free-standing silo in the farm's sheep stable when Iwan was thrown to the ground face down when the entire store and its contents erupted onto the father and son. The deliveryman tried in vain to remove the feed bin from the pair using farm vehicles and chains. He also ran a short distance to the farmhouse to notify Mrs Evans, who then the emergency services. The incident was not treated as suspicious by the police, but the Health and Safety Executive are investigating. Machynlleth Male Voice Choir, where Dafydd was a popular member, cancelled their concert as a mark of respect following the tragedy.  Don't miss...
