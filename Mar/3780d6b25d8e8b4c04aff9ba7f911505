Prince Harry revealed what it was like growing up inside a "castle" as he sat down for his latest interview. The 38-year-old sat down with Dr Gabor Maté, in an undisclosed location, to discuss the importance of healing and living life after having experienced a loss. Harry's guest has caused some public fury, due to some "inappropriate" comments made by Mr Maté, including one in which he labelled Hamas rockets as "heroes".  The virtual event was held on Saturday, March 4, and was hosted by Penguin Random House as tickets sold out. In the final question of the session, Harry was asked whether he had been able to roam castles as a child and whether he found any trapdoors. He said: "Certainly as kids it was an an adventure running around that kind of a place. Not so many trapdoors but lots of fun things to investigate. "You think that it's normal but it's anything but." "If Prince Harry knew this man's record and still chose him for the interview, our Centre would criticise the prince for such an inappropriate choice." Upon purchasing tickets, fans were able to submit questions for Prince Harry to potentially answer during the Q&A segment of the event. The terms and conditions for the event stated that the "chat will be disabled".
