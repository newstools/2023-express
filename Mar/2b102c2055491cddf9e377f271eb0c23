A taxi driver has shared his fury after receiving a £60 parking fine - despite only being outside a McDonald's branch for 47 seconds. Kam Parvez had gone to the Trent Vale branch to pick up a customer when he got the fine. Speaking to Stoke-on-Trent Live, the 33-year-old says he was stunned to be slapped with the parking penalty. It was handed out after the car park operator claimed Kam had parked on yellow 'keep clear' markings near the entrance to the McDonald's car park. Now Kam, from Meir Park, Stoke-on-Trent, has managed to overturn the penalty after winning a second appeal. He was able to prove that he had never parked on the 'keep clear' markings as suggested by the company. He said: "I was in there for 47 seconds, including the U-turn and including loading the customer into the vehicle. I was parked outside of the restricted area. The customer was already waiting on the roadside. "They rejected my appeal and included a site map. In there, the area has a red line which goes all the way to the entrance of McDonald's. It's bigger than the area they've marked out on the road. I want the public to know.  "They told me it was because I had entered the marked area and I had parked there. But I wasn't parked within the 'keep clear' area, I parked out of that area." McDonald's has declined to comment as the incident did not take place on its land. Stoke-on-Trent Live and Express.co.uk have contacted iPark Services for a statement regarding the overturned fine. And when dad Marcus Ward and his wife took their two young children for lunch at a McDonald's in Coventry, West Midlands, he received a £50 fine through the letterbox days later. He had exceeded the time limit by 10 minutes, it emerged.
