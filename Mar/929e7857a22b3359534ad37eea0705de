Part of the M5 was closed in both directions today due to a crash incolving a tipper truck. The vehicle collided with an overhead gantry on the motorway near junction 17 for Cribbs Causeway, South Gloucestershire and junction 18 for the M49. Both sides of the road were shut and diversions were in place between the stretch, reports Bristol Live. Queues southbound were back to junction 16 for Patchway, South Gloucestershire while northbound jams reached junction 19 for Portbury, Somerset. Traffic monitoring service Inrix said: "M5 in both directions closed, queueing traffic due to accident from J17 A4018 (Cribbs Causeway) to J18 M49. "Cameras show traffic is being forced off the motorway in both directions." Photographs show the tipper truck wedged vertically between the overhead gantry and the carriageway. Traffic can be seen stopped behind it. Ray Morwood, South West Operations Manager for National Highways, said: "The M5 has been closed to protect the travelling public and we’re working as quickly as we can to assess the gantry damage and make safe the signage and fittings. "The incident has occurred on a busy section of the M5, we are working with our police partners, and we appreciate this will cause significant delays to people’s journeys. "In the meantime, we advise people to add a little extra time for their journeys, and to consider alternative routes where they can. We thank all drivers for their co-operation and patience and we’re working quickly to establish timescales for repair and recovery work." Diversions took drivers along local roads through parts of Bristol, including Lawrence Weston, Hallen and Henbury. These roads and the M49 were busy as a result of the smash. Kings Weston Road and Long Cross were particularly congested in the southwest Bristol area.
