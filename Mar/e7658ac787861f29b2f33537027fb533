This gold collar set, made for an aristocratic family with links to the victor of Waterloo, to Queen Victoria, Sir Winston Churchill and Diana, Princess of Wales is on public sale for the first time.  The locket-adorned Spencer-Churchill necklace is being sold for £125,000 at Mayfair jewellers Hancocks. Guy Burton, its managing director, said the Spencer-Churchills were “at the very heart of British society and politics” for two centuries. “This piece, and the names it carries, reflect their status and influence in a way almost no other family dynasty could match.” The necklace was made around 1875 for John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough, as a gift for his wife Frances. She was a childhood friend of Victoria and god-daughter of Waterloo hero Arthur Wellesley, the 1st Duke of Wellington. The pair’s son Randolph Churchill was the Tory politician and father of Second World War leader Winston. Mr Burton added: “As the Spencer-Churchill family are related to the Spencer family of Althorp, the necklace also links the late Diana, Princess of Wales.”
