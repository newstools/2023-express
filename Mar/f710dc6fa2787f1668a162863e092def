Don't fancy splashing out over £800 on a new Galaxy S23? Don't panic as Motorola may have the answer. This famous smartphone firm has just released a batch of Android-powered devices that offer some very premium features for a ludicrously low price. In fact, the cheapest of the bunch, called the moto e13, can be popped in pockets for under £90 which sounds like a bit of a bargain. For that low price, owners will be treated to a device with a 6.5-inch HD+ display and a massive 5000mAh battery. There's also an octa-core processor and a dual-lens camera which Motorola says features AI photo capabilities for perfect shots every time no matter how bad your photography skills are. If that all sounds enticing then the £89 moto e13 will go on sale this month at stores including Amazon, Argos, Carphone Warehouse, Currys, John Lewis, 02, Tesco and Vodafone. Want something a little more impressive? Motorola has that covered with Android fans also able to get their hands on the more premium moto g73 5G and moto g53 5G.

The £269.99 moto g73 5G also features a fast 6.5-inch 120 Hz FHD+ display, powerful stereo speakers, MediaTek Dimensity 930 chipset and a 5000mAh battery with TurboPower 30W charging for fast refilling. If £270 sounds a bit rich, you can try the moto g53 5G for size instead. This £189.99 phone also gets a slick 6.5-inch 120Hz screen, speedy Snapdragon 480+ and a macro camera for impressive close-ups. Both the moto g73 5G and moto g53 5G come complete with Thinkshield for mobile, an extra layer of security that enhances protection at every level from the factory to the phone. The final two devices from Motorola include the moto g23 and moto g13 which both feature a 50MP main camera with Quad Pixel technology. They also get a 6.5-inch 90Hz HD+ and MediaTek Helio G85 processor with the more expensive moto g23 also featuring fast charging thanks to Motorola's TurboPower 30W technology.
