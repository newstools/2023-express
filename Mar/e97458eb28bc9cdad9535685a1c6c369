Prince Andrew is refusing to leave his home at Royal Lodge and instead is demanding a mansion "fit for a King", according to royal sources. King Charles is planning to cut the Duke's annual £249,000 subsidy in April, which may leave him unable to afford the upkeep of the £30million property. Sources say Andrew is lobbying Charles for a more important role as part of negotiations over Royal Lodge, even offering to help run some of the Firm's other estates such as Balmoral. The Duke believes the responsibility and prestige that come with running the properties would offer him a way back into royal life. One insider told The Mirror: "Andrew is insisting on having a job despite being made to stand down from his duties and now he’s being kicked out of his home. "He’s of the opinion that he is still a senior member of the family, despite not being a working royal and deserves to be treated as such.  "He is prepared to take on the responsibility of a big role running an estate and still thinks he is far too young to retire. "However, the King certainly has a wildly different view to that of his brother and has told him straight, there is no chance of that happening." Andrew's daughters Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie are understood to have tried to intervene on their father's behalf with the King.
