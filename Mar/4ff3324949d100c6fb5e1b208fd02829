Alex Scott has announced that she has pulled out of presenting the BBC’s Football Focus on Saturday in support of Gary Lineker. Pundits are boycotting the broadcaster this weekend after the Match of the Day host was axed for his comments made on Twitter, and the BBC are considering whether to push on with their usual football shows this weekend as a result. Scott has presented Football Focus since 2021 and has been a key figure in BBC presenting over the past few years. However, as the story of Lineker being asked to step down for his comments on the Home Secretary’s new asylum policy unravelled, the ex-Arsenal star has revealed that she informed her bosses that she would be standing with her colleague. The 38-year-old tweeted: “I made a decision last night that even though I love my show and we have had an incredible week winning an SJA for football focus that it doesn’t feel right for me to go ahead with the show today.. Hopefully I will be back in the chair next week….” It has been reported that the BBC’s Kelly Cates has been approached to replace Scott, though talkSPORT have revealed that the broadcaster is considering putting a halt to a significant portion of their football-based content this weekend. They report that the BBC are deliberating whether to remove Football Focus and Final Score from their schedule on Saturday. Pundits are ‘refusing to work’ leaving the broadcaster pondering whether to push on with their coverage.
