Denise Van Outen is enjoying some time in the sunshine with her boyfriend Jimmy Barba. Yesterday, the 48-year-old took to Instagram to show off her incredible figure in various swimsuits. The presenter wowed in a plunging black one-piece, which featured gold straps and a risque neckline. She was later seen in a white swimsuit, that came complete with an halterneck, ruching and metal detailing. Denise's beach wardrobe was not to missed, as she captioned one reel: "Marbella ES wearing @naia_beach swimwear & beach bag. Shirts @tanyaleeboutique." Fellow presenter Helen Skelton was one of the first to comment, sharing a number of flame emojis. While actress Davinia Taylor told her: "Ooooo you lucky pair. Itâ€™s freezing here!"(sic)
