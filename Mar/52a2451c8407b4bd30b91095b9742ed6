Looking just like her famous mum Tess Daly, 53, Phoebe, 18, posed for cameras on the red carpet alongside her dad Vernon, 48.  In a rare public appearance, Tess and Vernon’s eldest daughter opted for a fashionable ensemble in black leather look trousers and a white top.  She styled her blonde locks straight, as she mirrored her Strictly Come Dancing presenter mum’s dazzling red carpet-ready smile at the screening of John Wick: Chapter 4.  Vernon, who also shares daughter Amber, 13, with wife Tess, went for a smart casual outfit in jeans and a matching navy blue polo neck top.  The family outing comes after Vernon announced he had landed the tough gig of replacing veteran broadcaster Ken Bruce, 72, on BBC Radio 2.  Vernon revealed Tess and his two daughters are “over the moon” for him, as he chatted to co-star Zoe Ball about his new mid-morning show.
