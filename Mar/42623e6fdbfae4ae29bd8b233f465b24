The US Federal Aviation Administration is investigating a close-call crash involving two planes at Boston's Logan Airport after a flight took off without permission on Monday. The incident, which happened at around 7pm, involved a JetBlue plane and a Learjet plane. The JetBlue pilot had to take "evasive action" while landing the plane as the other aircraft crossed an intersecting runway. The pilot of a Learjet 60 is believed to have taken off without clearance, according to a preliminary review from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). When on the runway, the Learjet pilot was instructed by the air traffic controller to "line up and wait" while the JetBlue flight was approaching the ground, the FFA said. The agency said in a statement: "The Learjet pilot read back the instructions clearly but began a take-off roll instead. "The pilot of the JetBlue aircraft took evasive action and initiated a climb-out as the Learjet crossed the intersection.
