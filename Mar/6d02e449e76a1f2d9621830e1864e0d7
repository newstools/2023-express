Pep Guardiola believes it is only a matter of time before Vincent Kompany fulfils his “destiny” and becomes the Manchester City manager. The current City boss is not about to walk out of the Etihad any time soon. But when he eventually does call time on his stunning reign in charge of the six-time Premier League champions, he can think of no better candidate to replace him than his old captain. “He will be back sooner or later,” he said. Guardiola, whose side will face Kompany’s Championship-leading Burnley in the FA Cup quarter-finals, added: “I think his destiny to be the manager of Manchester City is already written in the stars. “It’s going to happen, I don’t know when but it is going to happen. It is my feeling, maybe I am wrong but he has the attributes: work ethic, knowledge of the game, well respected and experienced. “Doing what he has done is so difficult and he is doing really well. He knows the club, the environment, the fans, what our people need. The destiny is there.” Kompany’s Clarets are charging virtually unchallenged back to the Premier League at the first time of asking and, added to his work at Anderlecht, Guardiola says nobody can fail to be impressed. The Catalan said: “What I like of him, he proves himself. Anderlecht one of the historic teams in Belgium, young players. He took a risk. He went to Burnley after they were relegated where there was pressure. “In terms of results and the way they play. He proves himself, not just directly to go to a top, top team.” Burnley sit 12 points clear of Sheffield United after playing 34 games of the Championship campaign. The Lancashire club have lost just twice in the league, though Kompany’s charges suffered a pre-Christmas Carabao Cup defeat at the hands of Manchester United at Old Trafford. Whether the Belgian can pull off a stunning upset against his former club will be determined on Saturday March 18.
