So comfortable and easy to dress up.'' Pauly60 commented: ''Snug fit and make you look slimmer. Had many compliments.'' LivSidz28 also added: ''Great fit. True to size although I bought a long, and they’re really very long! Not a bad problem to have tho. Very flattering, and waaaay warmer than expected. I shall probably buy a regular length to wear with flats as the weather improves.''
