A warning has been issued to anyone who banks with Santander, NatWest, Barclays, HSBC, or Halifax. It comes following a new study that showed the top five banks in the UK where customers are most at risk of fraud.    The results revealed that Santander customers were the most at risk of fraud. Experts at VPN Overview analysed Google search data to discover the search volume for multiple terms, including "fraud number" and "fraud helpline", combining these to determine which banks have the highest number of customers experiencing scams. Santander ranked first with the highest risk of customers becoming victims of fraud. NatWest and Barclays followed in second and third, respectively, with the Co-Operative bank having the lowest risk of customers falling victim to fraud, reports The Liverpool Echo. A spokesperson from VPN Overview commented on the findings as they said: "Currently, there are an abundance of phishing scams circling looking to steal bank details and other personal information. "These will aim to trick you via texts, emails, and even phone calls. "While the study reflects that customers of these particular banks are more likely to be a victim of fraud, it’s crucial for everyone to be wary of these dangerous scams – regardless of whether their bank is listed in the top five. "To avoid falling victim to phishing scams, it’s essential to never click on unfamiliar links in emails or texts or to provide personal information on a phone call that you receive. "If ever uncertain, you can always call your bank to find out if any text, call, or email you receive is genuine."
