Los Angeles Lakers star Anthony Davis knows that the weight of the team now must be put on his shoulders after losing LeBron James to an injury which will rule the megastar forward out for several weeks. James suffered an ankle injury in a recent win over the Dallas Mavericks and was seen limping out of the building before tests revealed he'd need time away to heal. James has avoided surgery, but will be out for at least three weeks - and potentially the entire season, if the Lakers do not continue on their winning streak in order to make the playoffs. Losing James is a crushing blow to the team that has come on leaps and bounds since making a number of trades before the deadline, improving their overall roster. But with the team still in 12th position in the western conference, three wins outside of the playoffs, they will need to get the best play possible from their other superstar Davis if they are to have a shot at making the postseason. That's something Davis is aware of, as he knows he now must lead the new-look, young Lakers team. Speaking on James, Davis said: "He’s not coming back any time soon. So we can’t feel sorry for ourselves. "We can’t put our head down and say, ‘Oh we miss Bron.’ We have to go out and compete to the level that we did tonight." Davis has shown he is more than capable of handling the load as the go-to man, playing at an MVP level earlier this season before missing team with nagging injuries. That has been the story of his career to date, although winning an NBA championship with James and the Lakers in 2020, Davis must now prove that he's able to truly lead the team - which could be a pivotal moment in his career.
