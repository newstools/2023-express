  Paige Deville, 26, who previously starred on Gogglebox alongside her mum Sally Hayward, has likened the show’s filming process to a “pantomime”. The former Channel 4 star specifically recalled being advised not to make negative remarks about ex-Prime Minister Boris Johnson.      In an eye-opening new interview, Paige has opened up about her behind-the-scenes experience of Channel 4 favourite Gogglebox. The recruitment business owner starred in the show for three seasons before she quit for good back in 2021. Paige, who formed one half of a mother-daughter Brummie duo with mum Sally, insisted that political opinions would not be aired and that the snacks captured on camera would rarely be eaten. She explained how, while producers don't force cast members to say anything they don't want to, they might make suggestions for how to react in certain scenes, READ MORE: Emmerdale star splits from actor husband 'falls for new co-star'    Likening the filming process to a “pantomime”, she described how certain opinions wouldn’t make it onto the show. “They wouldn’t tell you, 'Say this word for word,' but they prep you to say things and warn you about comments that won’t make it into the show," she told The Sun. “Once Boris [Johnson] was on and I was like, ‘Oh my God, well he’s not done anything has he? What has he done for this country?’ “They were like, ‘That was never going to be aired Paige’ and wanted me to say something like, ‘Oh my God, he’s doing a great job.'”       Paige went on to claim that reactions were often lined-up and prompted by the show’s producers. “If you’re watching a juicy clip, producers say, ‘You’re going to absolutely love this’ through the speakers,” she said. “Sometimes they give you a ‘three, two, one’ countdown which gears you up and gets you ready to react. It’s a bit of a pantomime behind the scenes.” In September 2021, Paige announced she would be stepping down from her role on Gogglebox for a number of reasons including long hours of filming and a supposed lack of support from the show.

"It’s been an experience but one I cannot continue with due to long hours of filming, restrictiveness, control of our actions and opinions and zero aftercare support but hey who cares about ex-cast, their NTA winners." Paige went on to say that a drama within her family had sparked her decision to leave Gogglebox. She wrote at the time: “There have been problems within the family and my mum was given an ultimatum.      "The decision means I have nothing to do with her now. "I think the decision is irreversible. It is very sad but that’s life unfortunately.” Speaking to Birmingham Live, she added she was invited back to film with another family member on the show, but declined.
