The biggest stars in Hollywood have been descending on the Oscars 2023 red carpet, which has been transformed into an opulent champagne hue for the first time, in honour of the 95th Academy Awards. Eva Longoria, 47, and Oscar nominee for Blonde, Ana de Armas, 34, led the way in showstopping plunging gowns at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles. Meanwhile, Florence Pugh, 27, flew the flag for the UK in a leg-flashing little black mini dress, which the Don't Worry Darling star switched up with a bold train and exaggerated puff sleeves. After posing up a storm for cameras, the stars made their way into the ceremony, which is being hosted by comedian Jimmy Kimmel, 55. Leading the Oscar nominations this year are musical blockbuster Elvis, Everything Everywhere All At Once, Cate Blanchett's Tar, and Steven Spielberg's The Fabelmans.
