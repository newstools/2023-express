A dad has taken to social media to share his frustrations after he claimed a dinner lady insisted his daughter eats vegetables at lunchtime. Dad of three Ross Hunt, from Wales, went to extreme lengths after becoming irritated by staff at his daughter's school who attempted to control what she eats at lunchtime. He claimed dinner ladies told his daughter that she had to eat her vegetables and sandwich before her sweet treats, leading to him putting a note in her lunchbox to stop them "sticking their nose in (his) daughter's business". The label that he stuck on the inside of the lunchbox read: "Welcome to my daughters' Lunch Box! We are aware of the contents of this box and are happy for her to eat whatever she wants." He shared the note on TikTok where commenters applauded the father's efforts. In the clip, he said he was "irritated" by one of the dinner ladies who had been telling her what she was allowed to eat. He said the badgering has been "putting her off from taking her lunch with them". "It's alright if you eat the chocolate cake the school gives you but if you put one in their lunchbox they go 'oh no you shouldn't have that'," he added. Ross said he had printed a second, less appropriate label which his wife refused to let him put on the lunchbox. It read: "Step away from the lunch box, you nosey f******** a*** bandit." He said he was tempted to fill the lunchbox with sweets but added a sandwich, carrot sticks, an apple, a pear, a small bag of crisps, rainbow drop lollies and a chocolate egg.

But in a follow-up video, he claimed the note had not worked after his daughter was told to eat her carrot sticks before the rainbow drops - which she then decided not to touch. He added: "She did eat her sandwich, which for reference this sandwich would have contained more sugar than these rainbow drops. That is six grams of rainbow drops - calm down." She ate some of her apple but didn't touch her pear, crisps or chocolate egg because she said she didn't have time.  Don't miss...

"In short stick your f***ing nose out of my kid's business hopefully this will get dealt with but I f***ing doubt it." And other parents appeared to agree with Ross, with one user writing: "Worked in a school which served cake but we had to confiscate a penguin bar from a kids lunchbox as itâ€™s not allowed. It's silly, to be honest." Another said: "I work in a school and have this argument often. I would rather a child ate and was full than lots of 'healthy' foods they won't eat."
