A mum and her toddler who died in a collision on a busy A-road on Friday have been named by their families. Formal identification has not yet taken place, but they have been named as Nicola Courtney, 34, and three-year-old Lucas Page, from Scunthorpe.   Their families are being supported by specialist trained police officers and partnering agencies. The crash happened just after 9pm on Friday night when a white articulated lorry was travelling westbound along the A180, Immingham between Stallingborough and Brocklesby, when it collided with stationary blue Ford Focus. It is thought that the Ford Focus had broken down in a live lane. Emergency services rushed to the scene of the collision but Ms Courtney and her son could not be saved and they were pronounced dead at the roadside.   A Humberside Police spokesperson said: "The full circumstances of the collision will be established during this complex investigation, and we would ask for people not to speculate about the circumstances of the crash." "We are continuing to appeal for any witnesses who have not yet spoken to us to get in touch. "If you saw either the collision itself, the vehicles prior to the collision or if you have any dash-cam footage showing the vehicles prior to the collision, please call our non-emergency number 101 quoting log 557 of 10 March. A voluntary referral has been made to the Independent Office of Police Complaints (IOPC) in relation to the collision.
