Some two million households who use alternative energy sources were set to receive a £200 payment in February, including those who use heating oil, biomass and LPG (liquefied petroleum gas). Most people were due to receive the funds automatically while those with no direct energy supplier had to apply. A woman called Jackie who uses heating oil phoned in to the BBC Martin Lewis podcast on March 1, as she had not received the £200 payment. She spoke of her frustration as she didn’t know who to contact as she is not off grid and had received her £400 energy bills discount automatically, but not the £200 Alternative Fuel Payment. She said: “We don’t know where to go, who to contact or whether we’re going to get it.” Mr Lewis asked how she pays for her energy and she said by standing credit. The financial journalist said in this case she should get the money added to her energy account.
