It’s been years in the making and now The Super Mario Bros Movie is less than a month away. The computer-animated blockbuster has been produced by Nintendo in collaboration with Illumination, the studio behind the highly successful Minions movies. Its final trailer has landed today on Super Mario Day (because it’s March 10 aka Mar10, get it) and the cast has released a special video you can view below. The Super Mario Bros Movie synopsis reads: “While working underground to fix a water main, Brooklyn plumbers Mario (Chris Pratt; Jurassic World and The LEGO Movie franchises) and brother Luigi (Charlie Day; It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia) are transported down a mysterious pipe and wander into a magical new world. But when the brothers are separated, Mario embarks on an epic quest to find Luigi. With the assistance of a Mushroom Kingdom resident Toad (Keegan-Michael Key; The Lion King) and some training from the strong-willed ruler of the Mushroom Kingdom, Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy; The Queen’s Gambit), Mario taps into his own power. “The Super Mario Bros. Movie features an extraordinary comedic cast, including Jack Black (Jumanji films) as Bowser, Seth Rogen (Neighbors franchise) as Donkey Kong, Fred Armisen (Portlandia, Saturday Night Live) as Cranky Kong, Kevin Michael Richardson (American Dad!, Family Guy) as Kamek and Sebastian Maniscalco (Green Book) as Spike, plus a special voice appearance by Charles Martinet, who has voiced the characters of Mario and Luigi in the Super Mario games for more than 30 years.” READ MORE: Super Mario Movie star 'humbled' by Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero role The new Nintendo movie is directed by Teen Titans Go!’s Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic and was written by Matthew Fogel who penned Minions: The Rise of Gru and The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part.
