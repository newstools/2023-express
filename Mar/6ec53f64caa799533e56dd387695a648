Opener UK Grim is urgent, nagging and desolate, as Williamson unleashes a tirade of grime-inspired rap about Vladimir Putin and class.  He’s got “crisis stamina, full marathon”, he rants before turning his attention to how the other half live – “white Range Rovers… lunch bellies, threesomes and wealth measles. I want it all,” he adds. “Like a crack forest gateau.” There’s nothing here you could whistle. But, as Jason says, “I’m not ’ere to please you, mate”. Instead, the Mods seek to “touch a nerve with people at their wits’ end” with their minimalist recipe of repetition, rage and more casual swearing than Agnes Brown. These 14 tracks are awash with bitter jealousy and a large helping of chippy resentment. So Trendy, a collaboration with Jane’s Addiction’s Perry Farrell and Dave Navarro, is the closest they get to a song – but don’t expect Ken Bruce to play it any time soon. Why attacks “B&M goths” who “look like Fred Dibnah” and turn rebellion into fashion? Jason’s previous targets include Ed Sheeran, Blur and Kasabian but, as ever, the real meat here is political. Recent single Force 10 From Navarone, featuring Dry Cleaning’s Florence Shaw, sees Williamson confront his own depression as well as taking pot shots at “the myth of activism… in the presence of a corrupt government”. Britain, he rages, is a country “that still believes it’s not dead… but it is”. We’ll see. Tracks like Tory Kong and Right Wing Beast place the former benefits adviser firmly to the left of Corbyn. There’s a market for it, in the album Top 10 if not Number 10.
