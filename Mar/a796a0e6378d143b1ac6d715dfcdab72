Last year the presenter was rushed into surgery after his terrifying health condition left him minutes from death. He was hospitalised with chest pains that he mistook for long Covid, but learned he was suffering from pericardial effusion. The condition is a build-up of fluid in the structure around the heart. Luckily, the surgery was a success but he was forced to "re-adjust" his work schedule. In a video shared with his fans last week, Martin said the episode which had aired was the first he had filmed since returning to work. He said: "I wore a very bright shirt as a way of saying thank you for all your support. “Well the show went out yesterday, so you can actually see what I was doing on that day. "It just reminded me how much your help got me through that terrible time,” he said while holding back tears.
