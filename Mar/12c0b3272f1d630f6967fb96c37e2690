Gary Lineker had remained solid in his stance this morning, hours before a BBC source told The Sun: "We have spoken to Gary and he won't face any disciplinary action. "From our perspective, the situation has been resolved now and we want him to get back to what he's best at, which is being a brilliant sports presenter." The 62-year-old fell under incredible scrutiny after hitting out at the latest government policy, hoping to manage the migrant crisis posed by arrivals in small boats over the English channel. The Match of the Day presenter compared the language used to launch the policy with that used in 1930s Germany as the Nazi party took to power. The comment sparked an outcry of requests for the presenter to be sacked or suspended by the BBC, as well as an intense reaction from Downing Street. Today, the presenter told reporters outside his London home that he stood by his criticisms and didn't fear being suspended by the BBC. While Gary’s reaction has faced countless criticisms, he has also found some unsuspecting supporters in the likes of Piers Morgan and Sky News’ Adam Boulton.
