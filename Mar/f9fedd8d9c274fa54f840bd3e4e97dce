Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have been accused of playing a "dangerous game" in the US after news of their daughter Lilibet's christening was first broken by People magazine, despite the Sussexes claiming in 2020 they intended to "amend their media relations policy" and would "engage with grassroots media organisations and young, up-and-coming journalists" upon stepping down from royal duties. Royal commentator Daniela Elser pointed out in an op-ed for the New Zealand Herald that despite Harry tearing down the Firm for playing the media game, he has done just that with the promotion for his memoir Spare, which has seen him give a number of revealing interviews for mainstream media outlets. She wrote: "This week’s Lili christening story was broken by the most tabloid of titles, and by a London-based journalist who frequently covers the Royal Family and has to spend grey mornings in Welsh towns reporting on the Princess of Wales’ outings, no less." She added: "To be clear here, the actual story does not directly quote the duke or duchess – but it does include confirmation from a spokesperson and details about when the event took place (Friday, March 3) and by whom (“the bishop in the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles, the Rev John Taylor”) along with a plethora of intimate details. Yet there has been no outcry by the duke and duchess about their privacy being breached, about the press poking their rapacious noses into the family’s private life." Ms Elser said that Harry's mother Princess Diana also had a similar relationship to the press, sometimes courting the attention and at other times crying out against being hounded.
