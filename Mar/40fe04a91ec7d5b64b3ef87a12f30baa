A thug stole a veteran's bank card and used it to buy KFC about an hour after raiding his house. Jordan Nicole Davies, though, was only given a year-long community order and was released from jail having spent four months inside on remand.  Marian Olejnik's home was broken into and Davies, 28, by a "large", balaclava-wearing man who pinned him to the wall. Mr Olejnik, 65, called in Davies, 28, for help but she went around the house, searching through his property, reports North Wales Live. Emmalyne Downing, prosecuting, said it appeared to the victim that Davies was "acting on the man's instructions" when she left with his wallet that had his debit card inside in December last year. Roughly an hour later, Mr Olejnik was alerted via an email from his bank that his card had been used at the KFC chain in nearby Wrexham city centre. Some £17 was spent in the fast food restaurant. Davies had spent four months in remand ahead of her court appearance and Recorder Simon Mills, sitting at Mold Crown Court, decided this was a sufficient jail term for handling stolen goods. She was released from jail and instead handed a year-long community order. Defending, Owen Edwards, said the the offending was brought about by the influence of the unidentified man whom the defendant said was "no longer in her life" and that Davies intended to move away from the area and "start afresh". The judge also had to take into account that Davies has been locked up on remand at HMP Styal since her first court appearance. It meant she stood before the court on March 8 having already served the equivalent of a four-month custodial sentence. Recorder Mills said that he believed it would in the interest of justice to offer Davies, of Wrexham, some stability to get her life on track. Davies was tasked with completing a 25-day rehabilitation programme and also ordered to pay a £50 fine out of her Universal Credit allowance within the next six months.
