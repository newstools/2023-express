Saffron Barker, 22, set pulses racing when she slipped into a minuscule black bikini for a sultry photoshoot. The YouTuber had visited Soho Farmhouse, a private members' club in Oxfordshire, and showed off her enviable figure in her skimpy two-piece. Saffron will be remembered for competing in the 2019 series of Strictly Come Dancing. She was partnered with former I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here! star AJ Pritchard and they made it to Week 10 of the competition. She has also appeared on BBC's The Greatest Dancer, a YouTube Original series, and Channel 4's The Circle.
