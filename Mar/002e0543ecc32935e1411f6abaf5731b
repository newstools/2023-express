A group of protesters demonstrated at a Best Western hotel's decision to close - so it can house some 250 asylum seekers. It is understood the company's Yew Lodge hotel in Kegworth, Leicestershire, has an "exclusive contract" with the Home Office and, as a result, has cancelled bookings for the foreseeable future.  Police were in attendance at the protest and patrolled the area close to the hotel, reports Leicestershire Live. However, the protest was reportedly peaceful, with chants of "Save Our Village" being heard through a speakerphone. There were approximately 100 people taking part, substantially fewer than previous demonstrations. The Home Office says it is essential to find places to house those seeking asylum while they process their applications - with the asylum system currently "under incredible strain". A Home Office spokesperson told Leicestershire Live previously: "The number of people arriving in the UK who require accommodation has reached record levels and has put our asylum system under incredible strain. "We engage with local authorities as early as possible whenever sites are used for asylum accommodation and work to ensure arrangements are safe for hotel residents and local people." Local politicians, however, aren't convinced by the Home Office's suggestions that the area is being consulted, with both MP Andrew Bridgen and Kegworth Parish Council saying they have steadfastly been against using local hotels in the plans. Mr Bridgen spoke previously on this issue, urging the Home Secretary to intervene. He said: "This idea first came up in September last year and I protested strongly that the venue was wholly unsuitable. The idea was then dropped. "I’m therefore surprised that the plan has resurfaced. I have contacted the Home Office again to cite reasons why this is not a suitable venue and suggested other sites. I have also contacted the Home Secretary personally and asked her to intervene." Best Western has been approached for comment.
