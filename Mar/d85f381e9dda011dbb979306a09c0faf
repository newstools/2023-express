Rose Ayling-Ellis, 28, gave her 537,000 Instagram followers a rare glimpse inside Buckingham Palace after being invited by King Charles III’s wife Camilla, 75, in honour of the occasion.  Strictly winner and former EastEnders star Rose joined a star-studded guest list of inspiring women to celebrate International Women’s Day, arriving at the palace alongside Happy Valley actress Sarah Lancashire, 58, and Antiques Roadshow host Fiona Bruce, 58.  The star, who made history as Strictly’s first deaf contestant in 2021, looked stunning in a chic white crop top, which she paired with matching trousers and heels.  Sharing the news of her royal experience, Rose captioned a shot of herself outside Buckingham Palace in London: “Honoured to have been invited to Buckingham Palace to celebrate International Women’s Day.  “The people working to make a world where women and girls can be exactly who they want to be were all truly empowering. Here’s to unapologetically taking up space.”  Rose even took the opportunity to sneakily pose for a photo inside the palace, captioning the mirror selfie: “Couldn’t resist a little cheeky bathroom selfie.”
