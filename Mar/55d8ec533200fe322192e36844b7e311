Movie lovers are getting a content boost this month with a number of award-winning blockbusters being added for free. The extra content comes courtesy of GREAT! with the service promising that it will be broadcasting critically acclaimed movies throughout March. Things kick off on Tuesday 7th March at 9pm with GREAT! Movies Action showing Academy Award-winning film Black Hawk Down starring Tom Hardy and Ewan McGregor. This movie is based on a true story of a war waged in Mogadishu by the high-tech Black Hawk helicopters and the US Army Rangers and Deltas. This will then be followed by Oscar-winner Emma starring Gwyneth Paltrow which tells the story of Emma Woodhouse, a congenial young lady who delights in meddling in other peopleâ€™s affairs. Another classic movie is Chocolat with Judy Dench. It's a sweet story of Vianne who sets up a very unusual chocolate shop in a tranquil, old-fashioned French town. Jack Nicholson's Oscar-nominated A Few Good Men is also coming later in March along with A Beautiful Mind, which won 4 Academy Awards, and epic crime drama American Gangster. If that movie marathon has got you excited then here's every free film coming this month, when it will be shown and what channel it's on.
