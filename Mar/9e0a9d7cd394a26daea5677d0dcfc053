Robert Brown is set for automatic release just halfway into his 26-year sentence for killing his estranged wife Joanna Simpson in 2011. The British Airways pilot hit her over the head several times with a hammer whilst their children slept in the next room, before burying her in a grave he dug earlier. Despite the brutality of the murder, he was only convicted of manslaughter due to diminished responsibility. As a result, he dodged a murder charge. In response to the pressure, Mr Raab said he would meet with the family after they asked to speak to him about failures in their case.

Joining in the campaign to block his release is Joanna’s mother, Diana Parkes, 83, who has launched an appeal to stop him from being released. She told the Sun: “I worry for everybody because this man is not safe. He will stop at nothing and we will be constantly looking over our shoulders. Let common sense please rule the day. “This man is not fit to be let out. He should stay in jail for at least his full sentence.” Ms Parkes will be joined by Ms Patel and Mrs Johnson at an event in London to highlight the failings in the case and ask Mr Raab to keep Brown behind bars.
