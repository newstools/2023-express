President of the Catalan Government, Pere Aragonès, addressed the famiies of the dead on Thursday.

Potash is used as a fertiliser and as a raw material in the pharmaceutical, explosives, glassmaking and chemicals industries. A similar incident in 2013 led to the deaths of two workers at the same mining facility. The two operators were with colleagues on a night shift when a slab from above fell on top of them. More recently, two incidents in the space of a few weeks in June 2020 also saw two miners die at one of the company's mines. After the second death, the company announced that it was closing this mine. ICL has two mines in Bages, one in Súria, and one in Vilafruns. The company group was formed as a result of the unification of two brands belonging to the company. More to follow...
