 The 20-year-old Wednesday star stunned at the premiere of Scream VI on Monday evening in New York City. In a daring black and white Jean Paul Gaultier ensemble with a plunging neckline, but the actress seemingly had a mishap before stepping out for the evening. On her otherwise flawless white shirt, Jenna sported an unfortunate bright blue ink stain which appeared midway through the event. However, pairing the outfit with sparking Tiffany & Co jewellery and a bold red lip seemed to distract fans just enough. The star strutted the film premiere alongside her costars Hayden Panettiere and Courteney Cox. Courteney is the only original cast member from the Scream franchise to feature in this latest instalment and just last week revealed her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
