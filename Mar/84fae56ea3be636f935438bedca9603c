Jonnie Irwin, 49, and Jasmine Harman, 47, joined forces at A Place In The Sun Live in Manchester over the weekend. The co-stars, who have worked together for almost 20 years, were pictured for the first time since Jonnie went public with his terminal cancer diagnosis. Jonnie looked in good spirits as he and Jasmine spoke to fans at the convention centre. The night before, he shared his outfit with plans and explained it would be an "early start" because he is "not fit enough" to get the train. Jonnie was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2020. In November, he confirmed the sad news that the tumours have spread to his brain.
