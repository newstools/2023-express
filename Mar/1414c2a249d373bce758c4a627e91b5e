World Book Day is a registered charity that aims to give every child and young person a book of their own, with youngsters dressing up as their favourite characters. The day celebrates the work of authors, illustrators and reading in general. Many famous faces have taken part in the big day, with their parents showing off their phenomenal outfits online. Boris Johnson's son Wilfred, two, was seen sporting an adorable dinosaur costume as he posed holding The Dinosaur That Pooped Easter children's book. Helen Flanagan shared a picture of her three children in their costumes before they set off for school, which included her youngest as Stick Man.
