A man in his 20s has been taken to the hospital after being "shot in his knees and his right ankle" at his home in West Belfast, police have said. Three masked men, who were wearing gloves and forced their way into a home in the Crocus Street area shortly after 9pm, are believed to be behind the attack. They reportedly fled the scene in Cavendish Street direction. The victim was left "seriously injured" and was swiftly taken to the hospital for treatment of his injuries on Tuesday. PSNI Detective Sergeant McCartan said: "Police received a report on Tuesday, 7th March that three masked men who were wearing gloves, forced their way into a home in the Crocus Street area shortly after 9pm."A man, aged in his 20s, was shot three times in both his knees and right ankle, causing serious injuries. The men then fled the scene on foot and made off towards the Cavendish Street direction."The victim was subsequently taken to hospital for treatment to his injuries."  Mr McCartan said the police investigation is at an early stage, adding they are investigating "a number of lines of enquiry" to determine what happened, a motive and who was involved."However, this shooting is a clear human rights abuse and everyone has the right to live free from the threat of violence and feel safe in their own homes. "The horrific violence that was inflicted on this man will most certainly leave physical and mental scars and trauma that may never heal. Victims of such attacks often have their lives changed forever." Detectives are now calling on the public to give any information that could help with the investigation.
