Footage shows the shocking moment a woman falls six floors from a balcony and is seemingly unhurt, quickly walking back to her home as if nothing had happened.Â The video was taken in Kazan, the capital of the Russian Republic of Tatarstan. The footage was shared by local media outlets and has since gone viral on social media. The woman, who is 42 years old according to reports, fell from the sixth floor - of what appears to be an apartment complex - into a pile of snow. It is thought the snow broke the fall and saved the woman's life as she walked away unharmed. After the fall, the woman is seen getting up on her own and walking off as if nothing had happened as shocked passersby watched on.  According to RT, the building's concierge, seeing the 20-metre fall, went to help the woman who was covered in snow. But shockingly, she only asked him to open the lobby door to go back home. From the images captured by the building's security camera, the fall may not have been accidentally given her behaviour prior to the fall. Later, in statements to the police, who arrived following a call from neighbours who witnessed what happened, the woman explained that she had locked herself in one of the rooms in her flat and decided to jump out of the window in order to get back in.
