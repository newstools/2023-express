Prince Harry and Meghan Markle could "hold the upper hand" at King Charlesâ€™s Coronation as they will "always be in the headlines", a palace insider has claimed. This appears to be due to the vast amount of interest in whether the Sussexes will attend or "stay at home in California". Speaking to Page Six, an insider said: "Whatever happens, Harry and Meghan will always be the ones in the headlines. "Whether they come or they stay at home in California, they do hold the upper hand." Earlier this week, a spokesperson for the couple confirmed the news that Meghan and Harry had been "requested to vacate their residence at Frogmore Cottage". Speaking of the couple's recent eviction, by the King, from Frogmore Cottage, the insider also said that now is the ideal time to remove them from the Windsor-based property because there is "not much sympathy left for Harry and Meghan in the UK". A source told the couple's unofficial biographer Omid Scobie that "initially they were given just weeks" to remove their belongings, but now have "at least until after the Coronation".
