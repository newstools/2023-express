Comedian Chris Rock has satirised Meghan Markle's race claim in his new Netflix special, taking aim at comments the Duchess of Sussex made during her interview with Oprah Winfrey, in which she accused an unnamed member of the Royal Family of racism and said that she felt isolated within the royal household. The comedian ruthlessly mocked Meghan's claim, suggesting she was simply dealing with "some in-law s***" while noting that she won the "light-skinned lottery". Rock also claimed "even black people want to know how brown" her child would be in a brutal takedown. Meghan became the butt of the US comedian's jokes during a bit about victimhood. "Like who is this girl Meghan Markle? Seems like a nice lady, just complaining," he began. "Like didn't she hit the light-skinned lottery?" Rock then went all in on Meghan's now infamous interview with Oprah last year.

It was just some in-law s***. "Sometimes it's just some in-law s*** because she's complaining, I'm like "What the f*** is she talking about?" The SNL comedian added: "'Oprah, they're so racist they wanted to know how brown the baby was going to be,'" he again mocked Meghan. "I'm like, 'That's not racist, because even black people want to know how brown the baby going to be.'"

Pressed on his wife’s remarks to Oprah in March 2021, the duke said: “Yeah, there were concerns about his skin colour." Asked whether he would not describe that as “essentially racist”, Harry said: “I wouldn’t. Not having lived within that family. “Going back to the difference between what my understanding is, because of my own experience, the difference between racism and unconscious bias – the two things are different.” READ MORE: 'Meghan was not as cool': Rebel Wilson admits Prince Harry 'warmer' than Duchess Asked by Oprah about whether she believed the Royal Family allegedly hadn’t wanted their son Archie to be a prince “because of his race”, Meghan replied: “But I can give you an honest answer. “In those months when I was pregnant ... we have in tandem the conversation of, ‘He won’t be given security. He’s not going to be given a title’, and also concerns and conversations about how dark his skin might be when he’s born.” Telling a dismayed Oprah that “there were several conversations about it”, the Duchess said that she would not reveal who had made the remarks, on the grounds that: “I think that would be very damaging to them.” Pressed further, she added: “That was relayed to me from Harry. Those were conversations that family had with him ... It was really hard to be able to see those as compartmentalised conversations.” Asked by Oprah whether the question about Archie’s skin colour was allegedly raised “because they were concerned that if he were too brown, that that would be a problem”, Meghan said: “I wasn’t able to follow up with why, but that — if that’s the assumption you’re making, I think that feels like a pretty safe one, which was really hard to understand.” Rock's takedown comes after Harry and Meghan were spoofed in the latest season of South Park, which followed a "prince and princess of Canada" as they embarked on a "Worldwide Privacy Tour".
