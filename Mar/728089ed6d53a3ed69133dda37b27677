A family of dogs including three newborn bubbies were rescued from the wreckage of Turkey's earthquake, a month after the devastating event. The four adorable Dobermans were pulled out of the rubble of a building in Hatay, Turkey, 28 days after the 7.8 magnitude earthquake. Kadir Keyifli, the owner of the unbreakable mother Sila, had been desperately asking for local rescue teams to help get his two-and-a-half-year-old dog out. But nobody was able to enter the dangerous pile mountain of debris. Fortunately, an animal rescue team called Meyako offered Kadir help on Monday. Following hours of work, they reached Sila who was trapped in the building's basement. However, it wasn't just Sila they found, but also three new puppies she had given birth to.

The team had entered a narrow gap in the rubble and broke a hole in a door so they could enter the basement, which somehow stayed mostly intact. Meyako shared a video of the rescue in which Keyifli is heard saying: "My dogs are coming out after one month. "Thank God."  Don't miss...

The dogs were treated in the nearby city of Adana. Although Sila looked skinny after the ordeal, she was still able to walk unaided, explained Meyako rescue workers.

The catastrophe has left nearly 52,000 dead and roughly 6,400 buildings destroyed across the two countries.
