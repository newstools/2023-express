Dallas Cowboys head coach Mike McCarthy has not held back in his criticism of his own former playcaller Kellen Moore just weeks after firing him. Moore had been the Cowboys offensive coordinator since 2019, seen as an ascending coach and more of the play inventive playcallers in the league. In 2022, Moore had surprised many by leading the Dallas Cowboys to being the number one ranked offense in the league, despite losing number one wide receiver Amari Cooper and right tackle La'el Collins. Moore implemented a pass-heavy offense for quarterback Dak Prescott, something that many have been clamouring for in Dallas with their talent at wide receiver and tight end. And while McCarthy was happy with the offense putting up points as frequently as they did, he believed Moore's priorities were not in the correct order, and let the media know about it. Speaking at the NFL Scouting Combine, McCarthy said: "I’ve been where Kellen has been: Kellen wants to light the scoreboard up. "But I want to run the damn ball so I can rest my defense. I don’t desire to be the No. 1 offense in the league. I want to be the No. 1 team in the league with a number of wins and a championship. "And if we have to give up some production and take care of the ball better to get that, then that’s what we’ll do." McCarthy essentially blaming Moore for the high-risk, high-reward style of play came as a surprise to many, as did his firing. Moore was quickly snapped up by the Los Angeles Chargers, where he will now call plays for one of the more talented passers in the league in Justin Herbert.
