A house has been severely damaged in a fire after a phone charging overnight overheated. Emergency services were sent to a mid-terrace property in Harlow, Essex, on Tuesday at around 8.10pm. When firefighters arrived at the scene, they found a first-floor bedroom of the property on fire.  The blaze was fully extinguished by 8.45pm but firefighters found the phone charger malfunctioned, which caused the fire. The fire was contained in the bedroom, which is significantly damaged, and the Essex County Fire and Rescue Service confirmed considerable smoke damage to the first floor. And an investigation into the circumstance confirmed the fire was caused by a phone charger, reports Essex Live. Watch Manager Ross Daynes said: "Crews did a fantastic job to contain the fire to the bedroom, although there was considerable smoke damage to the first floor. "This incident highlights the importance of charging electrical items safely. "The charger had been left on the bed and when it overheated it set fire to the bedding. "Make sure you do not overcharge items, don't leave items unattended when they are charging and make sure your charger is of a good quality. "It was very fortunate that the family noticed the fire when they did and were able to get out and call 999, because there were no working smoke alarms."  Experts say the incident should serve as a warning to phone owners. An device safety expert, at Electrical Safety First, said: "Don’t charge any electrical devices, including phones and tablets, on your bed or under your pillow while you sleep as they could overheat and cause a fire. "If possible, avoid charging devices unattended or overnight, and when necessary only charge them on a hard surface such as a desk." Use caution when buying phone chargers, as many are imported and do not satisfy UK safety regulations.
