Next week, you will be able to feast your eyes upon the third Full Moon of 2023. On Tuesday, March 7, the Worm Moon will rise over the United Kingdom in all its glory, reaching peak illumination at 12.40pm.  It is widely accepted that this Full Moon gets its name from the earthworms that come out when the soil warms up; these worms provide birds and other animals with food. This Full Moon occurs at the changing of the seasons from winter to spring. Another name for March's Full Moon comes from the Anglo who called it the Lenten Moon.  The Full Moon is the lunar phase when the moon appears fully illuminated from Earth's perspective. They occur every 29.5 days, the length of time it takes for the Moon to orbit the Earth and complete one lunar phase cycle. When more than 98 per cent of the Moon's disc is illuminated, the Moon can appear to be full a day before or after. There will be 13 Full Moons this year, with two falling in August. This occurs every 2.8 years, and we get a "Blue Moon"—the name was first penned in the March 1946 issue of Sky & Telescope magazine. The Worm Moon will be followed by the Pink Moon on April 6, Flower Moon on May 5, and the Strawberry Moon on June 3.
