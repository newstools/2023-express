It’s been almost half a century since Elvis Presley died but he remains The King of not just rock and roll, but also all solo artists ever. The late singer is the best-selling of all time with claimed sales of over 500 million copies. In fact, only The Beatles are ahead of him in the most successful music acts ever. Now new research has discovered that Elvis has also beaten the likes of Michael Jackson and Frank Sinatra in another music record. Experts from Offline Marketing Company Oppizi have compiled the Top 10 US Artists of all time who have sold the most physical copies of their music. Elvis leads the way having sold 135,210,000 units, which isn’t surprising given that a recent poll revealed that 47 per cent of Americans still consider themselves fans of The King. Following the release of Baz Luhrmann’s biopic and all the Oscars buzz surrounding star Austin Butler, no doubt new fans from younger generations have been sparked by the movie. Meanwhile, Elvis’ best-selling single is It’s Now Or Never, with 5.42 million units sold. The track is also the seventh best-selling single of all time. Second to Elvis in the most physical copies sold is Frank Sinatra with 95,250,000 units sold. My Way was his best-selling single of all time with an impressive 989,000 sales. And coming in third is Michael Jackson on 79,350,000 physical units sold, with 27 million vinyl of Thriller included. The 1982 record is the best-selling album of all time with claimed sales of 70 million copies.
