Russian military officers are reportedly refusing to launch a new attack on the Ukrainian town of Vugledar after suffering heavy losses in a tank battle. It has been claimed that Russia lost around 130 tanks and armoured fighting vehicles in a recent offensive to take the town, located in the Donetsk oblast. Ukrainian military officers told the Kyiv Post that the Russian brigade refused orders to continue attacking the town. One was quoted as saying: "The leaders of the brigade and senior officers are refusing to proceed with a new senseless attack as demanded by their unskilled commanders - to storm well-defended Ukrainian positions with little protection or preparation." The Russian military is reportedly close to taking the town of Bakhmut, also in the east of Ukraine, but this battle has also exposed divisions within Russian ranks. Yevgeny Priogzohin, leader of the Wagner private military group, has accused Russian forces of withholding ammunition from them.  Prigozhin said: “I’m knocking on all doors and sounding the alarm about ammunition and reinforcements, as well as the need to cover our flanks. “If everyone is coordinated, without ambition, screw-ups and tantrums, and carries out this work, then we will block the armed forces of Ukraine. If not, then everyone will be s*****d." He also warned that the "front will collapse" of Wagner stops helping Russia. Prigozhin added: “If Wagner retreats from Bakhmut now, the whole front will collapse. The situation will not be sweet for all military formations protecting Russian interests.” FOLLOW EXPRESS.CO.UK BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES
