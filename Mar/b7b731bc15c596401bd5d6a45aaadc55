The 56-year-old joined Jessica Chastain on stage as they presented the Best Actor and Best Actress awards. Appearing at the 95th Academy Awards, Halle donned a gorgeous form-fitting white gown with statement golden roses and platform heels but showed off a lot less on Instagram. Documenting her preparation for the evening, the Monster’s Ball star shared a clip on Sunday as she stepped out of the shower. The actress whipped her hair around in a makeup-free and shirtless video to the tune of Michael Buble’s Feeling Good before having a good laugh at herself. Halle ecstatically wrote to her 8.2 million followers: “Guess who’s going to the ball tomorrow.”
