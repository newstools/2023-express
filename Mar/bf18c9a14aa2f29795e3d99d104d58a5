Tributes have been paid to a Jeremy Kyle Show guest who died "peacefully". Deon "Mad Dog" Hulse, who had a skull inked over his own face, reportedly died "peacefully in his sleep" last week. The tattoo fanatic was one of the controversial ITV chat show's most memorable guests, appearing in an episode titled "How Could My Boyfriend Destroy His Own Face?" back in 2011, reports Birmingham Live. Deon, from Walsall, West Midlands, who previously told Kyle: "I don’t care what I look like. I am who I am, if people don’t like me for who I am, they can do one," is said to have died on February 26, according to a GoFundMe page set up to "give him the send off he deserves". A post on the page said: "Hi all to everyone from Goscote, Bloxwich, Brownhills, even as far as Blackpool, many of you know Deon Mad Dog Hulse. "He touched a lot of people’s hearts, many of us will always have a story to tell about him. He was a one off, a one in a trillion. "As most know, Deon lost his life yesterday 26/02/2023, he died peacefully in his sleep. "I want to set up a GoFundMe just to help with his funeral to give him the send of he deserves. "I want to take the burden away from his loving family. He has left a lot of people heartbroken. "Every little bit helps, thank you everyone, let’s show the family how much he’s loved and Deon rest in pure paradise. "We all love ya kid."   Roxy's Pet Shop in Walsall also paid tribute to the self-confessed "family man and tattoo fan", with a Facebook post. Describing him as "one of the friendliest guys around", they said: "RIP Deon, our thoughts are with his family at this hard time." Other tributes on the post described him as "the best guy about", "friendly" and "polite". A balloon release was scheduled to take place in his memory on the car park of Home Bargains, Bloxwich, on February 28. So far, £340 has been raised towards the £2,000 target.
