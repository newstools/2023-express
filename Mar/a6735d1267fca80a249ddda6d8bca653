Suella Braverman pledged to end the "wave" of illegal migrants that are entering Britain, saying that the problem is costing the taxpayer £6 million per day. Giving a statement to the House of Commons today, she said the volume of illegal arrivals has "overwhelmed" the UK asylum system, warning that the UK has "seen a 500 percent increase in small boats crossings in two years." She vowed to stop the small boats crisis once and for all by deporting tens of thousands of people entering the UK illegally. The new legislation will stop asylum, modern slavery, and human rights laws being used by migrants who have breached Britain’s borders. In her statement to the Commons, Ms Braverman warned that "patience has run out" adding that the "law-abiding patriotic majority have said enough is enough". UPDATES TO FOLLOW...
