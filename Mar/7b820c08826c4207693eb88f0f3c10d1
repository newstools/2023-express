Melania Trump is the former First Lady and the third wife of Donald Trump, who is currently undertaking another bid for the American presidency after losing the last election to President Joe Biden. Fifty-two-year-old former model Melania has been noticeable in her absence recently. Fans of Melania have been left asking where she is amid Donald's campaign. She has missed a number of events during his run. The 76-year-old announced his candidacy on November 15, 2022, and has undertaken a number of visits since but Melania has been at none of them. This includes a recent visit to East Palestine, Ohio, where a toxic train derailment has devastated the town.

Now, however, Melania has started speaking out again after a months-long period of silence on her social media.
