Russia has “run down its current stock” of Iranian kamikaze drones, forcing Vladimir Putin to order his assaults on Ukrainian cities more sparingly, the British Ministry of Defence has claimed. In it’s latest update early on Wednesday morning, the MoD cited the 11-day gap between the two last known Russian drone attacks as suggestive of dwindling stockpiles, adding that Russia appears to have altered its launch site for the Shahed-136 one-way attack drones nearer to the Ukrainian border “to decrease time in the air over Ukraine”. In the last-reported round of drone strikes, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence confirmed it had shot down 11 Shaheds out of 14 launched on the night of February 27. Serhii Popko, head of Kyiv City Military Administration, reported nine of these were shot down in the vicinity of Kyiv airspace. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
