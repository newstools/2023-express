Queen Elizabeth's famous Paddington Bear sketch has a delightful link to her great-grandson Prince George, as his mother Kate, the Princess of Wales revealed the children's classic is one of his favourite films. While chatting with people at a post-BAFTA meet-and-greet with Prince William, Kate spoke about their children's favourite films, with some well-known Disney films also popular choices in their household. The Disney film Coco is also one of George's favourites, according to the princess, while William previously revealed his eldest son enjoys an older classic. The Prince of Wales said: "He quite likes The Lion King. We've watched that a few times." He added: "We've watched Octonauts several times. He has watched some Lego movies as well, so he's watched a lot of things like that." William is the President of BAFTA, with Kate saying of her son's film choices: "It's great obviously because of William's interest in film, it's great to have that father-son thing."  During a later trip to Northern Ireland, William was overheard saying his son had a new favourite, the Viking cartoon How To Train Your Dragon. His younger sister Princess Charlotte is also a Disney fan, as she was spotted dancing to the song We Don't Talk About Bruno from the film Encanto during a Jubilee trip to Cardiff. Prince Louis has not been left out of the Disney fun, as for his christening in 2018 his uncle Prince Harry splashed out on a very special gift for him.

The first edition of Paddington Bear was published in 1958, just five years after the late Queen's Coronation.
