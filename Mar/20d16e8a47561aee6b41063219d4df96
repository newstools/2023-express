The Bill the Government introduced is another important step to do all we can legally to stop the boats – by instantly detaining and swiftly removing those who enter the UK illegally. This in turn will help to deter people from unnecessarily risking their lives by making these dangerous journeys.  Over 45,000 people illegally crossed the Channel last year, putting huge pressure on public services – our schools and the NHS – and it isn’t fair to the British public. My constituents in Stoke-on-Trent North, Kidsgrove and Talke have repeatedly told me that they have had enough. I know many of my colleagues are receiving the same message, particularly given that hotels up and down the country are being used to house migrants, harming the hospitality and tourism industry communities and costing millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money. We are sending a clear message. If you come here illegally, you won’t be able to claim asylum. If you are removed, you will not be able to come back  Too often, we have seen plans to tackle illegal immigration, such as moving migrants to a safe third country like Rwanda, scuppered by the courts. Our new approach will limit the number of avenues available to challenge the Government. Let’s not forget that we voted to take control of our borders – and that is what we must do.
