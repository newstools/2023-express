Red Bull and Max Verstappen dominated the opening race of the 2023 F1 season with Mercedes and Ferrari struggling in Sakhir. Mercedes boss Toto Wolff has pledged the team will work on a new concept after failing to light up the leaderboards at the first event. It comes after the Silver Arrows finished a lowly P5 and P7, a worse result than the podium the team scored last season. George Russell has even admitted he feels Red Bull could win every race this season. The two Mercedes drivers then disagreed with each other after the race with Russell more pessimistic about the team’s chances. Meanwhile, Martin Brundle left laughing with a hilarious comment to Jeremy Clarkson ahead of the race. The Sky Sports pundit asked the former Top Gear host if he had been “milking chickens” after the success of the Clarkson's Farm documentary.
