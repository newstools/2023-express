Following 1995’s GoldenEye, Pierce Brosnan starred in his second James Bond movie Tomorrow Never Dies two years later. This time around 007 would team up with Chinese agent Wai Lin, played by Michelle Yeoh who is Oscar-nominated for her performance this year in Everything Everywhere All At Once. The 60-year-old Malaysian actress has gone on to star in some big Western movies, although right after Bond it was really difficult for her. Speaking with PEOPLE, Yeoh said: “The first movie I did after I came to America was Tomorrow Never Dies with Pierce Brosnan. James Bond at that point had only been known as macho, and the girls were just the ones with cutesy names.” The Malaysian star turned the idea of the submissive Bond girl on its head by not only saving 007’s life but also pushing away his sexual advances. After impressing audiences and Hollywood, the offers began coming in, but they weren’t quite what she was hoping for.

They would talk very loudly and very slow. I didn't work for almost two years, until Crouching Tiger, [Hidden Dragon] simply because I could not agree with the stereotypical roles that were put forward to me.” Her role in the latter would earn her first Best Actress BAFTA nomination, which was followed this year for Everything Everywhere All At Once.
