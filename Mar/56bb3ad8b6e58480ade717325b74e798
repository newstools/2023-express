Napoli superstar Khvicha Kvaratskhelia put another screamer in his catalogue on Saturday evening with a superb solo effort against Atalanta. The Georgian trickster could be the subject of an epic transfer battle between Arsenal, Manchester City and others at the end of the season. Kvaratskhelia burst onto the scene this campaign, having spent last term with Rubin Kazan in Russia and Dinamo Batumi in his homeland. It did not take Napoli fans long to realise that they had unearthed a gem for a bargain fee, thought to be less than Â£10million. The 22-year-old winger has 32 goal contributions in 33 matches across all competitions this season while catching the eye with formidable performances against Liverpool in the Champions League. He has also been integral in Napoli's push for the title, with their 18-point buffer unlikely to be clawed back. Arsenal are reportedly keeping tabs on Kvaratskhelia, while Man City are also touted to be in the hunt. He showed fans exactly why on Saturday with a mesmerising goal against Atalanta.  Don't miss...

By the time the ball crossed the line, an almost comedic crowd of seven white Atalanta shirts surrounded the youngster but none could get near him as Kvaratskhelia's latest wonderstrike elevated him closer to global stardom.

Suitors from the Premier League could have a tough job convincing the player, however, amid claims by his agent that Real Madrid is the ultimate dream. "[Kvaratskhelia's] father and I are Barcelona fans," said Mamuka Jugheli. "But Kvara loves Real Madrid. If I see him in a Barca shirt I'll be happy, but he is Madridista. The Napoli director has asked me not to be in a hurry - Kvara likes everything in Napoli."  Amir Rrahmani scored Napoli's second against Atalanta to push the Azzurri closer to a first league title since 1990. Kvaratskhelia could be joined by Osimhen in leaving the Italian giants this summer, providing the asking price is met. Manchester United are heavily linked to the Nigerian frontman, who leads the Serie A scoring charts by a five-goal margin this campaign. It remains to be seen whether Napoli would be willing to let both players leave in the same window.
