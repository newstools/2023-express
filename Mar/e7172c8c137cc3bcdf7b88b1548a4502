Lewis Hamilton has been tipped to walk away from Mercedes but is unlikely to join rivals Aston Martin. Sky Sports host Simon Lazenby said he could not rule out Hamilton walking away from the Silver Arrows in his desperation to win an eighth title. However, Karun Chandhok feels a move to Aston Martin would be off the cards despite the British squad making major strides for 2023. Alonso and Hamilton clashed when they partnered up at McLaren back in 2007. Furthermore, Chandhok stressed it was highly unlikely that team boss Lawrence Stroll would sack son Lance in order to bring in Hamilton. He has also warned the German manufacturer has just a month to decide on its long-term future after a disappointing Bahrain Grand Prix. Team boss Toto Wolff called for engineers to pursue a new concept after Saturday qualifying in Sakhir. However, Chandhok admits most squads will have to sign off on their 2024 packages within a month leaving Mercedes pushed for time to make a decision.
