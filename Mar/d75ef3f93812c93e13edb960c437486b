All eyes will remain on the Champions League knockout stages today after Chelsea's impressive comeback victory over Borussia Dortmund last night, with Tottenham in action against AC Milan later this evening. The north Londoners will go into the fixture behind on aggregate following their defeat at the San Siro last month but will be looking to emulate their cross-city rivals by overturning the deficit with at least two goals on home soil. Antonio Conte is expected to be back in the Tottenham dugout this evening, with the Italian having recovered from gallbladder surgery in time to lead his team by taking over the reins from assistant Cristian Stellini against AC Milan. However, it remains to be seen whether Conte's presence will be enough to inspire the club to a famous victory or if they will be sent crashing out of the Champions League by last year's Serie A winners in front of their own fans. Chelsea, meanwhile, will be relieved after finally winning again under Graham Potter for only the third time since the start of the new year and will be desperate to kick on by maintaining their newly-found positive momentum over the coming weeks. The Blues have struggled to get firing on all cylinders under the guidance of the former Brighton boss but will be hoping that Tuesday's victory over Dortmund will signal the start of a revival as they look to secure an unlikely top-four finish in the Premier League at the end of the season.
