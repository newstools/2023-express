A body has been recovered from the scene of a suspected gas explosion in Swansea that injured three other people and extensively damaged two properties. South Wales Police said a search at Clydach Road in Morriston discovered the body of a man who was previously unaccounted for, and his family has been informed. “An investigation will now get under way to establish the cause of the incident. The Health and Safety Executive has been informed,” the force said. It added: “A multi-agency command room is co-ordinating the emergency response to the incident at Swansea Central police station. “A rest centre has been set up by the local authority at Morriston memorial hall to support those affected.”  The explosion happened at 11.20am on Monday and two properties were extensively damaged, while other neighbouring properties were also damaged, and three people were taken to hospital by ambulance. “A cordon remains in place and people are asked to avoid the area. It is necessary to keep the cordon in place due to the ongoing risk to the public and the amount of debris which is blocking access roads,” South Wales Police said. “Clydach Road remains closed and traffic is being diverted. “A number of homes in the Cwm Arian area are currently only accessible via pedestrian routes near the Lidl supermarket and DFS store due to vehicle access off Clydach Road being blocked and concerns over the gas main which is currently being made safe by contactors on site.   “Once this work is complete, it will be possible to restore controlled vehicle access.” Superintendent Steve Jones said: “Our thoughts are with the family of the man who has lost his life and those affected by this tragic incident. “We are doing everything possible to reduce the impact on the wider community and allow access to homes as quickly as possible where it is safe to do so. “I would like to thank the community for the patience and support during what is a challenging incident.”
