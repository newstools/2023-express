NFL superstar Odell Beckham Jr is set to return this season after sitting out in 2022, as he recovered from an ACL tear suffered in the Super Bowl. Beckham has not played since the Los Angeles Rams' win over the Cincinnati Bengals 13 months ago, and struggled to get back to full health in time for the previous campaign.   On his day, Beckham remains one of the best receivers in the league, but has now suffered two ACL tears in the past few seasons, essentially missing two full seasons. This past week, the 30-year-old worked out for a dozen NFL teams, reportedly impressing in training and looking back his old self. He is expected to receive a few offers, but has named a surprisingly large asking price for any team to sign him.

Beckham reportedly came close to joining the Dallas Cowboys last year, but the team were unwilling to give him a long-term contract, something he had been seeking from the Rams. It's fair to say that his resume is deserving of a big payday, and if he's able to play at the level he had been with the Rams, a team could get a bargain in acquiring him. But with two ACL tears and at the wrong side of 30, it remains to be seen if Beckham will get the contract that he feels he deserves.
