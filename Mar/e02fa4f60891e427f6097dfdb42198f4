Former work and pensions secretary Chloe Smith has told Daily Express readers: “Your country needs you.” The Tory MP also urged Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to help get over-50s back into work.  At least 2.2 million working-age adults are not currently in paid employment because of ill health but hope to return to work in the future, research has revealed. During the pandemic, people aged 50 to 64 gave up work in their droves due to health issues, the fear of catching Covid-19, retiring early or caring for others. Chloe Smith, MP for Norwich North, said: “Express readers might be among them. Maybe you’re into your sixth decade and have decided you’re not looking for work any more. Maybe you’ve suffered a health problem and work is not easy to do. “Your country needs you. You’ve got so much to offer. Employers need your experience. The Chancellor is right to look at how the over-50s can be helped back into work.”  The number of “economically inactive” 50 to 64-year-olds taking early retirement has risen by over 300,000 since the pandemic. But policymakers are pulling out all the stops to get people back to work because of labour shortages affecting the economy. Ms Smith urged the Government to “bust the NHS” backlog in a bid to treat people who have a chance of returning to the workplace. She said: “Musculoskeletal problems and mental ill health are two widespread ­worries. As Jeremy Hunt correctly prescribes: ‘The NHS must help people into work’.” Ms Smith also called on the Chancellor to consider reforming benefits for disabled people and those with health conditions. She said: “The cost of having millions not in work is an appalling waste of opportunity.”
