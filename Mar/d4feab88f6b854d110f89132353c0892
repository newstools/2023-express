For customers frustrated by the upcoming broadband price hikes, there's a simple trick to get you free hyperfast broadband for free. All of the major Internet Service Providers (ISPs), such as BT, EE, Vodafone, Plusnet, Virgin and Sky are putting up prices in the coming weeks with some bills rising by as much as 14.4 percent. To beat these exorbitant price rises, Hyperoptic has announced a deal that offers three months of full-fibre broadband for free plus there is no activation fee to pay. As a quick reminder, Hyperoptic is a smaller ISP but still supplies broadband to over 800,000 homes. All of its plans are full fibre and come with unlimited data.  And it's not slow downloads that are being offered as part of the deals with Hyperoptic even dishing out its best 1Gbps plan as part of the offer.
