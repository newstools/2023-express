If you're trying and failing to access TikTok this morning you are not alone. Reports are flooding in that the video app is currently down and not working. In fact, Down detector, which monitors outages across the globe is currently showing over 8,000 reports that the app is offline - that number makes this a major outage. Speaking on its comments page, one Down Detector user called Nikita said: "TikTok appears to be broken, couldn't play video on repeat, I can still scroll." Along with that instant alert from Down Detector, Twitter is also full of fans rushing to find out if others are having similar issues. Speaking on the social media site, one user called @md88kai said: "TikTok is down. Nothing loading. Thought my wifi was the problem." Another called ChaoticArcadia, added: "TikTok’s down, world is gonna end." There's no word on what is causing the glitch or when things will be back online but Express.co.uk will continue to update this story as we find out more details. News of this outage comes as TikTok has just been banned by the EU. That means the app will no longer work on employees' smartphones. In an email sent to European Commission's employees, the Brussels executive urged staff to delete the Chinese social media app immediately. The email read: “To protect the Commission’s data and increase its cybersecurity, the EC [European Commission] Corporate Management Board has decided to suspend the TikTok application on corporate devices and personal devices enrolled in the Commission mobile device services."
