King Charles could not forgive Prince Harry's attacks on Queen Camilla, a royal commentator believes. Royal photographer Arthur Edwards thinks the "vicious" criticism and claims levelled at the Queen Consort by the Duke of Sussex in his recent interviews and memoir pushed the monarch to take the decision to take away Frogmore Cottage from Meghan and Harry. The commentator wrote in a comment piece for The Sun: "Finally the King has hit back at Harry and Meghan over their vicious attacks on his darling wife and Prince William." He continued: "The King has responded by taking away their grace and favour home, Frogmore Cottage, which was given to them as a perk of their job." Actions, Mr Edwards added, "have consequences". He added: "In any walk of life if you are not doing the job, you lose the perks. Harry and Meghan canâ€™t have their cake and eat it." News the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were asked to vacate their official residence in England broke on Wednesday. Royal biographer Omid Scobie reported sources claiming the Sussexes were left "stunned" by the decision, communicated to them shortly after the release of Spare in January. In the book and in interviews accompanying its launch, Harry claimed Camilla was willing to trade information with the press to improve her image. Speaking to US journalist Anderson Cooper in January, the Duke said what made the now Queen Consort "dangerous" was "the need for her to rehabilitate her image". He added: "That made her dangerous because of the connections that she was forging within the British press. And there was an open willingness on both sides to trade information and with a family built on hierarchy, and with her on the way to being Queen Consort, there was going to be people or bodies left in the street because of that."
