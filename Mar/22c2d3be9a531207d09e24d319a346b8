Meghan Markle and Prince Harry have been "snubbed by Hollywood" because they "lacked decorum", a royal expert has claimed. Support for the Sussexes, particularly in the US, significantly plummeted after the release of Harry's explosive memoir Spare and the couple's Netflix docu-series, Harry and Meghan. The couple seemingly thought they would be embraced by Hollywood but the claims, made by Harry regarding the Royal Family, have led the couple down a different road than they had planned. Harry and Meghan failed to receive an invite to any of the 2023 BAFTA events, with it being reported that the couple were "not welcomed" at the 2023 BAFTA Tea Party, hosted in Los Angeles last month. Despite them not being invited, the Prince and Princess of Wales were in attendance, with royal fans excited to see the couple on the red carpet. Speaking to Fox News Digital, royal correspondent and journalist Kinsey Schofield said: "I do think that Harry and Meghan expected more support from Hollywood than they have recently received." Ms Schofield added: "I think Harry and Meghan had an amazing opportunity to elevate themselves and actually be Hollywood royalty, but their decorum is making people think twice about the association".
