RSPCA has warned millions of dog owners antifreeze and rock salt are often poisonous to pets. With arctic temperatures spreading across the UK, the charity is urging people to do their bit to keep pets safe. Cold weather warnings are in place for much of this week, with some snow and sub-zero temperatures predicted. But it's important to keep antifreeze and rock salt out of the reach of pets, RSPCA stressed. Speaking to Liverpool Echo, RSPCA inspectorate commissioner Dermot Murphy said: "It’s really important we help our animal friends get through the chilly weather, and we’ve got lots of helpful advice and tips available for people to make sure their own pets, and local wildlife, are kept safe." If you’re concerned your pet may have ingested anything they shouldn’t, you should speak to your vet immediately. You should also dry any pets who get wet or cold, with a towel and make sure they have plenty of warm bedding. Mr Murphy added: "We don’t advise keeping dogs outside in any weather. Meeting the needs of dogs when they’re kept outside is very hard, and more so in very low temperatures. "We recommend bringing dogs indoors and if not possible ensuring their dog has permanent access to a clean, comfortable and dry sleeping area with a safe heat source so the temperature does not drop below 10C."
