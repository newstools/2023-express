Dame Deborah James’s final months will be shown in a “powerful and beautiful” BBC Two documentary. Bowelbabe: In Her Own Words will see the inspirational cancer victim talking frankly about her diagnosis and treatment. Mum-of-two and podcast host Deborah died last June aged 40. She had battled bowel cancer since 2016. The 80-minute film will feature unseen mobile phone footage, Deborah’s collection of TikTok videos, Instagram posts, You Me and the Big C podcasts, family videos and her voice notes. Commissioning editor Lucie Kon said: “Deborah worked with us on this film right up until the last few weeks of her life. “It’s an incredibly powerful and beautiful piece – emotional, intimate and unique.” Before her death, Deborah established The Bowelbabe Fund for Cancer Research UK, which raised more than £7million. The documentary will be shown on BBC2 and iPlayer this spring.
