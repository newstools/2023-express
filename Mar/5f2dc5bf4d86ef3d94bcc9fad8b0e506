The UK mobile network operator’s subtle upgrade to its 4G-based Pay As You Go (PAYG) plans means customers who joined from March 1 2023 will have their mobile broadband speeds capped at just 25Mbps. A brief update to EE’s small print was spotted by the team at ISPreview earlier this week. It reads: “Customers joining EE on a Pay As You Go Plan from 1 March 2023 will have their speed capped at 25Mbps.” EE advertises 25Mbps as “superfast speeds”. But broadcasting regulator Ofcom and the Government define a “superfast” broadband connection as speeds of 30Mbps upwards. Anything less than 30Mbps and above 10Mbps is instead classed as “decent broadband”. And customers are far from happy about this. One EE customer posted on the ISPreview Forum: “All new customers joining EE pay as you go from the 1st of March will now have their speed capped at 25Mbps. I can't help but think this makes zero logical sense?”  This may affect you if you picked up anything from the Nokia C21 Plus to the Samsung Galaxy A04s after March 1. But what can you do with 25Mbps? Speeds of up to 25 Mbps should be able to give you a comfortable web surfing experience, email, social networking, and moderate video streaming. According to Netflix, you only need 5 Mbps to stream full HD content and a data rate of 25 Mbps download speed minimum for 4K Ultra HD content.
