The NFL Draft has become one of the most anticipated events in the calendar where all 32 teams aim to retool their roster with the hottest young talent in the sport. Kansas City, Missouri will get the hosting honours this year for the first time since the NFL Draft’s inception in 1936 as the Chicago Bears look to trade down from their number one position. The first round of the draft gets it's own night on Thursday, April 27, though UK viewers will have to stick it out until the early hours of Friday morning to get a glimpse of this year’s top prospects. Round one will commence at 1am on Friday ahead of rounds two and three at 12 am on Saturday, April 29. The final four rounds are set to begin at 5pm later that same day. Don't miss... Chicago Bears to trade No.1 draft pick with NFL teams on high alert [LATEST] The NFL Draft will be shown live on Sky Sports NFL and Main Event, with coverage starting Thursday, April 27. The first pick is expected to be announced at 1am in the early hours of Friday morning. The Houston Texans’ week 18 victory over the Indianapolis Colts handed the Bears the first overall pick in the upcoming draft, though they are expected to trade down the order as other teams in a less fortunate position at quarterback seek to snatch a ball player at the top of the Draft.  With a number of promising players at the QB position grabbing headlines for their performance in the NFL Draft Combine, reports suggest several teams are ‘scrambling’ to trade for the Bears spot and grab the likes of Bryce Young or C.J. Stroud. Should the Bears keep faith with Justin Fields and trade their pick it will be the first time a franchise has traded down from the coveted spot since 2016 when the Los Angeles Rams swapped places with the Tennessee Titans to bag Jared Goff. As things stand, the Houston Texans, Arizona Cardinals, Indianapolis Colts and Seattle Seahawks complete the top five picks.
