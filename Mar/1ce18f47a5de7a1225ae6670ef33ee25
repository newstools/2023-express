Constance Marten and Mark Gordon have been charged with gross negligence manslaughter after officers discovered the remains of a baby in a wooded area in Brighton, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has said. Announcing the news today, Barry Hughes, chief crown prosecutor for CPS London North, said the couple is also charged with concealing the birth of a child and perverting the course of justice. He added that the charges arise from the couple's initial arrest on Monday, February 27. Mr Hughes said: “The CPS has authorised the Metropolitan Police to charge Constance Marten and Mark Gordon with gross negligence manslaughter. “Constance Marten, aged 35, and Mark Gordon, aged 48, have also been charged with concealing the birth of a child and perverting the course of justice. "These charges arise from their arrest on Monday as a result of a lengthy police investigation to establish their whereabouts and that of their baby. “The Crown Prosecution Service reminds all concerned that criminal proceedings against Constance Marten and Mark Gordon are active and that they have the right to a fair trial.” The pair will appear in custody at Brighton Magistrates’ Court on Friday, March 3. Hundreds of officers from the Sussex and Metropolitan Police services descended on the Hollingbury area of Brighton this week to search for traces of the child following the couple's arrest. Ms Marten and Mr Gordon were detained near Stanmer Villas in Brighton on Monday night following a seven-week search. Police found the couple following a tipoff from a member of the public, but they were without their child and did not reveal the baby's location. On Wednesday evening, police officers discovered the remains of a child, with search leaders saying officials would carry out formal identification. A post-mortem examination to determine how the child died will take place on Friday, March 3.
