The sandals seemed to be made of leather and Charlotte's toes were on show. Don't miss...

User @h_k_bend wrote: "This is a nice balance of pattern in the coat paired with a neutral dress, but the shoes add the fun colour and edgy modern look. A great example of how accessories can change classic looks." User @ellainthecityboston added: "Charlotte looks very chic and true to her own style."
