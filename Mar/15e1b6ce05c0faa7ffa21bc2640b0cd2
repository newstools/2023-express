The American series sees a pair of strangers forced to survive together in testing conditions, all the while unclothed. As the TV fanatics on Gogglebox watched in horror, the two contestants in the reality series celebrated after they had succeeded in murdering a snake. They called each other "a hero" after finding the snake and brutally killing it using a stick. Gogglebox favorites Jenny and Lee screamed as the scene played out, and at first, the snake seemed to be escaping.
