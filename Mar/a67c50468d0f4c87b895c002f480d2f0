Nicole Kidman's fans took to social media and addressed her bizarre antics on the red carpet at the 95th Academy Awards on Sunday night. She wowed at the ceremony as the actress donned a tight dress with a thigh-high split. The 55-year-old put on an effortless display in the sequinned number that cinched at her waist and paired the look with simple black ankle-strapped high heels elongating her long legs. She wore her sleek blonde tresses with her signature middle parting as her long locks cascaded down her back. The age-defying beauty posed confidently for photos before packing on the PDA with her husband Keith Urban. But some fans appeared concerned by her behaviour as one Twitter user quizzed: "Is Nicole okay?? Serious question." Another joked: "One thing about Nicole Kidman there is something wrong with her we just don't know what. And that's part of the appeal." Nova added: "They always make out."
