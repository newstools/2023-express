Rihanna, who performed her emotional song Lift Me Up, took to the red carpet ahead of the star-studded event. The Work hitmaker arrived on the Oscars' champagne-coloured carpet with her baby bump proudly on display - her first high-profile public appearance since last month's Super Bowl. The singer, who was nominated in the awards' Best Original Song category, donned a sheer, form-fitting gown. The proud mum rocked a leather bra and maxi skirt combo that featured a sheer turtleneck. Rihanna wore her hair in a stylish updo and completed the eye-catching look with pops of bright red on her lips and nails.
