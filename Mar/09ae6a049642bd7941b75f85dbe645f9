A mother has been jailed after chasing the rider of a stolen motorcycle and knocking him off - causing fatal injuries. Kerry Fair, 39, pursued Thomas Maguire after he took a Yamaha belonging to one of her daughters' boyfriends. A court heard Fair performed a U-turn in her Ford Focus and reached speeds of 86mph in a 30mph zone in the pursuit.  Mr Maguire was knocked off the motorcycle following a collision with the Ford Focus and Fair fled the scene in Kingstanding, Birmingham. The 30-year-old man died three weeks later and Fair was charged with his manslaughter, Birmingham Crown Court heard. The mother was found guilty of manslaughter on Tuesday, reports Birmingham Live, and will be sentenced next week. West Midlands Police said she deliberately pursued Mr Maguire, after being told he had stolen the bike hours earlier in May last year.  The defendant, of Oscott, Birmingham, abandoned the Focus on the side of the road where officers later discovered it with a steering lock on and the engine still running. Mr Maguire was taken to hospital by his friends where he remained in a critical condition for three weeks. He died on June 9 as a result of his injuries. Fair will be sentenced on March 14. Detective Inspector Michelle Thurgood, of West Midlands Police, said: "At the speed she was travelling, at the very least she was reckless to the fact Thomas would be injured as a result of her actions that night. "Had Fair applied emergency braking when she realised she was gaining rapidly on the motorbike, the collision could have been completely avoided which inevitably could have prevented Thomas from being injured. "Our thoughts remain with the family of Thomas and I hope today’s verdict can bring them some closure."
