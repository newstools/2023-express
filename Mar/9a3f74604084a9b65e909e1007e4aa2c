From period dramas such as Bridgerton and Pride and Prejudice, to fantasy epics like Game of Thrones, National Trust properties across the UK have played a starring role in some of the biggest film and TV series of modern times. Now you can explore some of these remarkable locations free or at a major discount, as many of the Trust’s historic houses, castles, and gardens are throwing open their doors to celebrate National Lottery Open Week. From March 18-26, you can use your National Lottery ticket to get free entry or special offers* at these, and hundreds more National Lottery-supported attractions. If music is your thing, wander around the childhood homes of John Lennon and Sir Paul McCartney in Liverpool and see where it all began for the Fab Four. Head to Cornwall to visit the Eden Project, home to the world’s largest indoor rainforest, whose futuristic biomes featured in the James Bond film Die Another Day. Plane spotters will love Scotland’s National Museum of Flight, which includes the nation’s own Concorde. Celebrate spring with a trip to Conwy Nature Reserve in Wales – a birdwatcher’s paradise where you might spot sedge warblers from Africa and goldeneyes from Russia among the 220 different species that have been recorded here. Or spend Mother’s Day at one of the 23 English Heritage venues taking part, such as Belsay Hall.
