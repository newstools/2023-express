A man allegedly shot and killed his 15-year-old daughter and three others. Officers said they were alerted to the nightmare crime when a child called a relative for help. Kiara Terwilliger, 15, and her mother Constance Terwilliger, 35, along with Glenda Terwilliger, 63, and Michael Watson, 36, were all killed in the incident. Sheriff Wayne Ivey said during a Wednesday press conference that while four people were killed, two children, six and nine, were also found unharmed inside the home. Deputies were called to the scene around 2am after receiving a 911 call from someone claiming one of the uninjured children inside the home had contacted them about the shooting. "Something like FaceTime, or something of that nature, through video contact, the small child told the reportee what had taken place and what they had seen at the house," Ivey said. "[The caller] kept the child on the video the entire time as they were concerned for the child's safety.‚Äù According to the sheriff, the suspect was identified as Domenico Gigante, 36, of Rockledge, Florida. He was the father of Kiara, and previously in a relationship with her mother, Constance. "I'm going to tell you that this is an extremely violent individual with an extremely violent past dating back as far as 2005, who should have never been on our streets, where he could take the lives of this entire family," Ivey told reporters.
