Another rip-roaring weekend of Premier League action has come to an end with Manchester United and Liverpool both failing to win their respective games in spite of their best efforts. The Red Devils were held to a goalless draw by basement boys Southampton on Sunday while Liverpool were surprisingly beaten away at Bournemouth just six days after thrashing United by seven goals in arguably one of the biggest shocks of the entire campaign to date. United will be sweating over the fitness of Alejandro Garnacho over the next few days after the young winger was forced off with an injury during the closing stages of Sunday's game against Southampton. He was seen leaving Old Trafford on crutches and it would represent a huge blow for Erik ten Hag if the 18-year-old is ruled out for any length of time, with United's squad already threadbare in the attacking department as things stand. Meanwhile, talks are continuing between Gary Lineker and the BBC with a view to reinstating him after director general Tim Davie apologised to licence-fee payers over the disruption to the channel's football programming over the weekend. Discussions are believed to be moving in the right direction but not all issues are said to have been fully resolved just yet, with further talks set to be held on Monday.
