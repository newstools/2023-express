Carol Vorderman, 62, opted for another figure-hugging ensemble to promote the latest episode of her quiz podcast, Perfect 10. The brainbox wore skintight red trousers paired with a vibrant jumper and her blonde locks were styled into loose waves. Carol added some height with knee-high black boots and strutted her stuff for the camera. In the comments, dozens of her adoring fans praised her latest look, including Alan who said: "You are incredible," and Alex exclaimed: "You are a perfect 10!" Ian echoed: "Red hot," while Mark gushed over the "lady in red".
