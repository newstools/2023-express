Cindy Crawford took to Instagram today to discuss her jaw-dropping red look from the 1991 Oscars. The dress has gone down in history, with the supermodel sharing how she found the ensemble. Sharing a number of throwback snaps with her 7.3 million Instagram followers, the mother-of-two said she had worn something similar on the catwalk. "1991 at the 63rd #AcademyAwards — wearing @versace," she captioned her uploads. Cindy continued: "It was actually the first time a Versace gown had ever been worn on a red carpet. I had walked their runway in a similar dress so when I found out I was going to the Oscars, I asked Gianni if he could make it in red… He said, 'Yes,' and the rest is fashion history."
