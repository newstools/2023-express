As another weekend of Premier League action approaches, coaches will sit down with the media for their press conferences across Friday. Off-the-pitch happenings and brewing summer transfer news should make for another busy news day in the football world. The big news emerging from Thursday evening is that Barcelona will be slapped with a costly transfer ban, preventing them from completing business this summer. They must raise £178million to do so, which could open the door for Manchester United to return for Frenkie de Jong. United are also in the market for a new star striker. Harry Kane could be available after FA Cup defeat to Sheffield United left Tottenham Hotspur on the verge of another trophy-less season. And Gary Neville has told the England captain his 'only option' if he leaves the Lilywhites. Meanwhile, Arsenal continue their pursuit of a first Premier League title since 2004, opening up a five-point gap over Manchester City on Wednesday. The Gunners could be primed for a £15m bargain at the end of the campaign. Follow LIVE updates below...
