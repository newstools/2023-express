 On Tuesday night, the Like A Virgin singer shared “How my Purim went” with a backyard photoshoot. The mum-of-six posed ominously at sunset in a darkened garden, with a string of lantern lights providing a mystical backdrop. In the series of shots, Madonna dressed as “Kween Esther” in a black floor-length coat, thick black sunglasses, cane and a lace ski mask. Loyal fans were shocked as they clicked through her story to find a surprise appearance by her new boyfriend, also donning a ski mask, as they shared a passionate kiss. The singer mysteriously captioned the photo of her new love as: “Killers who are partying.” Josh is the 29-year-old owner of boxing gym Bredwinners in Manhattan according to the Daily Mail but lives a relatively low-profile life so not much more is currently known about him.
