Sheridan Smith's electrifying performance as Shirley Valentine has attracted a host of famous faces, including Amanda Holden, since it launched last month. Amanda and her mum were among those in the audience on press night when fans gave the star a token of their appreciation by hosting a standing ovation. Tearful Sheridan, 41, clasped her son Billy, who turns two this spring, tightly in her arms as she soaked up the applause. Her son seemed to be equally emotional as he stretched out an arm and waved to the crowds in his little Toy Story onesie, before planting a kiss on his mum's cheek. Sheridan, who first hit mainstream attention as Janet Keogh on Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps, has enjoyed decades of success in the industry before reaching this moment - and she was visibly moved by the love from the audience.
