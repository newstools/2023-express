King Charles has reportedly evicted Prince Harry and Meghan Markle from Frogmore Cottage, their residence in Windsor. Buckingham Palace let the Duke and Duchess of Susses know about the plan to take away the property from them just days after Harry's tell-all memoir, Spare, was published worldwide, it has been claimed. The extraordinary report added the keys to Frogmore Cottage have been offered to Prince Andrew, who is set to see his subsidy slashed in a cost-cutting move by the King, it was previously claimed. No matter whether the Duke of York chooses to make the cottage his new residence, Meghan and Harry will be expected to soon ship back to the US their remaining possessions left in England, the report also claimed. Meghan and Harry moved to California in mid-March 2020 and bought their own home in the summer of that year. Nevertheless, Buckingham Palace maintained at the time that Frogmore Cottage was their official residence in the UK, and the Sussexes used it as a base when they returned to Britain over the past few years. The Duke and Duchess were filmed going through and packing up some of their items and pictures in a clip included in their Netflix documentary Harry & Meghan. Harry also paid back the £2.4million taken from the Sovereign Grant used to renovate the cottage ahead of the Sussexes' move into the home. Commenting on the report of the eviction, a source told The Sun: "This eviction surely spells the end of Harry and Meghan’s time in the UK. Andrew is resisting the idea of moving into Frogmore Cottage after he was offered it last week. But it shows Harry and Meghan are powerless to stop the eviction."
