German authorities said they will not file charges against Madeleine McCann’s primary suspect Christian Brueckner this year amid a lack of evidence to bring charges against him. Lead prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters said he is convinced they will have enough evidence to charge the German paedophile next year. Mr Wolters told Portuguese daily Expresso: “The investigation is ongoing but it’s going to take much longer. "Perhaps we won’t finish this year." He declined to give the reasons for the delays or further details about the case, arguing he does not want to "share the results or the current state of the investigation".   His comments echo his claims back in October, when he told Express.co.uk that the investigation will not reach a conclusion this year (2022).   The suspect was detained by German police in the city of Braunschweig in 2020 and late identified as a murder suspect in the McCann case by Portuguese officials in June 2020. The German prosecutor has since tried to collect enough evidence to charge Mr Walters. The public prosecutor's office in Braunschweig said at the time Brueckner is accused of five offences between 2000 and 2017 in Portugal unrelated to Maddie's case. Mr Brueckner has denied involvement in the youngster’s disappearance. He has since been charged with three counts of rape and two counts of child sexual abuse in separate cases. Despite being charged with offences near where Maddie disappeared, the German prosecutor said whether Mr Brueckner has anything to do with the disappearance of Madeleine McCann will be judged "completely independently of the current charges". Madeleine was on holiday in a holiday apartment in Praia de Luz in Portugal when she disappeared aged 3. Madeleine's whereabouts remain unknown. German prosecutors believe she is dead.
