Aaron Rodgers already looks to have gone back on his own word this off-season ahead of his reported move to the New York Jets. The quarterback has seemingly been looking to move on from the Green Bay Packers since the end of the 2022 season, a disappointing one with the team missing the playoffs. Since then, the Packers have indicated that they will look to start Jordan Love, after drafting him with a first-round pick in 2020, finally moving on from Rodgers after multiple seasons of rumours. The Jets and Packers have reportedly agreed to terms for a deal for Rodgers, but the quarterback is yet to make a decision on if he wants to join the team - having a no-trade clause. Neither the Jets or Packers have made a signing in the early stages of the free agency window opening, as they await Rodgers' call. This seems to already appear to be going back on Rodgers' comments which he made just two months ago, claiming he would not hold a team for ransom. At the end of the season when the Packers missed the playoffs, Rodgers said:Â "At some point, the carousel comes to a stop and it's time to get off, and I think you kind of know when that is. "And that's what needs to be contemplated. Is it time? Also, what's the organization doing? That's part of it, as well. But the competitive fire is always going to be there. I don't think that ever goes away. Sometimes it gets transferred, I think, to other things that might not ever fill that large void. "But like I said, I feel good about what I've accomplished in this league and wouldn't have any regrets walking away. But I got to see what it feels like once I get away from this." The Jets have already missed out on Derek Carr and Jimmy Garoppolo, who they had shown interest in, and will hope that Rodgers signs. Should he not, their off-season could already be tarnished.
