The Dancing on Ice final will see gymnast Nile Wilson, RuPaul's Drag Race UK winner The Vivienne, and The Only Way is Essex star Joey Essex compete on the ice in a bid to be crowned champion. But who do you want to win? Vote in our poll.  After a double elimination in the semi-final which sent The Wanted’s Siva Kaneswaran and Coronation Street star Mollie Gallagher home, just three celebrities remain in the competition, hosted by Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby. On Sunday, March 12, Nile, The Vivienne, and Joey skate with their professional partners to win over the public and be named as 2023 champion. Nile and his partner Olivia Smart received the first perfect score of the series in the semi-final and are the favourite to win the show, with odds of 1/5, according to bookmaker PaddyPower. Last week, Joey and Vanessa Bauer scored their highest mark of the series – 38 out of 40 — but found themselves fighting for their position in the competition.

Despite this, they are second-favourites with odds of 5/1. The Vivienne was the first drag queen to appear on the ITV show and has avoided the skate-off with partner Colin Grafton. Despite a strong performance throughout, the pair's odds are 8/1. The celebrities will be tasked with performing more spectacular routines alongside their recreation of the Bolero.
