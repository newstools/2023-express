After months of anticipation the first Grand Prix of the new F1 season will finally take place in Bahrain this afternoon. For two-time title winner Max Verstappen it was very much business as usual during qualifying, with the Dutchman claiming pole for Red Bull ahead of his teammate Sergio Perez. Mercedes star Lewis Hamilton will start from seventh on the grid, and he did not exactly seem too impressed with his new car, calling it "average" and saying it "didn't feel alive" after qualifying. There are renewed worries that it could be another long and difficult season for Mercedes, and their struggles come after Sky Sports reporter Ted Kravitz suggested that not all the team were "singing from the same hymn sheet". Nevertheless, Hamilton and his teammate George Russell will be desperate to prove the doubters wrong in the Middle East this afternoon, and it will be fascinating to see how things go as racing finally returns.
