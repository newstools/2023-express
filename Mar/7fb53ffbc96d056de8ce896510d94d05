 Levi McConaughy was joined by his younger sister Vida, 12, as they surprised their model mother during Paris Fashion Week. The family made a sweet trio as they attended the Stella McCartney show all dressed in beige and off-white outfits. Levi sported some plaid sweatpants and a matching jacket with a stylish blazer, his younger sister sported a flowing midi-dress with some warm slippers. The former model, Camila Alves, sported an effortlessly stylish ensemble showing off her toned midriff just days after sparking concern over their trip to France. Levi has garnered his own share of support recently from the McConaughey fanbase after his father revealed some brutal surfing injuries he had suffered.
