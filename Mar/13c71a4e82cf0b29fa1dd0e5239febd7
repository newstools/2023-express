Prince Harry has said the release of Spare has left him feeling "incredibly free" in a live interview with trauma therapist Gabor Maté. The Duke of Sussex was speaking two months on from the release of his bombshell memoir.    The 38-year-old said he "feels great" now that the tell-all book is out. He added: "I felt a huge weight off my shoulders." Picking up on Harry's newfound "freedom", the 79-year-old Maté noted: "Freedom is actually a big theme in your book. And it comes up a number of times." The Hungarian-Canadian reflected that fame can liberate people, but fame as a royal is the opposite.
