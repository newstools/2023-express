F1 returns this weekend with the second round of the championship from Saudi Arabia’s Jeddah Corniche Circuit. Max Verstappen heads to Jeddah in the best possible shape after Red Bull dominated the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix. Meanwhile, Mercedes have it all to do after a difficult weekend in Sakhir saw team boss Toto Wolff urge his mechanics back to the drawing board. Lewis Hamilton’s frustration at the Silver Arrows' success is clear to see with the seven-time champion pointing the blame at bosses last week. The Mercedes star claimed the team didn't listen to his ideas and decided to stick with the same concept which plagued the squad last season. It has led many pundits to wonder if Hamilton could quit the German manufacturer to ensure he secured his eighth crown. Meanwhile, Ferrari are also struggling after Charles Leclerc suffered a mechanical failure last time out. Team boss Frederic Vasseur is apparently “fed up” with reports suggesting he is failing to wield his influence in his new role. Italian media writes that Vasseur is not “pulling the strings” with allegations there is unrest behind the scenes.
