Now in its ninth week, Dancing on Ice will come to an end this Sunday as one celebrity will be crowned the winner of the 15th series. Although Joey Essex has been wowing the judges throughout the competition, body language expert Darren Stanton explained why the reality star may struggle to outperform his two competitors. Throughout the competition, Joey Essex, The Vivienne and Nile Wilson have consistently remained towards the top end of the leaderboard.Last Sunday during the semi-finals, ITV viewers saw Olympian Nile secure the first perfect score of the series as he was awarded 10s across the board from the judging panel.Not far behind was former TOWIE star Joey Essex who managed to get 38 for his emotional skate with professional skating partner Vanessa Bauer.However, his high score wasn’t enough to keep him out of the skate-off against The Wanted’s Siva Kaneswaran and Coronation Street’s Mollie Gallagher.

Joey has been a strong contender and it’s obvious he and his partner Vanessa share a strong bond and deep connection.“The duo have displayed a great resilience, passion and rapport throughout the series, but I can’t see the pair lifting the winning trophy this year. “Analysing his semi-final performance, Joey doesn’t seem to be as determined as he once was, with the fire he had to win not being as present as it previously has been. “Whether that’s due to him feeling fatigued as the competition draws to a close, if he doesn’t find the right energy for his final performance, it could dampen his chances of beating out his co-stars and taking the win.”However, the body language expert does believe it’ll be gymnast Nile who will be crowned champion due to his consistency and denomination from the offset.Darren added: “He and partner Olivia consistently show great eye contact, reciprocal liking and genuine emotion.

Admitting retirement had been tough, Nile confessed it resulted in him partying, drinking and gambling.Nile revealed once he started to open up, the weight had been lifted off of his shoulders.After their skate, the judges were blown away by their routine as they awarded the duo a perfect score of 10.Judge Oti Mabuse said: “For me, honestly I want to thank you. I want to thank you for being on the show.“For always every week pushing yourself but also speaking out about mental health and letting us see you for who you are because that was just delivered to perfection, so well done.”Dancing on Ice finale airs on March 12 on ITV from 6:30pm
