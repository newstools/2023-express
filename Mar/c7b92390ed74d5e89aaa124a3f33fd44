Prince Harry is likely to be completely snubbed in King Charles's will, a royal commentator has claimed. Daniela Elser said the Duke of Sussex and his uncle, Prince Andrew, are united by "some very bad news about wills". Ms Elser, in an op-ed for the New Zealand Herald, argues Andrew's reportedly not receiving anything from the late-Queen Elizabeth II's will is a sign of what Harry could face. She says during the early 1990s, Elizabeth II decided to the Royal Family would pay tax, but struck a deal which stipulated that money passing directly from one sovereign to another would not be hit with 40 percent inheritance tax. The commentator says: "And that, obviously, has huge possible implications for one Prince Harry, whose brother Prince William could therefore very well inherit everything from Charles. "This inheritance situation only exacerbates further the already canyon-sized gap that exists between William and Harry when it comes to moolah." She claims the irony of this situation is that Harry is in "much more need" of money, having "fled the palace coop". But Ms Elser adds Harry could benefit from a similar settlement to the one Elizabeth II provided for Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward while she was alive. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES
