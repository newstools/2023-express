A flight explosion tragedy was averted after the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) found a bomb in a checked-in bag. Mark Muffley, 40, carried a small device in his bag which set off an alarm as it was being screened by TSA. TSA agents uncovered the device, found it was filled with a powder and had two fuses covered with wax paper and plastic wrap. Muffley, from Pennsylvania, was due to board an Allegiant Air flight at Lehigh Valley International Airport bound for Orlando on Monday. He was paged over the airport's public address system but quickly fled the scene.

An Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) spokesperson told CNN: "The FBI arrested Mark Muffley, 40, without incident at his Lansford, Pennsylvania residence late Monday night." The criminal file said: "The baggage also contained a can of butane, a lighter, a pipe with white powder residue, a wireless drill with cordless batteries, and two GFCI outlets taped together with black tape." An airport spokesman revealed the device was detected shortly after 11am on Monday. The west side of the main terminal was shut down as a result. The device was removed and the terminal eventually reopened at around 2pm.
