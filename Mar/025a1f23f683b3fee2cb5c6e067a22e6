Juju Smith-Schuster’s elaborate skit mocking the Philadelphia Eagles - the side they defeated in Super Bowl LVI - that included jibes aimed at Jalen Hurts, James Badberry and AJ Brown appears to have escalated what is turning into an extraordinary beef. Eagles receiver Brown snapped back at the video and sent a warning to the Chiefs man in a series of messages that have since been deleted. “You really need to find you somebody else to play with,” the 25-year-old Brown tweeted to Smith-Schuster. “Don’t let that ring get you beat tf up.” Brown also appeared to directly message Smith-Schuster and wrote in part, “You better go to Cabo and enjoy your ring and stop [f******] w me.” The video in question, which heavily features Kansas City’s soon-to-be free agent, takes multiple shots at Eagles players and staff over their agonising 38-35 Super Bowl loss. Smith-Schuster directly references Brown in the video and also taunts the Eagles defence for “dropping the ball.” MUST READ NFL may respond to Jalen Carter after top draft prospect charged following fatal crash Smith-Schuster has seemingly been on a one-man mission to rub Eagles salt in the wounds as he had previously posted a Valentine’s Day note of Bradberry that read, “I’ll hold you when it matters most,” referencing the contentious penalty that effectively ended the game in the Chiefs favour. That barb attracted Brown’s first response. The former Tennessee Titan opted for a more magnanimous, even sarcastic approach when compared to his more recent retort.  “First off congratulations. Y’all deserve it,” he said on Twitter last month. “This is lame. You was on the way out the league before Mahomes resurrected your career on your 1 year deal Tik-Tok boy . He admitted that he grabbed you but don’t act like your like that or ever was. But congratulations again!” What the future of this feud holds is anyone’s guess but if the previous instalments are anything to go by, it’s sure to make for entertaining viewing.
