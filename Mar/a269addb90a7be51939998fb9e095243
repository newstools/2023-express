Kirsty Gallacher has admitted she “couldn’t cope with everything” after revealing she suffered a “breakdown”. The presenter, 47, said she struggled after her divorce from former England rugby star Paul Sampson, which led to her collapsing at the Sky studios in 2016.  Kirsty and Paul, 45, who have two sons, married in 2010 but separated in 2015 – the same year she competed on Strictly Come Dancing, while also presenting on Sky Sports News. She said: “I couldn’t cope with everything and I also collapsed on Sky Sports. I didn’t know what was going on and I just collapsed. “I had a virus and was also having a breakdown. I’ve never really been told that, but I know I was because I know what was going on in my head. “I wanted to run away, I was in pain. The person I look back at makes me very sad, but luckily it’s not the person I am now. “When I was doing Sky Sports News on a regular basis, I was going through all the pain of what Iwas going through as a single mum as well as the divorce, and I was doing Strictly.  “I was a wreck, skinny as a rake, I was running on empty. “Running literally from dance rehearsal in the morning to Sky Sports News, then training at night and then doing live shows. It was more than exhausting, emotionally and physically. I just felt like it was a cauldron of emotion.  “I had a breakdown. I didn’t cope very well after that.” Kirsty – daughter of golfer Bernard Gallacher – told the MidPoint podcast: “It’s very hard when you’re in the public eye – you’re not going to tell everybody everything, because I want to protect my children, my family and myself a little bit. “I had to protect all the time.”
