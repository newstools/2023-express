Carol Vorderman, 62, looked just a fraction of her age as she flaunted her fabulous figure on This Morning today. Her youthful demeanour demonstrated that even for a maths whizz like Carol, the numbers simply weren't adding up. Time seemed to have taken its toll on neither her complexion nor her body as she modelled the all-red ensemble, consisting of a cosy polo neck jumper and tight-fit trousers, for the show. It might seem difficult to believe that it has now been more than 40 years since Carol's first-ever appearance on Countdown, but that was the milestone number that she recently celebrated. The sensational star was all smiles on the This Morning sofa this Friday - and it's unlikely that fans will see the last of her on TV any time soon.
