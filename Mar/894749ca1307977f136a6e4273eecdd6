A disabled woman says she is unable to afford eye drops and stomach medicine and is in debt since her energy bills had more than quadrupled. Wheelchair user Anne Vivian-Smith, 52, of Nottingham says she has been ''made to feel like a parasite.'' She adds: ''I have no hope at all for next week’s Budget.'' Campaigners hammered home the message that they are being “left out in the cold” as they shivered in chilly temperatures on Thursday to deliver a 60,000-signature plea to Westminster. Charities Scope and Age UK joined forces in a call, backed by the Daily Express, for a social energy tariff ahead of next week’s Budget. They posed with a giant light bulb balloon breaking through the roof of a Wendy house to demonstrate rocketing energy bills.  Jessica Leigh, of Scope, said: “Disabled people and the elderly are being left out in the cold by the Government. “They are in dire straits and forced to make impossible decisions like turning off the heating or skipping meals.”
