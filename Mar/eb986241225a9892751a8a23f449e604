Those wanting access to the ultimate downloads might want to take a look at Sky. The popular TV and telecoms giant has just revealed that it's finally bringing back the option for new customers to sign up and get ludicrously fast 900Mbps broadband. At that rapid rate, a full HD Hollywood blockbuster movie can be downloaded in under 40 seconds which is over 10 times faster than the current UK average. 900Mbps speeds from Sky aren't actually new with the company announcing the launch of this service last summer. However due to "capacity issues", Sky quietly removed this speedy plan from sale towards the end of last year with the firm saying: “Providing a fast and reliable service is our number one priority. We are currently optimising our network and have temporarily paused new sales of Sky Broadband Gigafast while we do this. Existing Sky Broadband Gigafast customers are not impacted." Those already signed up were able to continue using it but Sky stopped letting new customers access its fastest and best speeds. Many took to forum pages to disclaim their disappointment at not being able to upgrade their internet but, as spotted by ISPreview, that's all now changed with the 900Mbps downloads once again available for all new users.
