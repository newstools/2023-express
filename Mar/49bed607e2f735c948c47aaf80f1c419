Queen Camilla, who is expected to drop the "Consort" part of her title after King Charles's Coronation, was seen chatting away with Megan Barton-Hanson of Love Island this week. It's not typical for royals and reality stars to cross paths, but to celebrate International Women's Day this week, a glitzy reception was held at Buckingham Palace - and a whole host of celebrity names were present. Megan wore her long blonde locks loose and added a touch of red lipstick to her face, but covered up in a chic long-sleeved black dress for the occasion. Former Strictly Come Dancing champ Rose Ayling-Ellis, who made show history by becoming the first deaf contestant last year, was also present. Meanwhile, Happy Valley star Sarah Lancashire was also spotted chatting to Camilla, after the royal seemed to say she had been left gripped by the thrilling finale earlier this year.
