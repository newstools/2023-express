F1 veteran Fernando Alonso was dubbed 'Darth Alonso' by fans after scaring a Spanish television presenter with an impressive near miss. The 41-year-old won his first karting race aged seven before going on to have a successful F1 career and will start his 20th season in the series this weekend. During his karting days Alonso won the Spanish championship as a junior three times before moving on to Formula 3000 and quickly into F1. The veteran motorsport star showed he still has impressive karting skills during a television programme on Movistar Plus+. As part of the '#Vamos on wheels' television programme a new segment named 'The fastest lap of Fernando Alonso' will see celebrities challenge a time posted by the Aston Martin star.
