President Volodymyr Zelensky has vowed his country "will find the murderers" of a Ukrainian prisoner of war who was gunned down by Russian soldiers in a brutal 12-second video clip. The victim, a soldier named Tymofiy Shadura, was seen heard shouting "Glory to Ukraine" before he was murdered in cold blood. He is seen falling to the floor shortly before a voice is heard saying "Die, b**h" in Russian. Mr Shadura had been missing since February 3. Ukraine's foreign minister has called for the International Criminal Court to look into the footage, which has not been verified by authorities. Zelensky said in response to the video: "I want us all in unity to respond to his words, ‘Glory to the hero. Glory to the heroes. Glory to Ukraine.’ And we will find the murderers."
