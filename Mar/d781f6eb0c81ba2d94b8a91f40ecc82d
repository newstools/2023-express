Oti Mabuse, 32, has left ITV viewers speechless as she dressed to impress for the Dancing on Ice final. The former Strictly Come Dancing star slipped her hourglass figure in a maroon sparkling corset, highlighting her tiny waist and ample assets. She then showed off her toned pins as her corset was met with a maroon satin skirt, featuring a thigh-high slit. Meanwhile, host Holly Willoughby, 42, went for her usual glamorous look in a sequin-embellished silver gown. The This Morning presenter posted a short Instagram reel of her outfit on Instagram, prior to this evening's final.
