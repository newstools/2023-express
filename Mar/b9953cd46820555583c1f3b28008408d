The winner of the largest ever lottery jackpot, the huge $2bn California Powerball, has bought an incredible home, hidden away behind the Chateau Marmont for $25.5 million. Edwin Castro, the winner of the eye-watering sum, accepted a one-time lump payment of $997.6 million after winning the lottery in November last year. Now, he has snapped up what must be among the most coveted properties in the US. The gorgeous home sits in the Hollywood Hills and boasts five bedrooms and seven bathrooms across a whopping 13,500 square feet. The sprawling home, bought in what is reported to be the most expensive real estate sale in the Hills this year, with an infinity pool and a view of Sunset Boulevard and Downtown, sits above the Chateau Marmont hotel. Now Castro counts Hollywood royalty among his neighbours with singer Ariana Grande, actor Dakota Johnson and comedian Jimmy Kimmel living near by. Amenities in the home, originally listed for $30M, include a bar, a wine cellar, a game room, a cinema, and a gym with a hot and cold plunge pool. Outside, residents and guests can enjoy a spa, fire pits, and a designated barbecue area. An open kitchen boasts black granite counters, while the primary suite has a private balcony and spa-inspired bathroom. If Casto is a fan of automobiles, he now has a five-car showroom to display them in. On sunny days he has a rooftop deck to lounge on. After buying a $2 ticket and becoming a multi-millionaire, Castro has kept a relatively low profile. However, he did make a written statement. The lottery winner said: "As much as I am shocked and ecstatic to have won the Powerball drawing, the real winner is the California public school system. "The mission of the California Lottery, which is to provide supplemental funding for California public education — both public schools and colleges — makes this a huge win for the state." Castro's winning numbers were 10, 33, 41, 47, 56, and Powerball 10.
