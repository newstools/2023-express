 A family was confused after seeing in their doorbell camera footage a jump out of his car before running into their garden to kick a snowman built by a nine-year-old girl. Before checking the footage, the mother and father from Dudley presumed the snowman had fallen over on its own.    They were left shocked by the man's “weird” behaviour as they saw the man launch a giant kick to the snowman, which sent it toppling to the ground. The family, who asked not to be named, has said the young girl who built the snowman is devastated. The mother said the man’s actions were “mean and horrible” and has said she wishes to find out the culprit. The father told Black Country Live that the bizarre actions were unbelievable and fumed about the incident.
