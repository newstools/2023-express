With winter temperatures set to continue into March, shoppers have discovered an Amazon product that helps them keep warm without splashing out on expensive heating bills. With electric blankets gaining popularity last year, Brits have been using them to get through the winter months during the cost of living crisis.   With an easy plug-in LED controller, the blanket has 10 heat settings to switch between, whether gentle warmth or full-on heat is required. The cosy flannel and sherpa material is designed to provide warmth even when the heating element is not in use, and is soft and gentle on the skin. The nine-hour auto shut-off function is ideal for giving peace of mind while in use, especially when being used in bed. There are eight colours to choose from, but the grey shade is reduced and is a neutral piece that would seamlessly fit into any decor style.
