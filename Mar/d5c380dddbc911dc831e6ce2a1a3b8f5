Memphis Grizzlies superstar Ja Morant has released a statement after he was suspended by the team after allegedly showing a gun on an Instagram live. Morant looked to have brandished the gun in his hands while reportedly at a strip club in Memphis hours after his team lost to the Denver Nuggets. The Grizzlies were quick to release a statement, suspending Morant for at least two games after they became aware of the video. A statement from the team read: "The Memphis Grizzlies announced today that Ja Morant will be away from the team for at least the next two games." In a statement, Morant said: "I take full responsibility for my actions last night. I'm sorry to my family, teammates, coaches, fans, partners, the city of Memphis and the entire Grizzlies organisation for letting you down. "I'm going to take some time away to get help and work on learning better methods of dealing with stress and my overall well-being."  The incident with Morant holding a gun comes just days after being accused of assaulting a teen last summer and brandishing a gun at them. Morant's live stream ended just moments after this, but fans had quickly screen-recorded and posted the video on social media, with it being viewed by thousands on Twitter. Earlier this week, the Washington Post alleged this week that Morant had assaulted a 17-year-old male, an incident his agent claimed was self-defence. In that incident, Morant was also said to have brandished a gun, something he and his representative, Jim Tanner of Tandem Sports, also denied. The incident was said to have occured at Morant's multi-million dollar mansion. And days after this report was released, Morant looked to have celebrated by using his fingers as a gun after a Grizzlies win, something he had been criticised for.
