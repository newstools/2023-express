The Green Bay Packers and New York Jets have reportedly agreed on a deal to trade Aaron Rodgers after multiple days of negotiating. Rodgers met with the team on Monday after being allowed to speak to another team to facilitate a move away from the Packers.   The quarterback and the Packers have been likely to move on since the end of the 2022 campaign, which ended in disappointing fashion with the team missing the playoffs. And with the Packers having first-round pick Jordan Love on the last year of his deal, the team are now seemingly keen to see him start, and could receive a huge haul of draft picks by trading away Rodgers. All the reports have suggested that Rodgers is 'open' to the move. The Packers have said that they will only negotiate with the Jets, and once again everything hinges on what Rodgers wants to do. And now, Jets insider reporter Connor Hughes has stated that a deal is 'essentially done'. He tweeted: "From my understanding on Jets & Aaron Rodgers: Everything that needs to be done is essentially done in regards to a trade. "Sides have worked out what needs to be worked out. So if Rodgers wants to be a Jet, he will be a Jet. Broken record, but â€¦ just waiting on him to decide."
