It's the final countdown for the current season of Fortnite, which is about to come to an end on PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, PC and Android. Epic Games has confirmed that Fortnite Chapter 4, Season 1 will end when downtime starts at 7am GMT UK time on the morning of March 10. Rather confusingly, Epic Games previously said that Chapter 1 would end on March 8. The company has since clarified that March 8 is the last full day to play the current season in all time zones. The news was announced by Epic Games on Twitter, alongside a teaser about what to expect from Fortnite "MEGA". "Made with precision," reads an Epic tweet. "Prepare for Fortnite MEGA - 3.10.2023." In a series of follow-up tweets, Epic also clarified any confusion about the true end date for the current season. "To clarify any confusion, we plan to go into downtime for Fortnite MEGA Chapter 4 Season 2 on March 10 at 2 AM ET," reads a follow-up tweet. "The last full day across all time zones of Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 1 is March 8." With Chapter 1 about to end, consider this your last chance to login and nab any elusive Battle Pass rewards. Sadly, it doesn't look like Epic is planning a big end of season event to usher in the next season. On the plus side, the company has some big plans in place to mix things up for Season 2. According to the early leaks, Epic will release at least two new Star Wars skins in the next season. Epic is also planning an Attack on Titan crossover, potentially for the Battle Pass. Elsewhere, first-person mode will make its long-awaited debut, alongside a new bike, weapons and lots more.
