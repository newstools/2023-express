A mother was sexually assaulted by a man while she was pushing her baby in a pram. During the attack, which took place in September 2021, the child fell out of the pram and sustained a minor injury. Damien Lawrence, 40, targeted the woman in Hanley Park, Stoke-on-Trent, before trying to drag another woman into an alleyway hours later. Lawrence, a paranoid schizophrenic, grabbed the first woman and put his hand between her legs before then targeting the second woman. He was later arrested and handed a hospital order under the Mental Health Act. Lawrence has been deemed unfit to stand trial. A three-day hearing last year found he had committed false imprisonment, sexual assault and battery. Judge Graeme Smith told Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court: "A jury found that you had committed a series of acts on September 7, 2021. "You sexually assaulted a woman who was walking in Hanley Park with her young child in a buggy. "You grabbed her and put your hand between her legs. She fell over. The buggy fell over. Her daughter fell out suffering minor injury. "That constituted an assault. She screamed. You ran off. "A little while later, a woman was walking home from work when she was grabbed from behind and had a hand put over her mouth. You tried to pull her towards an alleyway. She fought back and screamed. You backed off." The jury in the case found that Lawrence had falsely imprisoned the second woman and that he intended to go on and commit a sexual offence against her. Judge Smith added that she was "satisfied" that Lawrence suffers from mental illness and therefore it is therefore "appropriate" for him to be held in a hospital. He has accommodation at St George's Hospital in Stafford to "protect the public from serious harm".
