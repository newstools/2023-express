Sir Michael Caine was spotted leaving London private members' club, Oswald's, on Thursday evening as he kicked off his birthday celebrations. The iconic actor, best known for his roles in Zulu and The Italian Job, will turn 90 on March 14. Michael enjoyed a dinner with friends and was accompanied by his wife Shakira, 76. He looked dapper in a navy suit over a light blue shirt as he was assisted by staff when leaving the venue. Michael then used a walking frame as he made his way to a waiting car.
