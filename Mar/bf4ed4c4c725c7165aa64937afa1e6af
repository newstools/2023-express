The aftermath of the Bahrain Grand Prix is still running riot in the world of F1, and next week’s Saudi Arabian Grand Prix is sure to amplify emotions once more. Red Bull sent shockwaves through the championship last time, with Max Verstappen and Sergio Perez filling the top two spots on the podium, and already teams are fretting over how to lay a glove on them. Lewis Hamilton was unhappy with how Mercedes performed in Bahrain, and he wasn’t afraid to share his frustrations with the world. He and George Russell both suffered issues in the race, with Hamilton pointing the finger at the engineers. Mercedes have since tried to cool the situation and wrote an open letter to supporters to announce that they are dealing with the matter internally and have held talks about 'accountability'. With speculative rumours stirring that Hamilton could be keen to leave Mercedes in search of his eighth career title, Mercedes will push to settle the matter as soon as possible to prevent frustrations from brewing. Though Mercedes are not alone in being on the cusp of a major crisis, with Ferrari also reportedly experiencing several internal problems. Driver Charles Leclerc is said to have been the 'most displeased' with last weekend's poor performance and is desperate to speak with top chiefs to address the matter and understand how the team will close the gap on Red Bull. Things could go from bad to worse too, with several engineers reportedly handing out their resumes to rival teams in hope of exploring new options following the imminent exit of aerodynamics chief David Sanchez.
