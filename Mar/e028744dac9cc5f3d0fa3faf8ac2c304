Gary Neville has taken aim at Bruno Fernandes' attitude in Manchester United's humiliation at the hands of Liverpool on Sunday. United came into the match at Anfield in fine form and looking to keep up with both Manchester City and Arsenal at the top of the table.  The match was finely poised for most of the first half, but United soon crumbled in spectacular fashion and players began losing their heads. Fernandes appeared to be the worst culprit for letting the result get the better of him, waving his arms in disgust at officials for not giving fouls and letting his frustrations get the better of him throughout the second half. And Neville appeared to have enough of Fernandes' antics after the Portugal international tried to win a foul after a coming together with Ibrahima Konate. The Liverpool defender was carrying the ball out of defence with Fernandes racing up behind him to make a challenge. Konate then held out an arm to try and fend off the Portuguese star, who immediately fell to the floor clutching his face. Replays appeared to show that Konate's hand only touched Fernandes in the chest and Neville was far from impressed. "There was a VAR check for an elbow - it was on his chest," Neville said while watching the footage back. "Oh, he holds his face. That's embarrassing from Bruno Fernandes. "It's on his chest and he goes down. He's so frustrating at times." Speaking after Liverpool's sixth goal, Neville attacked Fernandes further with the United midfielder seen sulking in the middle of the pitch. He added: "Bruno Fernandes is stood in the centre circle with his arms raised saying 'why is not me coming off?'. "I have to say I think some of his behaviour in the second half has been a disgrace. I think he's been brilliant for Manchester United at times with his assists and goals."
