SNP MP John Nicolson has been pushed to apologise after he posted an "ignorant racail slur" on social media. The MP for Ochil and South Perthshire shared a video on Twitter prior to his appearance on BBC's Debate Night last night. In the video, he was being seen to by a stylist when he remarked that when politicians apply their own makeup "they go a bit overly brown, they tend to tandoori themselves". MSP Pam Gosal, who is of asian descent, wrote to Mr Nicolson to demanding he apologised and removed the tweet, which she dubbed “an offensive stereotype that I hoped we’d left behind in the 1970s”. The West of Scotland MSP said: “I can’t believe John Nicolson thought this ignorant racial slur was remotely appropriate."  The Conservative politician continued: “To use the term ‘tandoori’ in relation to brown skin colour is grossly offensive. "The subtext is clear: brown people eat curry. “It’s an offensive stereotype that I’d hoped we’d left behind in the 1970s, yet here we have a supposedly ‘progressive’ politician using it in 2023. “John Nicolson needs to apologise for his lazy and crude pigeonholing and remove this crass tweet.” Mr Nicolson has now deleted the tweet.  Twitter users, in large part, did not respond to Mr Nicolson's remark about politicians going "overly brown". However, one user, Henry Lacey, simply said: "Nice racist trope there." Another, David Riddick said: "We all know you are an arrogant and pompous person, but you have now added racism to your CV."
