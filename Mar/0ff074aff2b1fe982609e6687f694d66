The mystery passenger that escaped the fatal car crash in which three others were killed has be named. 27-year-old Joel Lia got out of the Volkswagen Tiguan before it hurtled off the road in Cardiff's St Mellons area. The crash, which police are still investigating, took place in the early hours of last saturday. It killed childhood pals Eve Smith and Darcy Ross, both 21, as well as Rafel Jeanne, 24. Sophie Russon, 20 and Shane Loughlin, 32, are in hospital and are fighting for their lives. South Wales Police told the Mirror that Mr Lia is acting as a witness. Rafel Jeanne's old school paid tribute to the "joyful" former pupil, who was a "sincere friend" and "well respected". The Volkswagen Tiguan he and the others were in left the A48(M) in Cardiff and hit trees in the St Mellons area of the city. The car was amongst the trees for 48 hours before police tracked it down, as family and friends worried about what had happened to the young people. Speaking about Joel, who escaped the incident, a source told the Sun: "He has been cooperating fully with the officers in the case and is understandably very upset by the events of that night". Joel had previously served a “lengthy” prison term for crack cocaine trafficking, reports the South Wales Argus.
