Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will be offered to stay at an apartment in Buckingham Palace when they visit the UK in the future, it has been claimed. The King is set to offer his youngest son a major olive branch after he issued the couple with an eviction notice for their current UK home, Frogmore Cottage. Palace sources told the Mail on Sunday that Harry and Meghan are set to be offered Prince Andrew's old suite in Buckingham Palace whenever they need it. They could also be offered St James's Palace, or even Princess Diana's former home at Kensington Palace, which lies empty and is currently being renovated. It comes after the King asked the couple to pack their bags and move out of their current UK residence in Windsor. He issued them the order 24-hours after Harry published his tell-all memoir Spare. The Sussexes have until later this year to vacate the five-bedroom property which was initially gifted to them as a wedding present from the late Queen. King Charles is understood to have offered the keys to Frogmore Cottage to his brother Prince Andrew, who currently resides in Royal Lodge with ex-wife Sarah Ferguson. But Andrew is said to be resisting the move as he doesn't want to downsize from his current 30-bedroom property. However, concerns have been raised that he will struggle to afford the property as the King may cut his Â£249,000 annual allowance. The Prince and Princess of Wales have been tipped to move into Royal Lodge with their three young children if Andrew does move out.
