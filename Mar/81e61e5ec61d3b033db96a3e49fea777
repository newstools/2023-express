Russians were urged to immediately take shelter and wear gas masks in a later-confirmed cyber attack on state media channels as the nation's war continues to rage in Ukraine. TV and radio programmes were interrupted in Moscow on Thursday with an urgent message to seek shelter, take anti-radiation pills and wear gas masks. The message was shown on TV with a black and yellow radiation symbol and a map of Russia slowly being covered in red. A Russian voice warned: “Urgent message. There was a strike. Urgently go to a shelter. Seal the premises. Use gas masks of all types.” The Russian emergencies ministry later blamed the fake nuclear message on a cyber attack on Russian state broadcasters.
