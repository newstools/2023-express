In an emotional Oscars night filled with tears from almost all the winners and many of the hosts, the Best Song category provided some welcome lighter relief. The competition was stiff with big hitters like Lady Gaga and Rihanna delivering powerful renditions of their numbers from Top Gun and Black Panther 2 respectively. But it was an irresistibly catchy and euphoric dance number from Bollywood which took home the golden statuette. And UK fans can enjoy the song and movie at home. SCROLL DOWN TO WATCH THE FULL NAATU NAATU ROUTINE IN RRR The song Naatu Naatu and its energetic dance routine brought the crowd to their feet last night in Hollywood. Composer M.M. Keeravani charmed the audience with his acceptance speech, much of it delivered in song to the tunes of his idols The Carpenters. Amusingly, some news outlets back home mistakenly ran articles declaring that he grew up listening to the music of carpentry professionals. He previously also explained that the song title means "Naatu means ethnicity, ethnic. Whatever I do is purely mine. It's my own experience, it's my own way of expression. These are my words, this is my style, look at me, this is who I am." The song itself also provides a lighter break in the movie, which is about a dramatic struggle for love and freedom in India set at the time of The Raj. RRR is an acronym for "Roudram Ranam Rudhiram," in the film's original Telugu language. It translates as "Fierce Death Blood," but the film marketing in English has translated it much more loosely to follow the three R's as "Rise Roar Revolt." The three-hour-long film fittingly features numerous high-octane scenes including fights with tigers, motorcycles being hurled and raging infernos.
