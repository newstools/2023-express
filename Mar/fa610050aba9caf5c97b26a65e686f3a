The Galaxy S23 Ultra is, without doubt, a contender for smartphone of the year. In our recent Galaxy S23 Ultra review, Express.co.uk gave this device a coveted "Rated" bag which means it's pretty faultless. Our only major gripe was the high price but things have just been made way more affordable thanks to a new hidden discount code which makes the best Galaxy S23 deals even better. Until now, the greatest discounts were reserved for those who had a device to trade in but Samsung is now dishing out a new price cut that's available even if you don't have a current phone you want to get rid of. When heading to the checkout, Galaxy fans can now use the S23SAVE code and get an instant £150 off. That drops the cost from £1,249 down to £1,099. It's still quite expensive but any money off will definitely make things seem a little more tempting. For those with an older Galaxy device in their pocket, there's more good news as customers can hand them over and use the code S23BOOST to get a whopping £750 off. That's a mega saving and could mean it's possible to grab the S23 Ultra for under £650 which is a massive bargain.

There's also a speedy new Qualcomm processor tucked under the hood and Samsung has refreshed the rear camera with owners treated to a 200-megapixel sensor that now shoots much better images at night. Tucked under the hood is a huge 5000mAh battery and an in-built S Pen stylus which lets you scribble on the screen without using your finger. It comes in three different storage sizes including 256GB, 512GB and 1TB plus there are four colour options - Graphite, Sky Blue, Lime and Red. Prices start from £1,249 but that can be reduced to just under £500 thanks to Samsung's latest deals. If you don't think you need the power of that Ultra model, don't panic. The standard Galaxy S23 and larger S23+ also have money off with that S23SAVE code dropping things by £100. That means you can instantly slash the price of the S23 to £799 and get the S23+ for £949.
