Prince Andrew has reportedly told friends he is considering another tell-all TV interview to clear his image and return to official royal duties. The Duke of York was forced to step down after a disastrous interview with BBC Newsnight in 2019 which forced him to step back from his roles. Sources close to the royal have claimed Andrew has warmed up to the idea of "telling his side" of the last two years of his life. The royal insider told The Mirror: "Nothing is off the table. Andrew has been made to give up his job and now potentially his home. “He feels there is little else to lose when he has already paid an awfully high price.” The insiders suggested the Duke of York is considering cooperating with a US broadcaster after taking notes from Prince Harry's promotional tour for his biography, Spare, earlier this year. The reports emerged a week after Fergie, Duchess of York met with US journalist Daphne Barak. Barak interviewed the partner of convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epsten, Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving 20 years in jail for sex trafficking. Prince Andrew's relationship with Epstein was the main subject of the Duke's interview with the BBC which caused his fall from grace.
