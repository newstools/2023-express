Looking at properties online has become a national obsession with many of us checking property portals daily for new listings. Browsing homes with indoor pools, steam rooms, stables, saunas, gyms and landscaped gardens can even be fun. However, one aspect of a property that is often deemed more important than any other is location. Location is key to the UK property market. Homes in desirable locations are in high demand which means prices are higher. Furthermore, properties in cities that have little to no room for expansion also tend to be valuable than those that have room for new homes. Buyers often want to live in areas that have access to amenities, schools and good transport links like airports and train stations. The location of a home can also determine its future value. A home based close to where new infrastructure will be implemented is likely to increase in value or at least retain its value if there’s a crash.
