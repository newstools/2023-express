Gary Lineker has found himself in hot water with the BBC, after events came to a head on Friday evening and the broadcaster announced their leading sports anchor would be taking a break from his Match of the Day duties. Lineker has been the figurehead of the iconic football highlights show for several years, though will now be off air after finding himself in an awkward position following an expression of opinion on the social media platform Twitter. The broadcaster's best-paid presenter will not front Match of the Day until an "agreed and clear position" is reached on how he uses social media. Lineker had compared the new migration policy to the tactics of Nazi Germany in tweets earlier this week. Reports have since emerging stating Lineker never agreed to stepping down from his position, and that the former England international will not be making a form of public apology if requested. After sharing a video from the Home Office featuring Suella Braverman, the BBC presenter wrote: "There is no huge influx. We take far fewer refugees than other major European countries. This is just an immeasurably cruel policy directed at the most vulnerable people in language that is not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s, and Iâ€™m out of order? Now, talk has become rife regarding what happens next with Lineker, and who will fill in the for the iconic name on the BBC screens in the meantime.'
