Toronto Raptors star Fred VanVleet said he wasn't bothered about the threat of being fined, before openly tearing into the standard of officiating in the NBA in a brutal foul-mouthed rant. VanVleet's Raptors were beaten 108-100 by the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday night, losing ground in the race for the Play-Offs in the Eastern Conference as a result. The Raptors, and VanVleet in particular, clearly felt they were given a hard time by the officials during the game at the Crypto.com Arena, however. VanVleet was called for a technical foul by referee Ben Taylor during the third quarter, and called out Taylor by name afterwards. He said: “Man, I don’t mind. I’ll take a fine, I don’t really care. I thought Ben Taylor was f****** terrible tonight. “I thought that on most nights, out of the three [officials] there’s one or two that just f*** the game up. It’s been like that a couple games in a row. Denver was tough, obviously, and then you come out tonight, compete pretty hard and in the third quarter I get a bull**** tech - changed the whole dynamic and flow of the game. “Most of the refs are trying hard, I like a lot of the refs. They’re pretty fair. They communicate well, and then you got the other ones who just want to be d**** and it just kind of f**** the game up. Nobody is coming to see that s***. “They’re coming to see the players. I think we’re losing a little bit of the fabric of what the NBA is and was. It’s been disappointing this season. You can look it up: most of my techs this year have been with Ben Taylor officiating so at a certain point as a player you feel it’s personal. It’s never a good place to be. It’s not why we lost tonight - we got outplayed - but it definitely makes it tougher to overcome.” The Raptors remain in ninth place in the Eastern Conference, six games back from the sixth-placed Brooklyn Nets, who currently occupy the final automatic Play-Off berth. As it stands, the Raptors are facing a fight to remain in the play-in tournament, as they are only 1.5 games ahead of the Chicago Bulls.
