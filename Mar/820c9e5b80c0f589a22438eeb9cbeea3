Idris Elba, 50, was in high spirits this evening as he made his grand entrance into the global premiere of his movie Luther: The Fallen Sun. Showing up at BFI IMAX Waterloo in the heart of London, he stunned in a suave lilac suit. Meanwhile his wife, former Miss Vancouver model Sabrina Dhowre, donned a slinky black dress as she stood proudly by his side. Idris was already renowned for his starring role in the Luther TV series, but now that the film version has been released on Netflix, he has joined the epic party to celebrate. Earlier that day, he'd stopped off at Kiss Radio Studios ahead of the event, but it was when he took to the red carpet that he truly dressed to impress.
