According to This Is Money, 20 percent of people leaving London chose Slough as their new home. Known for its proximity to Thorpe Park and Heathrow Airport, Slough is believed to be on the up with Crossrail coming to the town and its centre due for regeneration. Separately, Slough was voted one of the worst places to live in England by a poll published on ILiveHere.com. It came fourth behind, Portsmouth, Peterborough, and Luton.

A £400m regeneration project focusing on the town centre has begun. This will see 1,500 new homes plus office space, a hotel, a restaurant quarter, and a bus shelter built. While some former London residents are looking to move to Slough, others want to leave. Speaking to MyLondon, Jackie Hughes, 68, a food vendor, said: “If I owned my house I would sell it and move tomorrow.” Not everyone wants to leave. Café employee Karoina Wroblemwicz said she was a fan of the town. However, she said she knew “people that want to move out from here”.  She added: “Rent is ridiculous. It is £1000 for a studio flat plus bills. It is like we have London prices, but our wages are not like London.“For people who are working in London, in 20 minutes you take a train and you are in London. If you live here and work in London, perfect but when you live here and you work here - it’s not that great.” Others are more optimistic. Recent arrival Zee Arku said: “I think it's a really vibrant area and I think with the right investment and the attention it could really thrive and that's where things like Crossrail come in. "Where there is a good transport hub, you'll find there are people, there is accommodation, there are businesses and once that takes fruition I think Slough will completely transform and I look forward to seeing it." Whether the investment will fuel an influx from London remains to be seen.
