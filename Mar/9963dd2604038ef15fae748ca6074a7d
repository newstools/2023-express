The man accused of killing nine-year-old Olivia Pratt-Korbel has arrived in court where he is due to stand trial. Thomas Cashman, 34 denies the murder of Olivia, and further charges of attempted murder and the wounding with intent of Olivia's mother Cheryl Korbel. Olivia was shot at her home in Dovecot, Liverpool in August last year after a gunman chased a burglar into their home. CashmanÂ of Grenadier Drive, West Derby, Liverpool, also denies two counts of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life. Armed police surrounded Manchester Crown Court on Monday as Cashman arrived by police escort. The trial is expected to last around four weeks.  Following her death, Olivia's family described her as a "unique, chatty, nosey little girl who broke the mould when she was born". They said: "Although her life was short, her personality certainly wasn't and she lived it to the most she could, and would blow people away with her wit and kindness."
