A thug who brutally beat a Staffordshire bull terrier with a metal lead has been spared jail. Mark Brown, 24, was snagged when RSPCA received a 37-second clip which showed him striking cowering Rocco several times. A court heard Rocco flinched every time Brown hit him in the home in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear.  In an independent expert veterinary report, which was presented to the court, a vet stated: "His fear was likely to have been a repeated state on previous occasions when this person was with Rocco as he immediately submitted to his attacker and attempted to flee." Brown, of no fixed abode, admitted causing unnecessary suffering to the brindle and white dog. He was sentenced to an 18-month community order with 30 rehabilitation activity requirement days. He was also disqualified from keeping dogs for 10 years and will not be able to contest the ban for five years, reports Chronicle Live. South Tyneside Magistrates' Court heard the dog avoided serious injury despite the attack on November 3.    Police took Rocco into their possession and handed him into the RSPCA's care where he has remained throughout the legal proceedings. The court heard, in Brown's defence, how Rocco was vicious and had tried to turn to attack the defendant and that’s why he slapped him. The RSPCA now hopes Rocco will be rehomed to a loving new family in due course. Inspector Kirsty Keogh-Laws investigated the case for the animal welfare charity. Following the hearing, she said: "This was a vicious attack on a young defenceless animal who had been in Brown’s care. "It is completely unacceptable to treat any animal in this way and we will always look into reports of animal cruelty and, where necessary, seek justice for that animal."
