Michelle Silva uses her Instagram account to share the anti-aging tips she has learned in the beauty industry over the years. She wows followers with her very smooth, flawless skin. She told her 60K followers one skincare product she swears by, more than any other anti-aging tip or trick. Michelle said: "Do you want to know the secret anti-aging ingredient necessary to look 10 to 15 years younger than your age? "Honestly, it's not even a secret. Retinol is the anti-aging ingredient that preserves your skin." Retinol is derived from vitamin A. It sinks deep into the skin and boosts the production of elastin and collagen by neutralising free radicals. This helps to reverse and reduce the look of fine lines, wrinkles, and enlarged pores. Michelle went on: "There are decades of research on the benefits of retinol for anti-aging and I can vouch that it's all true.

"Collagen production helps to firm the skin, which combats the signs of aging and also increases cellular turnover bringing fresh and healthy skin cells to the surface. "I am not a skincare professional but I am an expert on my skin. My consistent use of retinol for the past 20 years has preserved my skin."
