Eagle-eyed fans might recognise the imposing beach from the fantasy TV series, Game of Thrones. While Reynisfjara is extremely beautiful, it’s not a sunbathing spot as the water is freezing and waves can be as high as 130 feet. A tourist wrote on Tripadvisor: “Don’t miss. From the beach to the little church, it was perfect.” Another tourist said: “Stunning beach. Breathtaking views. If the weather is bad and cloudy, the beach is often more beautiful. Don’t miss this unique beach!” Praia de Falesia took the second spot on the list. The 60km beach is one of the jewels of the Algarve. With golden sand backed by red cliffs, the beach is a popular spot with families and local residents. Spiaggia dei Conigli, on the Italian island of Lampedusa, took the third place on the list. Known as Rabbit beach, it’s renowned for its crystal clear blue waters.
