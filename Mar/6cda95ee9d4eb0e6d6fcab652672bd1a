Boxing promoter Eddie Hearn has taken aim at Jake Paul after the YouTube star suffered defeat by split decision against Tommy Fury on Sunday night. Paul now has a professional record of 6-1 with his other fights coming against fellow social media stars and MMA fighters. After the pay-per-view bout both sides seemed to accept that a rematch is on the cards. However, Hearn believes that fans won't want to see the rivals fight again. After the bout fellow YouTuber turned boxer KSI claimed that he would 'destroy' both of his fellow social media stars. Hearn believes that Paul should fight the British rapper instead of a re-match against Fury. “For me, the rematch, I know people will watch it, but we’ve seen what they are, which is not very good," said Hearn talking on the DAZN Boxing Show. “We can’t keep debating that this guy (Paul) is actually any good, he’s not.

Because the reality is any time you fight anyone with any ability, you will get beat.” Hearn promotes some of the biggest names in boxing including multi-weight world champion Canelo Alvarez who Paul has challenged to a fight. Hearn has a brutal view of the boxing ability of vocal American Paul and his rival Fury, who is the half-brother of heavyweight world champion Tyson Fury. “He (Paul) says, ‘I’m a world class fighter that’s gonna beat Canelo Alvarez,’" added Hearn. DON'T MISS:  “But then you get criticised when you give your opinion to say, ‘He’s not very good.’ Tommy Fury is also not very good at all. What you had last night was two not very good fighters who were quite evenly matched. “But give Jake his due, he got in there, he had a go." Hearn made the decision last year to sue YouTube star Paul after the Problem Child refused to apologise after alleging the promoter had bribed a judge. Hearn filed a lawsuit seeking $100million in damages for defamation.
