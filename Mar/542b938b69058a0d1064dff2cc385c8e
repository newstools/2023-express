Jonnie Irwin, 49, has been bravely embracing his life after he was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer, which has spread to his brain. The A Place in the Sun favourite was pictured enjoying a drink with his wife Jessica at the launch of the new Gaucho restaurant in Newcastle last night. Jonnie looked dapper at the party, thrown by sports stars Alan Shearer and Lee Westwood, in a navy jumper, grey hat, and vibrant scarf, while his other half looked stylish in zebra print trousers and a black top. The couple spent time with former EastEnders actress Jill Halfpenny at the star-studded restaurant opening. It comes after Jonnie recently opened up about his condition, telling BBC’s Morning Live he is trying to make as many cherished memories as possible with his wife Jessica and their three sons - Rex, three, and two-year-old twins Rafa and Cormac. He also poignantly told the programme he is planning on recording video messages for his family, so they can still hear from him after he dies.
