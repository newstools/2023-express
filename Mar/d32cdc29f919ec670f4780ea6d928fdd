Ukrainian military leaders have expressed determination to hold onto Bakhmut as Russian forces encroached on the devastated eastern city after half a year of vicious fighting. Less than a week ago, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the defenders might retreat from Bakhmut, located in the eastern Donetsk region of Ukraine, and fall back to nearby positions. But Mr Zelensky’s office said today that he chaired a meeting in which the country's top military brass “spoke in favour of continuing the defence operation and further strengthening our positions in Bakhmut”. The city has taken on symbolic importance far outweighing its questionable strategic value over the course of fighting there, with Russia’s most brutal fighters known to be stationed in the area. For Vladimir Putin, prevailing in Bakhmut would finally deliver some good news from the front. For Kyiv, the display of grit and defiance reinforces a message that Ukraine is holding on after a year of brutal attacks, justifying continued support from its Western allies.
