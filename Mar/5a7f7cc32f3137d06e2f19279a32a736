The most patient person Iâ€™ve known my entire life. "She helped everyone who needed it. I lost count of how many times she stopped eating to help others, and how many baskets she donated.   "She raised me alone, she was always a fighter. Everything my mother bought was the result of her hard work. "She had me very young at 17. She has three siblings, all of them are in a lot of pain. The advice she always gave me was to study. "Today I am a nursing technician. Her dream was that I become a doctor." The investigation remains ongoing.
