Police have charged a man with murder after a 37-year-old woman was found dead in a flat near a Scottish racecourse. Darrell Buchanan's body was recovered on February 18 at 8.10am from a flat complex in Hamilton Park North in Lanarkshire, Scotland, with Walter Buchanan, 64, charged with her murder. Buchanan appeared at Hamilton Sheriff Court to answer the charges in a private hearing. While at the hearing on Monday, February 27, Buchanan entered no plea and was remanded in custody. Authorities expect he will appear again within the next eight days, and prosecutors have committed the case for further examination. Residents of the Hamilton Park community have spoken of the concentrated police presence in the "nice area" following the grisly discovery. They told the Scottish Daily Record that officers knocked on their doors as they made their enquiries. One resident told the Daily Record they "woke up to police in the street". They said the local police department had stationed plain-clothed CID officers inside their flat block. They added: "There have been police everywhere, it's very worrying. This is a nice area." Hamilton Park North lies on the outskirts of a local racecourse and is described as a collection of "plush" local apartment buildings.
