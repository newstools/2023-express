New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick's relationship with current starting quarterback Mac Jones is quite different to that of which he had with long-term starter Tom Brady. Belichick and Brady enjoyed an incredible 20-year period together, winning six Super Bowl's and becoming the greatest head coach and quarterback duo in the history of the sport. But throughout their 20 years together, Belichick and Brady had many an argument in their time, with the head coach usually being critical of his quarterback - during team meetings as well as, at times, when speaking to the media. Brady himself has suggested that he liked to be coached hard by Belichick, and that if the head coach was not harsh on him, then the rest of the team would be held as accountable - with no-one being untouchable. However, that does not seem to be the case with current quarterback Jones, with Belichick reportedly telling other coaches to not to be too hard on him, a report in The AthleticÂ has stated.  A source told The Athletic that if Jones made a mistake or needed to be corrected, instead of yelling at him, the coaching staff generally took a more constructive approach. That happened on many occasions in 2022, a disappointing season for Jones who did not build on his impressive rookie year. The way Belichick treats Jones might well be an indication on where he sees the quarterback moving forward, with the former Alabama quarterback potentially fighting for his spot next season.  Jones did miss games last season, with back-up in rookie Bailey Zappe playing well in his place, as some fans even cheered for Zappe to come in and start over Jones. And the report also added that Zappe will get a fair chance to compete with Jones next season. Whatever the case, Jones is someway behind Brady, who he was routinely compared to in 2021.
