Dawn French, 65, twinned with Strictly Come Dancing host Claudia Winkleman, 51, in aid of Comic Relief. After the Vicar of Dibley star copied Claudia's signature look, featuring everything from the dramatically long black fringe to the frosty pink lipstick and the trademark fake tan, the pair looked eerily alike. They had been filming a sketch based on Claudia's TV show The Traitors, especially for Red Nose Day. It will be screened by the BBC on March 17, with the aim of raising funds for Comic Relief. When Dawn shared the results of her dramatic makeover with her 580,000 Instagram followers, she was branded a "goddess".
