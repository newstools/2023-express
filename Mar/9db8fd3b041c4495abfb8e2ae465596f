PlayStation Plus Premium and Extra subscribers are counting down to the official reveal of the PS Plus games for March 2023. The next batch of PS Plus Extra and Premium titles will be revealed at 4.30pm GMT on March 15. The next batch of PS Plus Extra and Premium games will be available to download and play less than a week later, on March 21. Of course, it's not all good news, because the launch of the new games coincides with the removal of others. Consider this your last chance warning, because a grand total of nine games will leave the service on March 21. This includes the wonderful Vanishing of Ethan Carter, as well as Victor Vran, Danger Zone and Dungeons 2. Other games leaving the service include Ghost of a Tale, Monster Energy Supercross 5, Override 2, and Velocibox. With the next game in the series launching later this week, Sony will also remove WWE 2K22 from PS Plus Extra. As for the new games, there's a strong chance we'll see a leak ahead of the big reveal. Available to subscribers on higher tiers, the new games will feature a selection of modern blockbusters, indie gems and one or two classics from the early PlayStation era. Last month's new games line-up was headlined by Horizon Forbidden West, as well as Resident Evil 7 and Borderlands 3. Classics include The Legend of Dragoon, Wild Arms 2 and Harvest Moon: Back to Nature. Express Online will keep this article updated with all the latest leaks and news as it becomes available.
