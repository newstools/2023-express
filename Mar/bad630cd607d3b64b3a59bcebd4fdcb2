Lionel Messi may have played his final Champions League game and Cristiano Ronaldo will likely be delighted. Ronaldo's European exploits may be over after signing a two-and-a-half-year contract with Al Nassr, but his legacy could be secure after Paris Saint-Germain's latest exit. Bayern Munich defeated PSG 2-0 on Wednesday, sealing a 3-0 aggregate victory to progress into the Champions League quarter-finals. Messi, Kylian Mbappe, and co couldn't break down Julian Nagelsmann's complete side in either leg, resulting in more European disappointment.
