State pensioners are amongst the most vulnerable groups which could benefit the most from all the rises. As the cost of living crisis continues, any boost could be vital for those households on low incomes. Pensioner benefits such as Pension Credit and Attendance Allowance are all set to rise in April 2023, alongside state pension payments. With April just a month away, many pensioners may be wondering how much more they will be getting. State pension Anyone receiving the full new state pension will get an extra £19 a week from Monday, April 10 onwards, while anyone who reached state pension age before April 2016 (and receives the full basic state pension) will get an extra £14 weekly. That takes the former to £10,600 a year or £203.85 per week for 2023/24, from £185.15 in the last financial year, and the latter to £8,100 a year or £156.20, up from £141.85. Full new state pension: £203.85 (from £185.15)Basic old State Pension: (Category A or B): £156.20 (from £141.85) READ MORE: Lloyds Bank is offering £200 free cash for savers but just days left to claim People can check their eligibility for Pension Credit using the online calculator or by calling the Pension Credit helpline on 0800 99 1234.

Some eight million pensioner households will also get a £300 cost of living payment in late 2023. The £300 payment will be made on top of Winter Fuel Payments, which in late 2022 were made to nearly every pensioner who turned 66 born before September 26, 1956. In winter 2023/2024, the Winter Fuel and Cost of Living Payments are expected to be made to those who reach the state pension age before September 25, 2023. That means most people born before September 25, 1957, will get Winter Fuel Payments plus an extra £300.
