Vanessa Hudgens, 34, was sure to turn heads as she arrived early at the 95th Academy Awards this evening. The High School Musical star looked the mirror image of Audrey Hepburn in her strapless black and white gown, hitting the floor, highlighting her hourglass figure. Not to distract from the show-stopping number, Vanessa wore her hair up in a top knot as she modelled several pieces of diamond jewellery. One which Vanessa highlighted was her engagement ring from baseball player, Cole Tucker, 26. This comes as her ex Austin Butler prepares to hit the red carpet as he finds out if he takes Best Actor for his 2022 Elvis biopic.
