Police who are searching for the missing newborn of Constance Marten and Mark Gordon have found what is thought to be a baby blanket in the woods. Pictures from the scene in Brighton, East Sussex, show clothes strewn across the ground as police inspected what looked like burnt items. Marten and Gordon are currently being held in custody after being arrested on Monday, February 27. Their baby was just days old when they vanished on January 5. The white blanket was not placed into an evidence bag, reports The Sun. Police fear the newborn "may have come to harm" as the frantic search for the infant continues. Aristocrat Marten, 35, and her lover Gordon, 48, were found in Stanmer Villas, Brighton, after a tip-off from a member of the public. Their newborn was not with them when they were found. Police revealed on Tuesday that the couple had been arrested on suspicion of "gross negligence manslaughter" after refusing to disclose the location or gender of their child. When the couple went missing on January 5, there were fears that the child would come to harm from the elements as the pair lived "off grid". Over 200 officers are scouring a 91-square mile area across East Sussex - with a focus on the Stanmer Villas and Roedale Valley Allotments area of Brighton. Police said they have searched every shed on the veg plot and will remain on site for some time.
