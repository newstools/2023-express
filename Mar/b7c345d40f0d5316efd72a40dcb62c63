Police have launched a manhunt after a 10-year-old boy was sexually assaulted at a London Underground station. They have released CCTV in connection with the incident, which took place at Leicester Square station. At around 4.30pm on Thursday, February 16, the boy was walking up a set of stairs with his family when a man sexually assaulted him before running away. The victim’s mother chased the man through the station, but didn’t catch him. The incident was then reported to the British Transport Police. Officers have now released a CCTV image of a man who they believe may have information that could help their investigation. Anyone who recognises the man or may have any information is urged to contact BTP by texting 61016 or calling 0800 40 50 40 quoting reference 474 of 16 February. Anyone who prefers to do so can also call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. Last year, TfL rolled out a “zero tolerance” campaign on sexual harassment. The campaign, which includes posters across the network and social media activity, aims to challenge sexual harassment on London transport - and “send a clear message to offenders that it is illegal and will not be tolerated on our services". Since the Zero Tolerance to Sexual Harassment campaign went live in October 2021 and was relaunched this August, 1,813 sexual offences on the TfL network have been reported to the police - compared to 1,067 offences in the same period the year before, with the majority of reports being sexual assault. TfL board papers say the reporting was “anticipated” and is a “positive sign that the campaign is working”, given that sexual harassment is significantly underreported. Sexual harassment on the bus network can be reported on the Met Police's website. For other TfL services, text British Transport Police on 61016, call 0800 40 50 40 or report online at their website.
