A man and a woman are set to stand trial over the death of a two-year-old girl. Lola James died after suffering a "catastrophic" head injury at her home in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, Wales in July 2020. Kyle Bevan, 30, is accused of murdering the toddler while her mother, Sinead James, 29 is charged with causing or allowing her death. The pair will stand trial on Tuesday at Swansea Crown Court and is expected to last a month. The court heard previously that Lola suffered a head injury at her home and police were called to the property following the incident. Lola died four days later at Noah's Ark Children's Hospital in Cardiff on July 17. Bevan and James were initially arrested on suspicion of assault and neglect but were later charged with the crimes they are standing trial for. Bevan, of Queen's Road, Aberystwyth was remanded in custody ahead of the trial while James, of Neyland, Pembrokeshire was released on conditional bail. Following Lola's death, her father Dan Thomas paid tribute to his daughter saying she had a "beautiful smile" that would always be missed, leaving a "hole in the hearts" of everyone that knew her. He said: "From the very first time I met my beautiful daughter, Lola Patricia James, my heart was filled with such joy, a happiness I’d never felt before, an unconditional love and need to always protect her for the rest of her life. "All the things she never had the chance to learn, see or say, and all the things I will never have a chance to teach her – to write her name, ride a bike or drive a car. "Lola, you have left a hole in the hearts of everyone you met. Your sparkly eyes and beautiful smile will be missed always."
