John Travolta, 69, couldn't hold back his emotions while introducing Lenny Kravitz's In Memoriam performance at the Academy Awards. The Pulp Fiction star referenced his late Grease co-star and on-screen love interest Olivia Newton-John, who tragically died last year after a long battle with cancer. John poignantly mentioned Olivia's famous ballad in Grease, Hopelessly Devoted To You. The Hollywood star said in his speech: "Since tonight is a celebration of the work and accomplishments of our community this past year, it is only fitting that we celebrate those we lost, who dedicated their lives to their craft both in front of and behind the camera." "Through their immeasurable contributions each of them left an individual mark that shared and informed us." John's eyes then filled with tears as he struggled to continue. READ MORE...
