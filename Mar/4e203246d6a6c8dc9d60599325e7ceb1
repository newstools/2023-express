Nintendo Switch fans are counting down to the release of the next wave of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe DLC. Wave 4 of the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course Pass has a March 9 release date on Nintendo Switch. While there's no exact launch time, the Nintendo eShop is typically updated at around 3pm GMT UK time, so expect the courses to go live around then. Like previous expansions, Wave 4 contains two cups and eight courses, including multiple tracks from Mario Kart Tour. As you can see from the latest Mario Kart 8 Deluxe gameplay trailer below, the new courses include Singapore Speedway, Bangkok Rush, and Amsterdam Drift from the mobile game. That's on top of classic courses like DK Summit from the Nintendo Wii and Riverside Park from the Game Boy Advance. The Nintendo DS version of Mario Circuit will also be included in the bundle, alongside the Gamecube's WaLuigi Stadium. Arguably most exciting of all, however, is the addition of the brand new Yoshi's Island course for Nintendo Switch. The colourful new track sees players race on clouds, in the mountains and even below the water. In addition to the new courses, Nintendo has announced plans to bring classic Mario Kart characters to the game. This includes Birdo from Super Mario Bros. 2 and Mario Kart: Double Dash, who joins Mario Kart 8 Deluxe as part of Wave 4. Wave 4 will be followed by two additional expansion packs in 2023, complete with a further 16 courses. Nintendo Switch owners can purchase the entire Booster Course DLC from the Nintendo eShop for Â£22.99. Alternatively, Expansion Pass + subscribers can access each wave at no extra cost as part of their membership. The Expansion Pass also grants access to a host of classic N64 and Sega Mega Drive games, as well as Animal Crossing DLC and Splatoon content.
