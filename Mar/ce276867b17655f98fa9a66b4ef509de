Rea Williams, said: "Darcy Ross I’m going to miss you little gypsy girl. You were one of a kind, I’m going to miss trying to ‘life coach’ you as you would’ve said. You were a real ray of sunshine especially on my bad days." Another said "Rest in Paradise Rafel". Rafel's dad Leon, 42, played as a winger for QPR and Cardiff City before moving around a host of other clubs and retiring in 2015. Eve appeared in a Sky reality TV show after her sister was killed by a drug-driver. The group of friends were last seen around 2am on Saturday morning, with the search lasting 48 hours.
