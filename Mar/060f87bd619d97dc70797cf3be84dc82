A school scrambled to protect children after a threatening phone call today. Parents of children at Orchard Mead Academy near Hamilton, Leicester were informed at around 9.35am of the phone call, which led to staff carrying out invacuation procedures. Invacuation, also called invac, means the pupils remain inside, but have been moved to a safe area. Mark Oldman, executive principal, reassured parents that all students were safe and in the building. The school admitted the circumstances were "unsettling". The message, sent to Leicestershire Live by a parent, read: "Some of you may have heard that the school received a threatening phone call this morning which has led to us following our invac procedure. "I want to assure you that all pupils are safe and in school. We will update you across the school day. "Please don’t feel the need to come to the school or get in contact unless we ask you to."  No further details about the phone call were disclosed by staff at the school. But the school since confirmed it wil close for the remainder of the day. A further message, which is on the school's website, reads: "Please be assured that our invacuation procedure has now been completed. We followed the advice of the police and at all points have been directed by them in our approach. "We accept that this will have been unsettling for students and parents, though we wish to reiterate that students have been impeccable in their behaviour and approach. "As a result, we are closing the school for the remainder of the day. Students will be allowed to leave site at the following times: Yr11 11.35, Yr10 11.40, Yr9 11.45, Yr8 11.50, Yr7 11.55pm. They may collect lunch if they wish to. Should you wish your child to stay on site, arrangements can be made for this by telephoning reception. "School will resume as normal tomorrow 8th March."
