 The actress, 50, took to Instagram on Thursday with well-wishes writing: “Happy birthday to the sweetest father and friend. We love you,” with some heart emojis. Fans fawned over the loving message and the pair’s sweet friendship after their break up, with author Jen Pastiloff sharing: “You inspire me as I go through my divorce.” Leeron_14 added: “Divorced couple goals for sure.” Although the pair "consciously uncoupled" in 2014, they have remained friends and co-parents to their children Apple, 18, and Moses, 16. Chris celebrated his 46th birthday just a day after Gwyneth’s current husband, writer and producer Brad Falchuk, turned 52. The Goop founder has notoriously good friendships with her famous exes, including Brad Pitt who she was engaged to in the late 1990s.
