A blind student says a taxi driver refused to stop to pick up a guide dog, leaving them both stranded by the side of the road. Kelsey Trevett, 21, said it left a ­feeling of being “vulnerable” and “powerless” and was one of several ­incidents in a year. The politics and philosophy student at Oxford University booked the cab from a friend’s house back home one Saturday night. But when the taxi arrived, the driver refused to stop. Speaking to the Express, Kelsey – who prefers to use a gender neutral term – said: “I hate to say that I almost expect to be refused access when I order a taxi. It happens regularly enough that it affects me. It’s something that stays with you after ­it happens.” Kelsey said: “It was cold, it was dark, I was vulnerable, yet I was left on the kerb.” Kelsey called for another although that one let the dog travel, albeit reluctantly. Kelsey, who has been blind since the age of six, says reluctant cabbies usually say they are “scared of” or “allergic to” dogs. Guide dog owners should report similar incidents using the Guide Dogs charity’s Open Doors app, said Kelsey. It comes as three-quarters of assistance dog owners surveyed by Guide Dogs say they are regularly refused access to restaurants, shops, or public transport. Under the Equality Act, guide dog owners have the right to enter the majority of services, premises and vehicles with their dog. A Guide Dogs spokesman said: “The law is clear, and yet guide dog owners such as Kelsey continue to experience access refusals, which…can put people at risk.” Kelsey added: “We need to ensure all workers – whether in a restaurant, taxi, theatre, pub, wherever – are trained in dealing with service dog users and are aware of the Act.”
