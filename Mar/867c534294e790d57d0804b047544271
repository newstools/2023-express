That is good for workers, but Fed officials worry rising wages might fuel inflation. That might lead to more rate hikes to dampen business activity and hiring. Rubeela Farooqi of High Frequency Economics said in a report Fed officials were â€œclearly messaging that rates will move higher". The Fed's inflation-fighting policies risk slowing the economy too much and pushing it into a recession, while also going too far in softening a strong labor market and putting many people out of work.  A US government report on Thursday showed that the number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits last week jumped by the most in five months, but layoffs remain historically low. Yields on the two-year Treasury, which tends to track expectations for future Fed action, eased to 4.87 percent from about 5.05 percent just before the unemployment report's release. It had been hovering at its highest level since 2007. The unemployment data follows a report on Wednesday showing that the number of job openings advertised across the country last month was higher than economists expected. A big concern within the labour market reports for the Fed and Wall Street is the pace of wage growth. Strong wage gains are good for workers struggling to keep up with high inflation, but they could also keep pushing inflation higher, making it harder for the central bank to fight high prices.
