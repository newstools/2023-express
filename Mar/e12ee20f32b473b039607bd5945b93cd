Russia launched six hypersonic Kinzhal cruise missiles as part of a huge attack across Ukraine, a spokesman for the country's air force has said. Yurii Ihnat said he was unable to recall such an onslaught. Officials report at least six deaths in the largest night-time attack in three weeks.  Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba was scathing about the attack, tweeting: "No military objective, just Russian barbarism." Authorities in Kyiv said the capital was hit by missiles and exploding drones. Many were intercepted, but the city's energy infrastructure was hit. Smoke could be seen rising from a facility in Kyivâ€™s Holosiivskyi district and police had cordoned off all roads leading to it. The alarm in Kyiv was lifted just before 6am GMT with the air raid sirens falling silent after around seven hours. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES..
