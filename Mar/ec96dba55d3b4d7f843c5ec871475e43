The Belarusian rebel group that blew up a Kremlin spy plane with drones has vowed to launch more attacks on Moscow’s forces. Aliaksandr Azarau, leader of the BYPOL militia – a force he claims is 200,000 strong – told the Daily Express he “will never stop”, in a fresh warning to Putin and his Belarus puppet president Alexander Lukashenko. BYPOL, run by former staff of the Belarusian security services, gained notoriety this week after it claimed to have destroyed the huge £274million Kremlin plane near capital Minsk. The rebel leader said the world should expect to see more attacks by his partisans soon. Mr Azarau warned: “We are going to fight against the Russian regime of Lukashenko for the victory of democracy and independence of our country.” BYPOL’s leaders operate from exile in Poland. They command supporters using encrypted social media. The group says it aims to prevent Putin from taking over Belarus – a process Mr Azarau claims started when Lukashenko “rigged” the 2020 presidential election. BYPOL had been supporting Ukraine by sabotaging railway tracks to hinder Russian supply lines, but stopped when more troops were put on guard. Mr Azarau said several of his men were arrested by Belarusian authorities. He said some had been shot in the legs, with their ordeal televised.
