Aston Martin F1 driver Lance Stroll has revealed that he couldn't move hands or walk after his bicycle crash in Spain, and has admitted he feared the worst ahead of the new season. The Canadian-Belgian driver fell off of his bike in Spain while training and had to have surgery. Stroll missed pre-season in Bahrain after suffering his injuries, in what was initially described as a 'minor' bicycle crash, with Aston Martin then releasing a statement. Speaking for the first time on what happened, Stroll told Sky F1: "It has been pretty insane. It’s exactly two weeks today since my crash, my bike crash. 12 days since surgery, came out of the hospital a week ago. "I couldn’t move my hands, I couldn’t walk, I broke my toe. Bahrain looked like it was very far away at the time and I didn’t think it was… the light at the end of the tunnel was very far at the time.  "Really just grateful to be here and back in the car, thanks to everyone, my physio, the doctor in Spain that did the procedure. Everyone just helped me massively to be here right now." Although back racing, the 24-year-old has admitted that his toe is still in pain at times, especially so when competing. He added: "Today (Saturday) is actually the first day I’m feeling that my toe is good enough to walk on it. It doesn’t hurt in the car, unless I hit a few bumps.   "I’m feeling better every day, just doing a lot of physio, ice on my wrists. Every day is that 10 per cent improvement kind of thing. Tomorrow should be good, we have a great car in the long runs so I’m looking forward to it." Stroll will race in the season opener on Sunday, and will be on the fourth row of the grid along with Lewis Hamilton.
