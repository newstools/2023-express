Met Office weather forecasters have pinpointed the day they expect more "disruptive snow" to cascade across the UK. Warnings released by the agency on Monday have outlined possible widespread issues caused by heavy accumulations up to Friday, March 10. But there remains a chance of additional chaos beyond this period, the forecasters warned. In its latest long-range forecast, the Met Office said "cold conditions" would persist into the weekend, at least.From Saturday, March 11, they will remain dominant in the north, with the possibility of "wintry showers" on the horizon. The bitter chill comes with a "small chance" of causing "more disruptive snowfall", forecasters added. The snow is most likely "along the northern edge of the rain band", where temperatures remain the coldest.  Maps from WXCharts show continued snow flurries over northern England and Scotland over the weekend. The charts show a band of rain washing over the UK and Ireland from the west, arriving on the Irish coast by Saturday morning.  After slowly moving over the island of Ireland, the showers will reach the UK mainland on Sunday, March 12. A snowy front will develop at the system's head as it moves inland and towards the north. Snow will settle primarily north of Manchester, coating the northeast before moving into Scotland. WXCharts maps show possible accumulations of up to 14cm over high ground in England and 19cm over Scotland.
