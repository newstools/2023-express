Daisy Edgar-Jones, 24, was sure to turn heads last night as she attended Vanity Fair's Oscars after-party in a very racy number. The Normal People star wowed in the revealing look, featuring a nude bodysuit and a black see-through net overlay. Flaunting her enviable figure, the shimmering gown featured a chunky rhinestone embellished collar, adorned with jewels. She teamed the dress with a pair of black sandals as she posed up a storm, showing off all angles of the risque ensemble. The screen star accessorised with dainty dangly earrings and did not add any other jewellery.
