A pensioner has been dashed to hospital following a horror crash in which a tanker flipped and a minibus hit its debris. The accident happened yesterday on the A71 westbound near Dreghorn, Ayrshire, and the dual-carriageway remains closed as a result. The tanker overturned and was hit by a minibus travelling towards Irvine and Ayr. Traffic monitoring system Inrix says the road will be shut for several days while emergency repairs are carried out. Police confirmed a 71-year-old woman was taken to hospital, Daily Record says. A Police Scotland spokesperson added: "Around 3.35pm on Thursday, March 2, a tanker overturned on the A71 at the Moorfield Roundabout near Kilmarnock. "A minibus travelling behind the tanker struck debris on the road and a 71-year-old female passenger was taken by ambulance to hospital as a precaution."The eastbound carriageway was reopened around 7pm. The westbound carriageway remains closed and enquiries are ongoing." The closure is having a huge impact on the surrounding road network with huge queues extending back to the Bellfield Interchange. Traffic is also heavy through the diversion route via Crosshouse, Springside and Dreghorn in Ayrshire. "A71 Westbound closed due to emergency repairs between B7064 (Moorfield roundabout, Kilmarnock ) and B730 (Corsehill Mount roundabout, Dreghorn ). The road has been closed since a tanker overturned on Thursday afternoon," Inrix said. The A77 is slow as a result of the closure too, with traffic building in and around Coodham.
