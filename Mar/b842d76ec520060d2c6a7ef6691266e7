Carl Froch’s latest attempt to entice Jake Paul into a lucrative fight has boxing fans cringing over the inclusion of his often-cited belief that the earth is flat. The 45-year-old took to his new Youtube channel, Froch on Fighting, to taunt his would-be opponent after saying he was still open to fighting The Problem Child - and older brother Logan, in the aftermath of Paul’s defeat to Tommy Fury last weekend. In his latest barb, Froch warned Paul to watch his mouth lest he face the consequences of an altercation with Froch’s infamous right hand which, in his worldview, would send the Youtube star into orbit or wherever is ‘beyond that firmament dome’. “Stop talking nonsense about being a professional fighter or fighting pros,” warned the three-time world champion. “I’m nearly ten years retired, you ran your mouth but it didn’t get you very far did it? You talked about me fighting Anderson Silva and you put all these parameters in place. “Listen, you know now that if this hand hits ya, you will definitely be in orbit. Wherever orbit is, we don’t know what’s beyond that firmament dome do we?” Froch is a fervent believer in the conspiracy theory which asserts that the planet is flat, and like many flat-earthers, discredits the ocean of scientific and photographic evidence to the contrary. "There's no proof of the Earth's curvature and this fake space agency Nasa use CGI images and every one is different,” he said on the Pound for Podcast podcast in 2022. "I'm looking at them thinking, 'Hang on a minute, they're like cartoons'. "When someone like Richard Branson goes up there and starts doing chartered flights... and you can look back on Earth and see the Earth's curvature, I'll believe the Earth is a globe." Despite flirting with a fight against Froch, Paul is expected to trigger the rematch clause in his contract with Paul and try to avenge his only professional loss immediately.
