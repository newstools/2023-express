Their pre-season test showed that the Dutchman and his team will still take some beating. Things haven't been so positive for Mercedes, with Hamilton and George Russell admitting that there is still work to be done on the car to have a realistic change of closing the gap on their rivals. Russell out-pointed Hamilton last season, with the veteran looking to restore his status as top dog this year. As the F1 stories coming thick and fast, follow Express Sport's live updates below...
