Diana Nneka Atuona’s play is set in an extravagantly cosmopolitan boarding house run by Gwyneth (Sarah Parish) whose two daughters are the result of her interracial marriage.  When Nate, a black US soldier (Samuel Adewunmi), hides out in the garden to escape military police, the family’s loyalties are put to the test. An old-fashioned play, its conspicuous naturalism is at odds with the issue-driven melodrama. Robust performances keep the energy levels high but, theatrically, it’s lamb dressed as mutton.
