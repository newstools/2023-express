All flights to and from Bristol Airport were suspended today due to heavy snow. Planes were grounded and departure times were removed off the boards at the hub in North Somerset. The airport said: "All flights on hold due to snow affecting flights to and from Bristol Airport. Passengers should check the status of their flight before travelling. "Departure boards show that no flights are currently leaving and Bristol Airport have confirmed this is because of the snow. The conditions will be reviewed across the morning." Snow has fallen across most of southern England and Wales this morning. Photographs taken outside the airport show a fair dusting of snow settling in the early hours. The decision to stop all services was made at 8am, reports Cornwall Live.  The airport, a focus hub for easyJet, Jet2.com, Ryanair and TUI Airways, reassessed the situation but snow continued to fall throughout the day. In a tweet earlier this morning, the airport said: "Please be advised that due to adverse weather conditions at Bristol Airport, flight operations have been suspended until 0800. Passengers are advised to contact their airline for specific flight information prior to travelling to the airport and please take extra care." The airport is particularly susceptible to adverse weather conditions because it is higher than 600ft above sea level, just outside the Mendip Hills. It comes as a severe weather alert has been issued for south and southeast England while broken down lorries have shut a stretch of the A3. Road users are being warned of routes becoming blocked by deep snow, raising the risk of motorists getting stranded. The Met Office has issued three yellow weather warnings, covering parts of southern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
