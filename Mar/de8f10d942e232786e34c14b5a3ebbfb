One half of Wrexham’s A-list ownership team, Rob McElhenney hailed the display of stopper Rob Lainton in the Red Dragons’ 2-1 victory over Chesterfield on Tuesday night. The Welsh club reached the National League summit on Tuesday night, thanks to first half goals from Elliot Lee and Sam Dalby, and now enjoy a one point cushion over Notts County with a game in hand. Despite Chesterfield’s Ryan Colclough blotting Lainton’s clean sheet in stoppage time, Wrexham owner McElhenney could scarcely believe the heroics on show from his keeper. “How did he stop this?” A perplexed McElhenney queried in a Tweet showing the Wrexham stopper’s Banks-esque save from a Colclough’s close range header on the hour. Before replying to another user on the platform: “An even better view. Is there a cape under that neon shirt?” The 45-year-old wasn’t done with his afternoon of National League highlights also proudly posting the celebratory message ‘Happy St. David’s Day.’ In Welsh of course.

In his absence the club have enjoyed one of the league’s best defensive records, narrowly bettered by only Southend United and Boreham. And are in the midst of a titanic battle with The Magpies to secure the National League’s solitary automatic promotion spot. Wrexham manager Phil Parkison has turned to the 33-year-old in the last three league games - all wins against Scunthorpe United, Dorking and Chesterfield - with that number set to rise as he regains match fitness and continues to impress the big boss upstairs.
