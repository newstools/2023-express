Prince Harry's string of accusations against Queen Camilla was perceived by King Charles as the "ultimate act of disrespect", it has been claimed. After the Duke of Sussex alleged in his book Spare and accompanying interviews that the now Queen Consort carried out a ruthless campaign with the press to improve her public image and that he and Prince William had pleaded with their father not to marry her, King Charles was reportedly affronted. A source told the Mirror: "It was the last straw. Harry was well aware how Camilla would be a red line for his father and he crossed with flagrant disregard anyway. The King felt without a doubt it crossed a line â€“ it was the ultimate act of disrespect." The response to the attacks against the King's "darling wife" - as His Majesty has at times called Camilla in statements - came in the wake of the worldwide publication of Spare and reportedly saw Charles informing his second son and daughter-in-law they are to vacate Frogmore Cottage within weeks. The pair are understood to have been given until early summer to ship out their possession from their Windsor home, which means they could still reside there in May if they decided to attend the Coronation.
