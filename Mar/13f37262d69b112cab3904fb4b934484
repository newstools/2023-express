Flights at Heathrow, Gatwick and City have been disrupted as the UK grapples with snowy conditions. SkyScanWorld has shared live tracker information showing passenger aircraft circling around major airports.  The situation looks likely to worsen as the Met Office warns that Britain can expect more snow. Gatwick Airport's arrivals board is showing that almost all flights are now delayed or cancelled. So far, four flights have been cancelled at Gatwick. Meanwhile, at Heathrow, at least 25 arrival flights have been cancelled. It has not been confirmed whether the cancellations are due to the adverse weather conditions. Bristol Airport has also suspended all flights. Passengers have been warned that there will be severe delays because a yellow weather warning is in place across the South West. Bristol Airport says its team are working hard to clear snow, but there will be no flights until at least 11am. In a statement, it said: "Passengers are advised to contact their airline for specific flight information prior to travelling to the airport and please take extra care." Other transport in the UK is also expected to be disrupted. On Wednesday, National Rail warned passengers that train journeys across the UK will be impacted in the coming days. Their statement said: “Until the morning of Thursday, 9 March, snow showers are expected at times, although not all areas of the network will be equally affected. “Ice will cause an additional hazard, especially overnight. “Staff are working hard to minimise any disruption, but there could be some changes to trains.
