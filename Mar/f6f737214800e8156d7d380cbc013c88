Carol Kirkwood, 60, revealed her engagement to boyfriend Steve Randall live on BBC Breakfast in May 2022 after dating for around one year. The weather presenter has remained relatively tight-lipped about their romance, but it has now been reported that he is a 47-year-old police officer from Hampshire.  The pair look besotted with each other as they beamed in the snowy mountains during a trip to Norway. She wrote in the caption: "What a difference a week makes! This time last week Steve and I were in the snow in beautiful Norway."
