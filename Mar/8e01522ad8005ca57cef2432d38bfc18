A Himalayan Doc Martin takes us to a remote village where a grumpy teacher has relocated from the capital. After life in Thimphu, wannabe musician Ugyen (Sherab Dorji) needs to acclimatise to the tranquil mountain village of LunanaÂ where local yak farmers live in harmony with their hairy livestock. But, once his iPod battery runs out, Ugyen opens his ears and his heart, feeling the pressures of his worldly ambitions fall away. While the simple plot is predictable, the scenery is gorgeous, the setting is authentic and the non-professional actors (director Pawo Choyning Dorji shot the film on location, using villagers in supporting roles) are unaffected and utterly charming.
