An 11-year-old boy who died in a tragic house fire has been named. The boy has been named locally as Daniel, but his surname is not yet known, MyLondon reports. He is believed to have been a student at Riverside High School, reports suggest. The fire broke out in the early hours of Tuesday morning in Barking, London before two adults and two children were taken to hospital. London Fire Brigade (LFB) attended the scene at the three-bedroom flat, spending around two hours battling the flames. Six fire engines and around 40 firefighters battled the blaze with LFB saying the flat was "destroyed" and nine other properties were affected. The cause of the fire is under investigation by the LFB and the Metropolitan Police. In a statement, the force said: "Enquiries continue, but at this early stage, the fire does not appear to be suspicious." A GoFundMe page has been set up to help the family who have lost their home in the fire. So far the page has raised over £2,000 to help.
