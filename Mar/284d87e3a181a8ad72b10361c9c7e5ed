Since e-cigarettes were first introduced it was hoped they could be used as a healthy alternative to smoking. Many saw them as a tool to cut back on traditional cigarettes and a way to aid quitting altogether. But in recent years various health bodies and experts have warned of their potential dangers. Mike Jones, medical and health author at Smart Fitness Edge, spoke to Express.co.uk about some of the damage vaping can cause.

However, cigarettes can be dangerous and even deadly over time. “Vaping has become increasingly popular due to its perceived safety compared to cigarettes. However, there are still hidden dangers that people may not be aware of. “Educating yourself about the possible health risks associated with vaping is important so you can make an informed choice if you decide to vape." He shared seven health risks that can come with vaping.   “The chemical diacetyl in some vape juices has been linked to a rare lung disease called popcorn lung disease (bronchiolitis obliterans),” he said. “Symptoms include shortness of breath, wheezing and chest tightness that worsen over time if left unchecked.” Mr Jones said: “Research suggests that regular vaping can harm the cardiovascular system by causing heart attacks, strokes or hypertension due to nicotine's impact on blood pressure levels and vessel constriction after smoking or vaping sessions.” He commented: “Long-term exposure to some toxic chemicals found in vape juice may increase the risk of cancer, including mouth cancer, tongue cancer or throat cancer, depending on where they reside when you vape these substances into your body.”  “Vaping involves inhaling vaporised chemicals, which can cause inflammation and damage the lungs,” he said. “Specifically, vaping has been linked to an increase in bronchitis, asthma, and other respiratory illnesses.” Mr Jones said: “Many vape juices contain nicotine, a highly addictive drug known for its adverse health effects. “Regular use of vaping could lead to addiction and long-term health problems associated with nicotine use.”  “Many vape juices contain chemicals such as diacetyl, formaldehyde, and heavy metals that are potentially dangerous when inhaled regularly over a long period of time,” he explained. “These toxins can lead to shortness of breath, skin irritation, and other health issues.” He added: “Some vapers experience throat irritation due to the high temperatures used for vaping as well as the presence of certain ingredients in the e-liquid. “This can result in coughing fits, sore throats, and hoarseness among vapers.”
