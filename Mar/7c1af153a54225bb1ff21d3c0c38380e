Tributes have been paid to three youngsters who died in a car crash in south Wales. Sophie Russon, 20, Eve Smith, 21, and Darcy Ross, 21, were last seen in Cardiff in the early hours of Saturday having travelled there from Porthcawl. They made the trip in a Volkswagen Tiguan with Rafel Jeanne, 24, and Shane Loughlin, 32, both from the Welsh capital.  A police spokesperson said the VW Tiguan had been recovered just after midnight in the St Mellons area of Cardiff.
