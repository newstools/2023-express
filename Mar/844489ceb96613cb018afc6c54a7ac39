Pub chain Marston's Brewery announced that it will be selling 61 of its pubs across the UK. The company explained that the decision was taken after the soaring costs have greatly affected the sector and added it will focus on "maximising returns" of its core venues, The Caterer reported. Marston's Brewery pubs in the Midlands, Yorkshire, Sussex and Wales will be affected by the closures. However, the restaurant will remain open until a buyer is found, and there is a chance that the new owner may choose to keep it as a pub. The chain has experienced difficulties due to the rising costs this past year and the company decided to increase the price of a pint by 45p last year. The news comes after Wetherspoon recently announced a number of closures and also increased food and drinks prices.
