Constance Marten and Mark Gordon have been remanded into custody charged with manslaughter after a court heard the remains of a baby were found in a plastic bag under some nappies in an allotment shed. The couple appeared at Crawley Magistrates' Court on Friday accused of three charges - also including concealing the birth of a child and perverting the course of justice. Marten, 35, and Gordon, 48, who according to Sky News blew kisses towards one another in the dock, spoke only to confirm their names, dates of birth and that they were of no fixed abode during a short hearing in front of a packed courtroom. Gordon wore a grey jumper over his head throughout the hearing. The aristocrat and her partner were charged with the offences on Thursday after the remains of the infant - a girl named Victoria, according to charges read out in court - were found on Wednesday afternoon following a major two-day search operation. The infant is yet to be formally identified and a post-mortem examination is due to take place on today. Vigils were held in Brighton last night in memory of the unnamed baby. Pictures showed Gordon, with his head bowed and a jumper over his head, arriving at court this afternoon. The pair will appear at the Old Bailey on March 31. Officers found the body of a baby on Wednesday in the Hollingbury area of Brighton, East Sussex, following a two-day search operation using sniffer dogs, thermal cameras, helicopters and drones. The pair were arrested on Stanmer Villas in Brighton on Monday after police spent 53 days searching for them.
