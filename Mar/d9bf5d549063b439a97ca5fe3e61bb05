A ten-year labour of love to taste a scone at every National Trust site has finally been completed by blogger Sarah Merker. The 49-year-old marketing director finished her quest on Wednesday at the Giant’s Causeway, Northern Ireland, after eating 244 cakes. She said: “I thought it would take me maybe five years or something, I didn’t expect to do it quickly, but I didn’t think it would take 10 years. “It’s all been very emotional, it’s more than a hobby.” Sarah logged her journey on a blog called nationaltrustscones.com, recording star ratings at all Trust locations in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland that serve scones. She was inspired to start sampling them in 2013 after buying an £84 annual membership to Europe’s largest conservation charity. She soon set up a Twitter account to share her findings, which has amassed a following of over 7,000. Her dedication to the project never wavered, though the frequency of scone-sampling did fluctuate from when it was harder to visit locations during the pandemic to a particularly busy August in 2019 where she managed 26. And the secret to a perfect scone? It has to be made that day. “It’s simple, she says, “it just has to be fresh.” Her favourite from a decade of tasting is a Christmas pudding scone with brandy butter at Treasurer’s House, Yorkshire. But she adds: “There’s nearly 100 scones that have been given the five stars.” As Sarah, from Isleworth, west London, finished her last scone, she also savoured a cherished memory of her husband, Peter, right. He had accompanied her on Trust visits until he died of cancer in 2018. “He’d been there for so much of it, it was really important to finish it for him as well. “That’s one reason I kept the Causeway till last, because we came here before we joined the Trust.”
