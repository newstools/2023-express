Joe Biden's "unserious" Budget could "kill" America's economy "beyond any repair", leading Republican Party figures have warned. The 46th POTUS unveiled his third Budget on Thursday during a visit to Philadelphia in Pennsylvania. President Biden's fiscal measures include reducing the deficit by $3trillion over the next decade, capping the cost of insulin to $35 a month and restoring child tax credits. The Commander-in-Chief also revealed Americans earning less than $400,000 per year would not face any tax increases but high earners and corporations will "pay their fair share". Republicans responded with disbelief to Biden's Budget. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said: "President Biden just delivered his budget to Congress, and it is completely unserious. JUST IN: 'Shut your mouth!' Republican Senator loses it with Teamsters chief in fiery clash "He proposes trillions in new taxes that you and your family will pay directly or through higher costs. "Mr President: Washington has a spending problem, NOT a revenue problem." Republican hopeful for 2024, Nikki Haley, branded Biden's plan a "disaster for America". She added: "Joe Biden doubles down on socialism in his budget proposal."

However, Biden's Budget could see the 46th POTUS lock horns with his Republican rivals on Capitol Hill. Federal spending will increase in the twelve months starting in October to $6.8trillion from the $6.2trillion spent in the 2022 fiscal year.
