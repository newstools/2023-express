Back in 1985, Live Aid raised an estimated £150 million for famine relief thanks to Bob Geldof’s multi-venue benefit concerts with Freddie Mercury and Queen stealing the show at home in Wembley Stadium. Now a charity gig the scale of this is set to be put on this summer in aid of victims of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and in support of President Volodymyr Zelensky. According to sources, this Ukraine Live Aid will be “huge” with A-list stars on a global scale. Invitations to stars are going out to the likes of The Rolling Stones, U2, The Killers and Pink. Plus the likes of Sir Paul McCartney, Adele, Florence And The Machine and Noel Gallagher are expected to be approached. Insiders say a date has been booked for Wembley Stadium and they’re optimistic huge stars will sign on, with some already being on board. The Sun’s insiders said: “For bands like U2 and Bono, who are pretty outspoken about their views on war and conflict, it feels like a great opportunity to keep hammering home the severity of the situation out in Ukraine. "An event of this size can put real political pressure on the Russians, too. The only slight downside is that the date clashes with Glastonbury so that rules out some big names but the final line-up is certain to be pretty special.” Glastonbury Festival 2023 takes place June 21-25, so presumably, the Ukraine Live Aid gig will take place around that weekend on the Friday 23rd or Saturday 24th.

Of course, if the Glastonbury stars aren’t performing on the same night as the Wembley gig, they could perhaps do a set there too. Famously last year The Rolling Stones performed at BST Hyde Park on the same night as Sir Paul McCartney’s Glastonbury set. Meanwhile, all three Glastonbury headliners this year are also on UK tours.
