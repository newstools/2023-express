Gary was involved in a car accident in 1976 after his Ford Torino crashed into a tree, which inspired the band’s song That Smell. In 1977, the band made major headlines when lead vocalist Ronnie, guitarist Steve Gaines, his sister Cassie Gaine and the group’s road manager Dean Kilpatrick were all killed in a plane crash. The crash also saw Gary break both of his arms and his leg, while his stomach and liver were punctured in the disaster.      Following the devastating tragedy, the band did not play for a decade, only reforming in 1987 for a reunion tour with Ronnie's brother Johnny Van Zant as lead vocalist. In January 2018, the band announced their farewell tour and continued performing into 2019. The band is a staple of the American classic rock genre and has sold more than 28 million records in the United States.
