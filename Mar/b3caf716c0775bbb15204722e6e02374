Tory MP Mark Francois has just been named as the new chairman of a Parliamentary inquiry into defence procurement over concerns that Britain's armed forces are not in a state of readiness with many upgrades behind schedule. The veteran Essex MP has also just tabled a Bill to "can the cones" to deal with unnecessary nuisance roadworks. Mr Francois is asking for questions from Express.co.uk readers on his roadworks Bill and the state of Britain's armed forces. It comes ahead of the Budget next week where Conservative MPs and Defence Secretary Ben Wallace are pushing for a £10 billion increase in military spending following shortfalls identified as a result of the war in Ukraine. Previously, Mr Francois has identified Britain's heavy armoured vehicles as "clapped out" during Defence Select Committee hearings in Parliament and questioned whether "they would get out of the tank park" if NATO allies in the Baltics were invaded by Russia. The Defence Select Committee has now set up a sub-committee investigation into procurement of new equipment chaired by Mr Francois. Other issues include the Type 45 Destroyers, costing £1 billion each, being unable to sail in warm waters in the Pacific. Added to that this weekend the Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is set to meet US President Joe Biden in San Diego to discuss the new Aukus deal with the UK, USA and Australia on nuclear submarines to maintain an ongoing deterrent. Mr Francois can also talk about the UK's help for Ukraine and how it impacts British military equipment. Earlier this week he and fellow MPs pressed defence minister James Heappey on why Typhoon fastjets cannot be sent to help President Zelensky's forces.
