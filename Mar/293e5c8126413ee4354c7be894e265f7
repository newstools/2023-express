With many looking to keep travel costs to a budget, the Easyjet sale has come at the perfect time, with flights to several destinations costing from £19.99. Although it hasn't launched as an official sale, this morning easyJet launched new cheap flights to multiple destinations. To get the best prices, frequent flyers will want to stay informed on when the best easyJet deals are released, and take advantage before seats sell out. Eagle-eyed travellers will have noticed a tip-off from MoneySavingExpert's Martin Lewis in which he gave a clue about when cheap flights would be released. He told his followers on Twitter that "uber cheap" easyJet flights were likely to be launched on Thursday, March 9, and it seems that these flights are now available to buy. Buy: easyJet flights When easyJet usually makes sale announcements, for example, the previous 'Big Orange Sale', the advertising and publicity around them is huge, so being able to get ahead of the masses to book a flight can be difficult. This time however, as the sale seems to involve reductions via the seat release schedule rather than an official event, it could be easier to get hold of popular flight times and prices, especially as despite some being launched at 6am, there still seem to be plenty of low-priced options available. The sale is for tickets to travel between December 1, 2023 and March 23, 2024, so it's ideal for anyone wanting to book a festive getaway or get some winter sun during the UK's coldest months. Flights start from £19.99, and destinations include Venice, Milan, Amsterdam, Paris and Majorca, amongst many more. When flight sales are launched, it's always worth being quick, as prices are based on demand, so the more people log onto easyJet's website and view certain flights, the more expensive they could get, and if you find your desired price and destination, you'll need to book it there and then to ensure that exact deal is secured. On MoneySavingExpert.com, it says that easyJet's press office commented: "On sale dates the system is always exceptionally busy. Our pricing is demand-led with fares starting low and rising as more seats are booked, so prices do increase when led by strong demand." As the reduced flights don't apply to every single date between December and March 23rd 2024, the way to get the cheapest flights is to be flexible with when you travel and from which airport, as this way you can ensure you are picking reduced seats for both the outward and return journeys.
