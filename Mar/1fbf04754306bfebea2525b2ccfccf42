On Wednesday, the Italian-American actress braved the Paris chill as she sauntered through the streets in a sheer black maxi dress. Going braless for the look, the 33-year-old bared all and showed off a small belly ring through the dress’ small cutout. The stylish star paired her daring look with a leather bolero sporting the Courrèges logo and kept her iconic red locks loose. Julia completed her look with banded black sunglasses and a nude lip. The actress has recently been turning heads in Italy as she sported some eye-popping, chic looks at Milan Fashion Week in February.
