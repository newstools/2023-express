Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip 4 is, without doubt, one of the best-looking foldables money can buy. However, if its price of £999 sounds like too much for your bank balance to cope with then there is now a slightly cheaper alternative. Oppo's new £849 N2 Flip was announced late last month with it featuring a design that clearly takes plenty of inspiration from its South Korean rival. Although things might seem more than a little familiar there are some advantages of choosing Oppo over Samsung. Firstly, the new N2 Flip gets a much bigger cover display with owners treated to a diddy 3.2-inch cover screen rather than the diddy 1.9-inch panel found on the Z Flip4. Then there's the battery as this latest bendable call maker not only gets a larger 4,300mAh power pack (the Z Flip has a 3700mAh battery) but also much faster charging with Oppo packing its impressive 44W SUPERVOOC refilling inside. That technology is able to take things from flat to 50 percent in just 23 minutes. Flip things open and there's an expansive 6.8-inch display which includes a fast 120Hz refresh rate for super smooth scrolling. Oppo also reckons this flexible panel can cope with being opened and closed 400,000 times without it breaking.
