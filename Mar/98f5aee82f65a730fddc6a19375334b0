A shopkeeper has hit out at the police after he was arrested for "beating up" a thief who he says fell through his roof. Ravinder Singh, 43, claimed he should be a "hero and held up on people's shoulders" for subduing Jason Urwin, 51, at his shop in Yorkshire. The father-of-three said he was arrested by Cleveland Police in "broad daylight" the day after the altercation, reports Yorkshire Live. Ravinder, nicknamed Bobby, retold his account of the dramatic moments where he and his friends fought Urwin "in self-defence" at 3am in his establishment, Ennis Square Store. He claims Uwin fell through the ceiling of the Premier store. Ravinder, originally from Punjab, India, said: "We caught him and we had a man-to-man fight. Me and this lad, one of my employees, we beat him up."
