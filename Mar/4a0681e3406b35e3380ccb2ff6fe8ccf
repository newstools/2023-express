Courteney Cox looked much younger than her 58 years as she made a very chic appearance in New York City today.  The star, who stepped out alongside her bodyguards, smiled and treated a few lucky fans to a selfie before continuing to promote her latest movie, Scream VI.  With a coffee cup in hand, Courteney looked stunning while unveiling her cleavage in an eye-catching purple shirt.  Friendsâ€™ Monica Geller star flashed her lace bra as she left the top buttons of her blouse undone, pairing the brightly coloured top with a pair of light grey suit trousers.  The brunette beauty, who is mum to her 18-year-old daughter Coco Arquette with ex-husband David Arquette, showed off her age-defying appearance with natural pink makeup and accessorised with a contrasting dark grey coat.  She completed the look with silver jewellery and waved sweetly at photographers as she made her way through the city.
