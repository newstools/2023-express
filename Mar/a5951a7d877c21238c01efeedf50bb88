Today sees the launch of Operation Homemaker, a ground-breaking plan to house the homeless and provide permanent homes for the most vulnerable households in Britain. The plan has been welcomed by the Housing Secretary, Michael Gove, and housebuilding chiefs.  Nearly 100,000 households in our country are without a home of their own – be that on the streets or in temporary accommodation. This includes a staggering 11,000 children in Bed and Breakfast accommodation. The dream of a decent permanent home to call their own is a distant prospect for these families. That’s why a new national mission is needed to house the homeless and build the affordable homes our country needs. The Homemaker plan is to build 100,000 homes over a year and a half. Homes to house the homeless and provide a permanent home for every family stuck in temporary accommodation like a bed and breakfast.  Not only will Operation Homemaker house the homeless, but it will also boost the economy. Building these homes would provide a £15 Billion stimulus to the economy. This would help to keep the building industry going and secure hundreds of jobs. The Homemaker plan has been presented to the Government. Next week’s Budget is an opportunity for the Government to show its support for this plan. No new money is required. Instead the call is for the Chancellor to use his budget to signal Government support to institutional investors and enable current existing budgets to be used to back the Homemaker plan. As a constituency MP, I do all I can to help get housing for the most vulnerable in the community I represent. Yet with homes in such short supply, it’s a real struggle.   Last week, I was helping Stacey, a single-parent mother with four children who had been made homeless. She and her children had been sleeping on the floor of a friend’s house for nights on end.
