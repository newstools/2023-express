All eyes are on Stamford Bridge today, with Chelsea set to face Borussia Dortmund in the second leg of their Champions League Round of 16 tie. They head into the match 1-0 down on aggregate, and defeat would only further worsen the mood at the club. Chelsea will not have been overly pleased to see Brentford beat Fulham on Monday night and confirm themselves as European contenders too. Goals from Ethan Pinnock, Ivan Toney and Mathias Jensen ensured that Thomas Frank’s side moved within touching distance of the top six. Elsewhere, Erik ten Hag is working hard to prevent his side’s 7-0 humiliation at the hands of Liverpool from derailing their season. Manchester United were on cloud nine heading into the match and speculation was growing that they could mount a title charge, though the defeat is at risk of altering the mentality in the camp entirely.
