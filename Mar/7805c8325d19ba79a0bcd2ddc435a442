Footage has captured the terrifying moment an Iraqi immigrant stabbed a teenager in a bid to get deported from the UK. Rebaz Mohammed, attacked 18-year-old university student Ellis Wheeler as he was walking through a park in Southampton in December. Video footage captured the attack, showing Mohammed pulling a kitchen knife from under his coat before stabbing the teenager in broad daylight. Mr Wheeler managed to get away but left fighting for his life and underwent surgery after suffering a puncture to his lung. Mohammed was arrested at the scene, telling police he carried out the attack because he wanted to be sent home. The 28-year-old admitted grievous bodily harm with intent and possessing a knife blade and was handed a six-year sentence.  Andrew Houston, prosecuting told the court that Mohammed has spoken to people who knew the immigration system and wanted to do something to get deported. He came to the UK illegally on a small boat and had been "making what effort he could to be deported", his defence said. Richard Tutt, mitigating said: "He believed, from what he had been told, that he needed to commit an offence that was serious enough. "He presents as a very naive person. He has experienced remorse, or at least sorrow."

Judge Brian Forster KC, sentencing said the attack was "indiscriminate". He said: "When anyone carries out an attack with a knife it is down to chance. "This was an indiscriminate attack. Any member of our community could have been the victim. "You were willing to inflict a serious injury with a weapon to achieve your own end. You could have killed the victim."
