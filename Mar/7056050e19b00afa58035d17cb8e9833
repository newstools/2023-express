This Friday's Euromillions Superdraw has lottery players across the country getting ready for the chance to win a staggering £114 million jackpot, which could roll to a record breaking £200m, and there's a way to get ten entries for just £1. Players entering the Euromillions Superdraw via a lottery syndicate company such as Lotto Social are able to get more entries for their money and this has led to it becoming a very popular way to play. The EuroMillions is played across 9 different countries - Ireland, Austria, Belgium, France, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom - and gives people the opportunity to win the massive jackpot. Lotto Social offers their members a way to get 10 entries for just £1, which is much less than the £25 it would typically cost. Lotto Social also gives members the chance to also play instant win games for free which offer cash prizes up to £7,000. Members get genuine tickets from the National Lottery when buying via Lotto Social meaning all proceeds still go to UK good causes. A Lotto Social spokesperson said: "Our innovative and fun way to play, means you are always in the big jackpots and big promotions, at a fraction of the cost, making it more affordable, as usually, one line will set you back £2.50. Our 10 lines for £1 is market leading, as we offer exclusively, free games for life. Our mission is to make the lottery affordable and fun."
