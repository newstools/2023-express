Two waxwork figures of Kate, Princess of Wales and Prince William have been mocked by the public, with the prince's one being likened to "Hugh Grant after 20 JÃ¤gerbombs". The models are on display at the Krakow Wax Museum, however royal fans have been shocked by Kate's "dishevelled" appearance and blonde hair, remarkably different to her real life brown locks.

The tourist attraction is rated only 2.5 stars on TripAdvisor, and offers waxwork models of famous faces including Tom Cruise, Vladimir Putin and Mr Bean. However holidaymakers in the Polish city have claimed the figures are of poor quality and look nothing like their famous counterparts. Graeme Bandeira said of the William model: "Hugh Grant after 20 Jagerbombs". Kate's figure meanwhile has the wrong colour hair and a much larger forehead than the princess. Nicky from Burton-on-Trent said of the museum: "One of the worst places I've ever been, just a good job the wax works had signs on each figure otherwise we'd have never have known who each one was. "It takes about five mins to walk around, we even saw a child crying, probably because she was so scared of the creepy figures."

During the drill Kate could be seen crouching in the snow wearing a beanie hat to keep out the cold.
