Amanda Holden, 52, has vowed to make the most of her sex appeal all the way up to her pensioner years, and tonight was no exception. Heading to the Shirley Valentine press night show in London with her mother Judith Harrison, she donned a black dress with cut-out sections revealing her waist and cleavage. Sheridan Smith, who once had an on-screen romance with Death in Paradise's Ralf Little in their Two Pints of Lager and A Packet of Crisps days, has already begun her 12-week-long stint portraying Shirley. The one-character play details the trials and tribulations of a Liverpool housewife, both before and after she experiences a transformative holiday that changes her world. As Amanda and Judith rocked up to the Duke of York Theatre in London, they were all smiles in anticipation of an entertaining night ahead.
