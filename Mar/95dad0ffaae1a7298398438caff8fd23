Becks is a British woman who has recently moved to the USA and has lived there for over three months now. She has been exploring the culture clashes between Brits and Americans on her TikTok page @becks.shaw and has recently spoken out about the things she does not like about North America. In her video, Becks explained some of the things about the US she “thought would be great” but turned out to be “a little bit sh**”. Becks first issue was the “level of service” she has received at supermarket stores. She clarified that her annoyance does not apply to restaurant service and also varies “by brand and varies by state.”However, Becks said that “largely overall” she feels like supermarket staff “would rather die than actually help you with anything.” Becks also had an issue with America’s “beloved IHOP” and apologized in advance in case she offended any of her audience. She said: “I don’t necessarily have a problem with the food, but I don’t think you should be eating somewhere that smells like that.” The Briton went on to explain her issue with the smell of the restaurant. She said: “I don’t have kids, but if I had then of them and they lived in one room together and they were all under four years old, that room would smell like an IHOP."
