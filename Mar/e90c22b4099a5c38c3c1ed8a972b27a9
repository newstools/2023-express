The late Queen Elizabeth has been accused of lacking "steel" when it came to dealing with Prince Harry whereas King Charles is better at "confronting" his son, a royal historian has claimed. It was confirmed last week that Harry and Meghan Markle had been asked to vacate their UK home at Frogmore Cottage by the King following their ongoing rift with the Firm. Tune into our Royal Family Snapchat Show, every Monday exclusively on Snapchat A spokesperson for the couple said last week: "We can confirm The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have been requested to vacate their residence at Frogmore Cottage." The decision to evict them from Frogmore was not one the Queen would have made, according to royal historian Robert Lacey. He told People magazine: "Charles is now the guardian of the institution. The King just can't sit back. "It shows Charles has a steel that his mother lacked. The Queen could never bring herself to confront Harry as an adult."  It is understood the Sussexes knew about the eviction prior to the publication of Harry's memoir Spare in January and are not trying to overturn the decision. A source told the publication that although the timing is "unfortunate" due to the King's upcoming Coronation, Harry and Meghan are "matter-of-fact" about the situation.  Despite stepping down from official royal duties in 2020 Harry has always expressed his love and respect for his grandmother.
