Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will reportedly receive a frosty reception from some Royal Family members if they attend King Charles's Coronation in May as expected. The couple have been officially invited to the event on May 6 but have not yet confirmed their attendance. However, some royals are said to have privately told friends they plan to give them the "cold shoulder" and "hope they are seated in Iceland", according to the Daily Mail. They will also not be invited to take part in the official Buckingham Palace balcony appearance. A friend of the family said: "They will be given the cold shoulder by very many relatives. One said to me, 'I hope theyâ€™ll be seated in Iceland'. Many of the family just want nothing more to do with them. If they have to see them at the Coronation then so be it, but they do not want to socialise with them." It is expected the family will stay at Frogmore Cottage during their time in the UK, despite being asked to vacate the property by the King in January. While their children Archie and Lilibet, now to be known as Prince and Princess, may travel with them it is thought they are too young to attend the Coronation. FOLLOW BELOW FOR MORE ROYAL UPDATES....
