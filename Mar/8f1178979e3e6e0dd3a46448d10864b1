A frustrated mother travelled for more than an hour to a theme park with three children - only to be denied use of her voucher. Amy Agnew, 29, says an employee at Robin Hoods Wheelgate in Farnsfield, Nottinghamshire, conceded there was a "typo" on her coupon which had wrongly claimed families could enter for free.  She took her two children and one of their friends to the attraction on Wednesday March 1 - a day teachers were striking - but a staff member wanted to charge £21.90 for the group. Amy, from Branston, Lincolnshire, said: "I said 'I didn’t think I had to pay?' and she said it was only valid for one person. "I thought I shouldn't have had to pay coming in then as it clearly stated it was for a family of four. I was in a position where I thought I couldn't really go back as I had three children who were really excited to go." The mother said staff took "no ownership" of the mistake, reports Nottinghamshire Live.  She said she was only told of the "typo" when she asked a worker on the way out, but was not offered any compensation. "People are going to be turning up with all these tickets thinking it's valid for four people and it's not, it's only for one," Amy said. "With the cost of living crisis there's going to be people who want a cheaper or free day out, but it's not going to be happening when they turn up. "I was out of pocket by about £40 because I paid £21.90 to get in and I didn't bring in packed lunches as I wanted to support the business, so I paid for lunch as well." A Robin Hoods Wheelgate spokesman said: "We apologise for the inconvenience. Our printers have taken responsibility for misprint." He added staff will contact Amy to "honour the four-person admission".
