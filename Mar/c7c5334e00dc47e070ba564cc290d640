Piers Morgan has hit out at the Sussexes after reports emerged that the royal couple have been evicted from the picturesque 10-bedroom property on the Windsor Estate. It has been reported that Frogmore Cottage, which was given to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex on their wedding day by the Queen, will now be given to the disgraced Prince Andrew by King Charles.    It has been revealed that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were evicted from their Windsor Estate home just 24 hours after the Duke’s bombshell memoir ‘Spare’ hit shelves. Reports claim King Charles kickstarted the process of evicting the royal couple out of Frogmore Cottage on January 11, just a day after the book was released. Piers Morgan, writing in his column in the Sun, stated that the King “has had enough”. He wrote: “King Charles has had enough. “That’s the obvious conclusion from The Sun’s bombshell scoop that Britain’s new Monarch is evicting Prince Harry and his wife Meghan from Frogmore Cottage, their UK home in Windsor.” READ MORE: Meghan 'blowing through' small fortune after marrying 'pauper prince'   The broadcaster added that the monarch “won’t have taken this decision lightly” and “has made it clear to people that he still loves his second son”. He wrote: “But there comes a point in every such dispute when a line must be drawn in the sand. “And for Charles, that line came in the shape of Harry’s tell-all book Spare which dumped a Grand Canyon sized load of rotten, stinking manure over his family. “I don’t blame him. If one of my three sons publicly repeatedly trashed our family in the way Harry’s trashed his, they wouldn’t be getting the ash from my annual Christmas Day cigar, let alone a luxury home.

He stated: “Charles must be firm, and not include the Sussexes on the list.” It is not yet known whether the Duke and Duchess will attend, but it is believed that the pair have been invited. Built in 1801, Frogmore Cottage is part of the Crown Estate and housed the Sussexes when they resided in the UK. However, the couple only lived in the home for six months before quitting their roles as working royals and moving across the pond. Express.co.uk have approached the Duke and Duchess for comment.
