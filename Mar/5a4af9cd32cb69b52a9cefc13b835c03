Four Americans have been shot and snatched in a city on the US-Mexico border, the FBI has claimed. The unnamed Americans were kidnapped after gunmen opened fire on their vehicle in the northern Mexico border city of Matamoros, the FBI said Sunday. The four had entered Matamoros, across from Brownsville, Texas, on Friday. They were travelling in a white minivan with North Carolina license plates. The FBI San Antonio Division office said the vehicle came under fire shortly after it entered Mexico. The local FBI office said: "All four Americans were placed in a vehicle and taken from the scene by armed men."  The FBI is offering a $50,000 (£41,637) reward for the return of the victims and the arrest of the culprits. Matamoros is reportedly home to warring factions of the Gulf drug cartel. The shootouts in Matamoros were so bad that the U.S. Consulate issued an alert about the danger on Friday. Tamaulipas state police said people had been killed and injured Friday, but did not say how many. The FBI asked witnesses or those with information to call its San Antonio division at 210-225-6741.   A horrific video shared on social media purported to show the moment of the kidnapping. Express.co.uk is not sharing the graphic video, but it shows one woman being walked into the back of a pick-up truck as two more people are dumped in the back after her. It is not clear if the other two people in put in the back were alive. In the video, they appear to be unconscious. This is a developing story and will be updated with further information when it arrives.
