Queen Rania, 52, took to Instagram with a beautiful video showing archive footage of her daughter Princess Iman, 26, who is getting married this week. The Queen captioned the video saying: "The first time I held my baby girl, I knew my life would never be the same.  "In a week, she will be a bride. My precious Iman, I am so happy for you and so proud of everything that you are. "Thank you to the very talented @elissazkh and to the brilliant @imarwankhoury for this wonderful gift and for your amazing ability to capture sentiments so beautifully." In one of the still shots in the video, Princess Iman could be seen wearing a beautiful silver tiara, which many assume is the diadem she will wear at her wedding. This tiara is the same diamond tiara that Queen Rania has worn many times.

The frame is worn wrapped around the back of the head, indicating that the piece was originally a necklace. Queen Rania first wore her diamond tiara for a spectacular State Banquet hosted by the late Queen and Prince Philip in 2001. Therefore, this royal tiara has a strong link to the UK, having made its debut when in the presence of the late Queen Elizabeth II.   She once more wore the diamond tiara two days later when King Abdullah and Queen Rania hosted a Return Banquet. The diamond tiara was also worn by Queen Rania for a portrait in 2001, which was the last time it was made visible to the public. Because it had only been worn three times in 2001, it was considered that the tiara was a loan. When Princess Iman wore the diadem in the photograph that Queen Rania published in an Instagram video, it is now obvious that the tiara belongs to the monarch.  It is very likely that Princess Iman will don the diamond tiara for her wedding, which is happening this Sunday. Iman is engaged to Jimmy Thermiótis, 28, a Venezuelan businessman, and the two will tie the knot on Sunday, March 12. Queen Rania famously did not wear a tiara at her royal wedding to King Abdullah II in 1993. She wore a Bruce Oldfield wedding dress, which was a designer loved by the late Princess Diana, with short sleeves and gold detailing to the ceremony.   The jacket that covered the top of the gown and a large belt that held it in place made the outfit stand out. She wore a headband with her hair up in a large bun instead of a tiara. The headdress, which had a big veil attached to it, went well with her white and gold gown. She also wore pearl drop earrings with diamond studs that had smaller pearls on the ear lobe and a larger pearl hanging down.
