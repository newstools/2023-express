Maya Jama's dress was mocked relentlessly by Twitter viewers as she presented the Love Island finale on Monday evening. The bubbly presenter has boasted a wardrobe estimated at Â£20,000 over the course of the series, with some edgy outfits earning admiration from viewers. However, her final dress was deemed a disappointment, with some fans exclaiming that the ruched purple dress left her looking like a Quality Street wrapper. That said, the 28-year-old, who has Swedish and Somalian ancestry, still looked sensational to many devotees - no matter what she wore. "Not Maya Jama dressing like a red cabbage and still looking unreal!" exclaimed one member of the Twitterverse, while another echoed: "Only Maya can dress as a cabbage and still pull it off."
