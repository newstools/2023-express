An 11-year-oldboy is a step closer to realising his dream of becoming Prime Minister.  Harry Acheampong has been chosen as the first interim PM for the Children's Parliament. The position gives him a platform to highlight the environmental causes close to his heart like water pollution. The pupil from St Michael's School, Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, was among 19 MPs on the junior parliament select committee on water management and sustainability who last October grilled industry representatives. The Wakelet Microsoft 365 Children's Parliament, backed by the Daily Express, was the brainchild of murdered MP Sir David Amess.
