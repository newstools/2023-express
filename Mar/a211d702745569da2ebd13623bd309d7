Several explosions have been reported in Crimea with military bases believed to have been the intended targets. Large plumes of smoke were seen in Bakhchysarai near Sevastopol and Yalta after the missiles hit.  Sevastopol, along with the rest of Crimea, is internationally recognised as part of Ukraine, but it has been occupied by Russia since February 27, 2014. Russia then annexed Crimea on March 18, 2014. Speaking earlier today Russia’s Defence Ministry said it prevented a massive drone attack on Crimea. According to Russian state media, air defences shot down six drones, while electronic warfare systems disabled four others.  Meanwhile, one of Volodymyr Zelenskyy's top advisers, Mykhailo Podolyak, denied today that Ukraine had used drones to attack Russian territory following official statements from Russia that Ukraine had targeted infrastructure deep inside Russia. Writing on Twitter Mr Podolyak said: “Ukraine does not strike on the territory of the Russian Federation. “Ukraine is waging a defensive war with the aim of de-occupying all its territories.” He suggested the targeting of Russian infrastructure was the result of "internal attacks."

In the past, Ukrainian officials have stopped short of claiming responsibility for attacks in Russia. But they have also insisted that Ukraine has the right to strike any target on Russian territory in response to its aggression.
