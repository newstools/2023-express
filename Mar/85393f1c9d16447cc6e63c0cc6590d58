Gene Hackman, 93, was photographed in Santa Fe, New Mexico, earlier this week during a trip to a gas station. The Hollywood legend grabbed snacks and a coffee from his local gas station before filling up his truck. The father-of-three, who has not been seen for years, wore jeans and a grey fleece over a long-sleeved top. He tucked his grey hair under a beige cap and had a pair of dark sunglasses to hand. The two-time Academy Award winner's last movie role was in Welcome to Mooseport (2004). Before this, he was one of the most prolific actors in the industry with roles in The French Connection (1971), Mississippi Burning (1989) and Unforgiven (1993).
