The Banshees of Inisherin star was in the running for Best Actor, and although he lost out to Brendan Fraser, still seemingly had an eventful evening. Colin made a rare public appearance alongside his youngest son Henry Tadeusz and had fans fawning over the debonair pair, with the proud Irishman also sporting an Ireland pin on his lapel. Colin, 46, and Henry, 13, donned matching black tuxedos for the 95th Academy Awards, posing alongside some of Hollywood’s finest in California on Sunday. The pair proudly posed with Colin’s co-star Brendan Gleeson, who was also up for his very first Oscar, Best Supporting Actor, for The Banshees of Inisherin. In January, Colin took home the Golden Globe award for Best Actor for his role in the comedy-drama.
