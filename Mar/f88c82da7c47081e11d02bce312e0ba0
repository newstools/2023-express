A 19-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of abducting a teenager who has not been seen since Friday morning. Joddielea, 15, was last seen near the Meadowhall shopping centre in Sheffield at around 8.15am on that day.   When she was last seen she was wearing blue jeans, white trainers, a short black coat with a fur hood and a black cross-body bag. She is described as white, around 5ft 3in tall, and has shoulder-length straight brown hair. The Sun reports that the man has been bailed pending further enquiries. South Yorkshire Police is very concerned about the girl's welfare and has launched an appeal for information to help them find the missing teenager.        In a statement the force said: "Have you seen Joddielea? Do you have any information about where she might be? "If you can help, please call 101 quoting incident number 200 of 10 March 2023." South Yorkshire Police made the appeal for the public's help on Twitter and this has been retweeted hundreds of times.
