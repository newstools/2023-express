 The 26-year-old British national was arrested after raping a woman at a hotel on the popular Spanish island. The incident occurred last Friday around 7pm in Santa Ponsa, a coastal town in western Majorca.    The assailant resisted being arrested and headbutted one of the officers who intervened, local media reported. It was reported a friend of the victim alerted the hotel reception of the incident, prompting emergency services to rush to the scene. The victim was transferred to the Son Espases hospital where she underwent an examination. The hotel receptionist called the Civil Guard and the officers arrested the alleged attacker.    The Judicial Police took charge of the investigation. The civil guards went to the room where the events occurred and noted that there were traces of blood on the bed, local news outlet Ultima Hora revealed.
