The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have decided their children will be known as Prince and Princess, it is understood. Meghan and Harry have hinted their daughter has received a royal title in a statement regarding her christening. A spokesperson for the pair told People magazine: "I can confirm that Princess Lilibet Diana was christened on Friday, March 3 by the Archbishop of Los Angeles, the Rev John Taylor." The use of the word Princess suggested Meghan and Harry have had time to consider whether to have their children known with the royal titles they are entitled to have and have decided in favour of it. The 1917 letters patent issued by King George V instruct that only a restricted number of people can be given a royal title and the HRH style. Among them are the children of the sons of the monarch - in this case, Prince Harry.
