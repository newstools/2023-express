At least two people have been taken to hospital after a fire broke out at a skyscraper being built in Hong Kong. Scaffolding all over the building was wrapped in flames with burning embers falling from the building in Middle Road.  The fire broke out at the site in Tsim Sha Tsui at about 11pm local time on Thursday (March 2). The site is surrounded by a shopping centre, residential and commercial buildings with several hotels in the same area. Several floors of the skyscraper have been ablaze with burning debris falling onto the streets below. Police said four buildings nearby also caught on fire, but those blazes have been put out.   South China Morning Post said those injured are reportedly motorists. They were taken to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in the Yau Ma Tei district of Hong Kong for treatment.  There were reports of explosions heard while firefighters used jets in a bid to extinguish the flames. The fire started at the site of The Marinersâ€™ Club redevelopment project in the densely populated district.  The fire was categorised three out of five for seriousness by the Hong Kong Fire Services Department. People living nearby were urged to shut their windows and doors and to remain calm by the emergency service.
