Rita Ora was inundated with messages as the Masked Singer judge put her slimmed down physique on display as the beauty posed for a photoshoot. The singer, 32, slipped into a cream bralet and accessorised her look with faux fur shoulder detail as she posed on the steps of a cosy looking home in Los Angeles. The Black Widow hitmaker paired her attire with black lace trousers with a floral print. She elongated her long legs with a pair of open-toe sandals as she flashed her toned stomach. Rita captioned the post: "Mid week mayhem - [rain cloud emoji] - oh and I golfed - kinda."(sic)
