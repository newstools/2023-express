Max Verstappen’s title defence gets underway in just four days at the Bahrain Grand Prix as the 2023 season roars into life. Red Bull appear on top after the first three days of pre-season testing with Ferrari and Mercedes nipping at their heels. Days before the start of the new campaign, Lewis Hamilton has been urged to boycott races to show his support for human rights issues. Hamilton has been a leading campaigner at races in the Middle East but politicians feel he could go further by refusing to race. Meanwhile, F1 pundits have opened up about Verstappen’s “secret weapon” as he targets a third successive Drivers’ Championship. It comes after Red Bull was slapped with a reduction in wind tunnel testing for 2023 after breaking F1's strict budget cap rules.
