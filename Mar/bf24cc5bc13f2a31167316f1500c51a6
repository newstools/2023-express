Fans of the TV presenter have been leaving comments on her latest Instagram post, saying how much they 'love' her dress.  The dress is a chic midi-length which can easily be worn alone once it gets warmer, or layered with a jumper or jacket. With a gorgeous floral print in a pink shade, the piece is versatile for different occasions, as it can be dressed down for a daytime outfit or dressed up for a wedding guest outfit. The tie-waist helps create a flattering silhouette, as it can be adjusted to accentuate the waist. With collar detail and a button-up front, the dress can be adjusted for smart or casual looks and is an easy throw-on piece for an effortless look. The dress also comes in a blue shade, with the same shape, design and silky-soft feel, but instead of floral, the pattern is a blurred animal print. The blue colour is available in all sizes on the Ro&Zo website, and the pink shade is due to be restocked in the next couple of weeks for those that want to buy Holly's exact dress. Shoppers have been commenting on Holly's Instagram post, with some calling it 'beautiful'. One person commented: ''Morning gorgeous Holly! Looking fab and colourful with a touch of Spring attire, stunning!!!'' Another added: ''Beautiful dress you always look amazing!!!
