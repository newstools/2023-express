UK Power Networks says that at least part of the issue is caused by engineers having to turn off power in the Burgess Hill area so they can fix a faulty substation in the Burgess Hill area, after it was damaged on Thursday. It tweeted: "Weâ€™ve had to temporarily turn off power in the Burgess Hill area so that we can carry out further safety checks after a fault in a substation on March 9. "Our teams are working hard to reconnect supplies as quickly as is safely possible."  We'll be bringing you the very latest updates, pictures and video on this breaking news story.
