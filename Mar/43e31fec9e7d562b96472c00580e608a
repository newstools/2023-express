A black labrador has been rescued after being swept out to sea at Seaton Sluice in Northumberland. The dog was playing fetch with its owner when the strong winds and currents dragged him away. A rescue team was called out to save Shaddah, and the RNLI team also captured footage of the rescue. The video shows rescuers scrambling to reach Shaddad as he desperately tried to keep himself afloat. The dog was dragged onto the RNLI boat and safely returned to his owner who was waiting from the shore. Posting the video on the RNLI Facebook page, the charity said: “Shaddah's not the sharpest knife in the drawer, so when he ran into the sea to fetch a ball and then kept going, his owner faced a dilemma - try to rescue Shaddah, or do something else? “They called the RNLI. If you’re dog-walking close to cliff edges or fast-flowing rivers, put them on a lead. Elsewhere, if they fall in the water or get stuck in mud, don't go after them. “Move to a place they can get to safely, and call - they'll probably get out. If you're worried, call 999 or 112 and ask for the Coastguard.” The RNLI recently released the footage of the rescue, which took place in March 2021. The charity is launching a safety campaign aimed at dog walkers to ensure pets are safe while out on walks near coastal areas.
