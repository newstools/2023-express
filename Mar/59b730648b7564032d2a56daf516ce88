Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has admitted he "gave a kid to security" during the wild celebrations after his side's epic comeback win over Bournemouth on Saturday. The Gunners looked set to suffer an embarrassing defeat to Bournemouth after Marcos Senesi gave the visitors a 2-0 lead after the break.  But Arsenal embarked on an impressive comeback culminating in wild scenes after Reiss Nelson scored a last-minute winner. Fans in the stands were jumping up and down with the Emirates bouncing while players and staff were seen running all around. And the celebrations may have gotten out of hand at one stage with Arteta noting that a young supporter made his way onto the pitch. "You lose sight of where you are," he said. "I started to run and I didn't really know where I was running to.  "Then I saw a kid next to me. I gave him to security. Just looking at the faces of everybody... with those smiles, that joy in their eyes. It's great to live." Arteta paid credit to the crowd for helping inspire their epic comeback after Thomas Partey scored their first of the match. "Everybody is overwhelmed a bit," he added.  "It was madness from the first minute of the game where we defended so poorly and then you have to climb a mountain. After that donâ€™t lose the shape and try to score the first one. "We did that and once we did that the atmosphere and the place changed. We generated a lot of chances. I thought the subs made a huge impact. So happy for Reiss after he made a huge impact."
