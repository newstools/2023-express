 Earlier this week, a small London art space was filled with celebrities as painter David Hockney showed some “old friends” his new project. The celebrated artist launched the Lightroom at space in London’s Kings Cross with his immersive experience titled: David Hockney: Bigger & Closer. The 85-year-old has been avidly involved in the creation of this experience, and found himself earlier this week surrounded by Tom Hanks, Sir Paul McCartney, Sir Elton John and Jools Holland. As photographer Rich Hockney captured the unexpected collection of stars, fans awed at the images capturing “an incredible audience”. Laurenhockney penned: “What a bunch of legends,” and Matty_mayes added: “What a picture mate.”
