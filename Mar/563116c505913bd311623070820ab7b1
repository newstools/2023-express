Lancashire police have confirmed that a murder investigation has been launched after the death of a patient in a care home specialising in dementia care. The suspect has been identified but no arrests have been made at this time. Lancashire Constabulary rushed to Hulton House Care Residence following reports of an assault.  Officers found a man in his 70s with a serious head injury. He was rushed to the hospital for treatment but died five days later on November 8. The attack happened on November 3 of last year at 12.30am at the facility on Lightfoot Green Lane in Preston. Lancashire Police said: "Our thoughts remain with his family at this extremely difficult time. They are being supported by specially trained officers." They added a suspect has been identified but no arrests have been made yet. The death is now being treated as a murder investigation and enquiries are continuing.  The care home was handed over an "inadequate" rating by Care Quality Commission (CQC) last November, which raised concerns over the management of risk to people living there. After their visit last November, the CQC published damning findings in a report which found mismanagement of medicines, behaviour management, fire evacuation points and a lack of personal preference in care plans. All these reasons led the Commission to give the care home the lowest rating a service can receive.
