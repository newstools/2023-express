Astrid Wett beats AJ Bunker via a majority decision to set up the long-awaited grudge match with Elle Brooke. The judges scored the fight 29-28 Wett, 29-29 and 29-28 Wett. Both women took to the centre of the ring right from the off as Wett opened up with a big right hand that snapped back the head of Bunker. Chaos ensued as both women flailed their arms recklessly, Wett coming out the better – backing up the ex-Love Island contestant into the corner. In the second round, Wett came back out looking for blood but walked straight into a right cross that dislodged her mouthpiece. As the action resumed, Bunker began to establish her jab circling away from Wett’s backhand. However, Bunker was in trouble again early in the third as multiple shots appeared to stun her. Blood gushing from her nose, Wett poured forward but appeared to run out of steam too quickly and wasn’t able to follow up her significant strikes.  Wett was given the nod to set up the much-anticipated showdown with OnlyFans rival Brooke. "I'm going to keep this belt, Elle I know everybody says you want it but the weight is difficult," said Wett. "If you want the belt, you'll come down. If you win a belt I'll come up. So, yeah. I'm happy with mine." But Brooke was quick to shut it down. "No. I think I want bigger badder things, no offence. Ronda Rousey or Astrid Wett?" MORE BOXING NEWS...
