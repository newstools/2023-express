This is the unbelievable moment a 200 square foot high-street billboard went up in flames. The huge hoarding, positioned next to a Burger King in Middlesbrough, was given the “flame-grilled” treatment – much like one of the chain’s burgers. And it sported a Doritos tortilla chip ad before being left chargrilled – alluding to a collaboration between the two brands. Locals were left stunned, with hundreds gathering to take pictures and videos which have spilled onto social media. Resident Olivia McHale, 28, said: “I just can't believe it. It's just not the sort of thing you expect to see in Middlesbrough – things like this don't happen here.” The controlled fire took place shortly after dusk, with professionals on the scene to ensure safety for people in the area, as well as to clear up the site. Another local, Matthew Donnachie, 26, who witnessed the chargrilled billboard, said: “A Doritos billboard burning next to a restaurant that flame-grills its burgers. “Seriously clever. Love the irony. There's definitely more to this than meets the eye.” A spokesman from the snack brand, which is set to team up with the fast food chain to launch flame-grilled Whopper Doritos, said: “People often say there’s no smoke without fire, and a few onlookers started to put two-and-two together. “Our collaboration is something only few would expect, and we look forward to many more being surprised in the coming days following the launch of our Flame Grilled Whopper chips, as they taste so similar to the real thing. The triangle Whopper is here.”
