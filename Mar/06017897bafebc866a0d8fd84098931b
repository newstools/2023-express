Second song in the set Nighttalk from their new album has a real dance groove with its central riff and the passionate lyric ‘Something just made me be real with you’ seemingly strikes a chord with a crowd consisting of predominantly twenty-somethings at this aptly intimate venue, the atmosphere buzzing with a sense of youthful abandon. Their next song has a steady chord progression that creates a fuller, more anthemic sound. Yearning, scratching guitars play alongside the lyric ‘I’m sticking around you for good’ driving an emotive sound, Harrod’s voice pure yet pained and exhibiting clear vocal versatility. In an excited aside to the crowd the lead singer marks the show in anticipation of the midnight release of their latest album Blue Hymn, the ethereal album opener Beyond Dreaming sounding brilliant live with its distorted lyrics set against synths. As expressed in their album press release, Giant Party’s main songwriter says of new single Find A Feeling To Share - “This song was essentially born out of mental exhaustion. I’d spent the best part of 20 years being closed, hanging onto past situations and letting it define how I responded to my life in the present. So it’s really just a mantra to myself to counter that”. Already a polished live outfit, they are destined to for bigger heights with their ability to truly engage with a Giant Party vibe that they brought to the Victoria tonight.
