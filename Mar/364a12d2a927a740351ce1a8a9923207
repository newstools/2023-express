Premier League official Simon Hooper appears to have turned himself into a meme after eagle-eyed viewers spotted the referee copying THAT David Brent dance during Manchester City's match against Newcastle on Saturday. Newcastle were looking to break up the field with Callum Wilson trying to hold off Manuel Akanji while waiting for the ball to come to his feet.  The England striker fell to the ground and pleaded with the referee to award his side a free-kick. But Hooper waved away the protests in a rather unique manner to the frustration of Wilson. The Premier League official was seen waving his arms from side to side, which several viewers immediately saw similarities to the infamous David Brent dance from the popular UK television show 'The Office'. @garyp1971 wrote: "Didn't realise David Brent was reffing City v Newcastle?!?" @JoeThomas182 tweeted out a gif of Brent's dance, adding: "Simon Hooper letting out his inner David Brent."  @Jordan_J_Thomas posted: "The ref in the Man City v Newcastle game just cracked out the David Brent dance in the middle of the pitch." @Scottyirl said: "Hahaha Simon Hooper doing his David Brent impression." @Jonmod80 joked: "Did the referee in the Man City v Newcastle game just do a David Brent impression."  Hooper appeared to be gesturing that there was six of one and half a dozen of the other in the challenge between Akanji and Wilson. While the City defender was clearly grabbing on to the Newcastle forward, Hooper believes Wilson was also holding at Akanji's shirt. Newcastle found themselves a goal down against the reigning Premier League champions after a brilliant solo goal from Phil Foden. The England international picked up the ball on the right flank before cutting into the box, evading a couple of challenges before neatly finishing past Nick Pope. Newcastle had chances of their own to equalise in the first half with Wilson scuffing his lines from inside the box.
