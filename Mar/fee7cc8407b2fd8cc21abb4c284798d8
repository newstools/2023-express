Shoppers have been leaving reviews on the products, with some saying they would 'highly recommend' The Glow Booster. Giulia F said: ''Even after a week of using this, I can feel the difference in my nails growing faster and stronger. Been looking for an accessible source of collagen for a while and this one is perfect. Super easy in a smoothie, porridge or even to drink with water as it has little to no taste. Would highly recommend!'' ZoeyR commented: ''I've tried several brands of collagen powder and can honestly say this one has been the best yet. My skin is glowing and I've really noticed a difference in just 2 weeks. I usually mix in with some of The Lean protein from Innermost into a delicious shake. If you've been looking for a collagen powder that actually works, this is well worth a try!'' IzzyHill also added: ''I love this glow booster, I can already see a difference in my skin due to the 3 nourishing ingredients. I have been looking for a collagen product for ages that is easy to consume and this is the one!''
