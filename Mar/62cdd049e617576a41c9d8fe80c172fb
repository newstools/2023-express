A mob of vigilantes took to the streets to hunt down a killer 90 minutes after he'd murdered their friend. The men tracked Anthony George after he'd stabbed 25-year-old Tyrone Williamson to death in Bolton, Greater Manchester. A barrister told Brendan Carney, Adam Disa-Green and Jason Wilding that George's attack was "not a lawful excuse" for "retribution and revenge". Carney, 27, was found guilty of wounding with intent while Disa-Green, 22, and 28-year-old Wilding admitted the offence. They'll be sentenced at a later date, Manchester Evening News reports. But Nathan Carney-Williamson, 30, Roy Meanley, 29, and Thomas Lynch, 36, all denied wounding with intent and were cleared after a trial. Jaime Hamilton KC, prosecuting, had said: "Retribution and revenge, no matter how serious what Anthony George may have just done, does not provide a lawful excuse for exacting violence against the person that you believe is responsible." The four-week trial at Manchester Crown Court heard George, 42, had been accused of stealing Mr Williamson's phone and a row ensued between the pair on the day of the fatal stabbing. George, fuelled by vodka and cannabis, said "watch what’s going to happen to them" before knifing Mr Williamson three times with severe force. Tyrone died in the hours following the fatal attack, at about 6.30pm, on Saturday, December 11, 2021. In the aftermath of the killing a group of men went out looking for George to seek "revenge", the prosecution alleged. They found George out with a friend later that evening, at about 8.15pm. One of the men chased George's pal away while others began a brutal attack, it was said. George was stabbed five times, as well as being punched, kicked and stamped on. He spent three weeks in hospital. In December last year, George was found guilty of murdering Mr Williamson. He was handed a life sentence, and ordered to serve at least 21 years in prison.
