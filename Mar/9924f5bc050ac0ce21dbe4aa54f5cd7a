A couple who rented a £2million Airbnb mansion during lockdown have been fined – after more than 50 gatecrashers turned up for a party and left the plush property trashed. Students Adekoya Odukoya and Suliat Okunlola, both 20, booked the home for up to four people for two days in March, 2021. The millionaires row mansion in Sandbanks, Dorset, was in a Tier 4 Covid area, where all gatherings were banned. But the pair “gave the location away” when they posted updates about their £500 getaway for Odukoya’s 19th birthday, Poole Magistrates Court heard. And a raucous party broke out after dozens of people descended. Angry neighbours called police, but by the time officers broke up the bash, the damage was done. Owner Nick Briant, 38, said: “It cost me about £1,000 of deep cleaning, cleaning carpets and repainting walls. There was a lot of drug paraphernalia – hundreds of laughing gas canisters.” Odukoya, of Watford, Herts, and Okunlola, of Peckham, south east London, admitted holding a gathering of more than 30 in a Tier 4 area. They were both fined £100 and ordered to pay £119 in costs.
