Dame Helen Mirren, 77, looked nothing short of stunning as she graced the red carpet at the London screening of her latest movie, a sequel to the hit film Shazam!, entitled Fury Of The Gods. The age-defying actress continued to rock her longer blonde locks, but switched up her look by opting to tie her tresses back in an elegant topknot. Oscar winner Helen, who plays Hespera in the superhero blockbuster, posed up a storm in a very on-theme hot pink cape featuring a statement oversized bow, which she paired with black trousers and towering high heels. Helen accessorised with a pair of sheer black gloves, looking every inch the Hollywood heroine. Dame Helen enjoyed reuniting with her Shazam! Fury Of The Gods co-stars, Rachel Zegler, 21, and Lucy Liu, 54, who both looked incredible in floorlength gowns for the star-studded premiere.
