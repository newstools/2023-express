The Miami Dolphins are set to trade for Jalen Ramsey in a blockbuster move. The Los Angeles Rams had made no secret that a few of their superstar players were available, as they rebuild their roster following their Super Bowl championship in 2022. And after releasing Bobby Wagner, they now look destined to move on from Ramsey too, with reports a deal is now close.  CBS reporter Josina Anderson tweeted: "I’m told the Rams & the Dolphins are in deep discussions on a trade for CB Jalen Ramsey. A deal is not finalized, but there’s “a high likelihood” it happens, at this time, per a league source. A lot of teams are interested in Ramsey, but the focus is on where he wants to be." Ramsey himself has reacted to the news, posting the caption 'Mood', with a video of rapper Lil Yachty performing to a hyped up Miami crowd, with the cornerback seemingly pleased to be on the move. Since being drafted, Ramsey has been the best cornerback in the league, and continues to play at an elite level into his eighth season.  The Rams gave up two first-round picks for Ramsey in 2019, and have now agreed to deal him to Miami for a third round pick and tight end Hunter Long. It's a surprisingly cheap price that the Dolphins have paid, getting one of the best defensive players in the league without giving up huge assets. The Dolphins will now be without their first, third, fourth or fifth round picks in this years draft. For the Rams, this looks to be the end of their Super Bowl window, as they start to rebuild their roster. The move saves the team $5.6 million in cap space, but will cost them a whopping $19 million in dead cap - meaning they will not be able to use that money until next off-season.
