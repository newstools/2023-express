Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are unlikely to play any role in the Coronation besides that of spectators if they decide to attend the event. As they are no longer senior members of the Firm, the Duke and Duchess are not expected to take part in the royal processions scheduled for the day King Charles and Queen Camilla will be crowned side by side at Westminster Abbey. Meghan and Harry are also unlikely to be invited on the balcony of Buckingham Palace alongside the King, Queen, the Prince and Princess of Wales and other full-time working royals, if the King is to follow the blueprint created by the late Queen for her Platinum Jubilee celebrations last June. Meghan and Harry have received the invite to the Coronation, one of their spokesmen confirmed. However, he did not disclose whether they can be expected to be in London in May. He said: "I can confirm The Duke has recently received email correspondence from His Majesty's office regarding the Coronation. An immediate decision on whether The Duke and Duchess will attend will not be disclosed by us at this time." They will have until early April to communicate to officials whether they will travel across the pond to see Charles and Camilla being crowned.
