A pensioner was shunted down a moving escalator after teenage boys "let go of an empty shopping trolley from the top". The incident, which happened on Friday, February 24, is said to have taken place at Asda supermarket in Gravesend, Kent. The alleged assault is now the centre of a probe by Kent Police, who are appealing for witnesses to come forward.    The victim, in his 80s, was going up the escalator at the town's Imperial Retail Park between 6.20pm and 6.35pm when he plunged back down to the ground floor. He suffered head injuries and cuts to his hands, and later went to hospital as a precaution. Kent Police has now released a description of the suspects. It says they are described as being aged between 12 and 16 years old. One had brown hair and was wearing a grey puffer jacket, black tracksuit and black trainers. The other two had black hair and were respectively wearing an all black tracksuit and an all red tracksuit.     Police Sergeant Andrew Ferguson said: "The elderly victim is fortunate that he did not suffer more serious injuries and we have been trying to identify the teenage boys involved in this incident. "There were other shoppers who will have seen what happened and we are appealing for witnesses, or anyone with information that may assist our enquiries, to call the appeal line."
