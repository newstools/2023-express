Hairy Biker Dave Myers revealed gruelling chemo left him unable to walk or ride his trademark motorcycle. The TV cook was diagnosed with cancer last May and still has treatment. But the debilitating therapy has left him with nerve damage and affected his mobility and balance. Speaking for the first time about his cancer, Dave, 65, revealed the diagnosis was “like a bolt from the blue” as he had no symptoms. He said: “I was driving down to France. I’d had the scan that morning and had a phone call on the motorway in France at half past eight at night and they told me I’d got cancer.” But despite the shock, the treatment has been toughest to deal with. Dave added: “Chemotherapy doesn’t half age you quickly, because your balance goes, so for someone with a motorbike that’s a disaster and my walking’s been affected quite a lot.” Speaking to Kaye Adams on her How To Be 60 podcast, the cook said despite his treatment, he is looking forward to filming a new Hairy Bikers series in May with pal and co-host Si King, 56. “We’re going to film around the chemo. I’m feeling ok and I’m going back to work, which is important to me because I have this relationship with Si going back 30 years. We’re like brothers.” He’s also about to take delivery of a new motorbike, though he needs physiotherapy to help him ride it. Dave said: “They sit me on a Pilates ball and rock me from side to side, pretending I’m on the motorbike. I’m changing gear and braking and making motorbike noises.”
