There is a little over a week to go until round two in Saudi Arabia with Red Bull’s rivals playing catch up after a dominating performance for the reigning champions. Away from the track, Michael Schumacher's friend has opened up on life without the German F1 icon.  ‘Mamma Rosella’, who owns a restaurant located near Ferrari headquarters in Maranello claimed she “misses” the seven-time champion. Rosella adds that she thinks about Schumacher “a lot” who used to visit the restaurant regularly when he drove for the Scuderia. Mercedes boss Toto Wolff was also brutally mocked by Sky Sports F1 host Ted Kravitz. The pit lane pundit hilariously asked a cockroach to help the Austrian chief after the Silver Arrows struggles in Sakhir. Lewis Hamilton and George Russell finished outside the podium places and appear to be the fourth-fastest team in a step backwards on 2022.
