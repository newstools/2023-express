Nintendo and The Pokemon Company recently announced plans to release Scarlet and Violet DLC on Nintendo Switch. Launching in two parts beginning this autumn, the Hidden Treasure of Area Zero will take players "beyond the Paldea region" with new areas, characters and story missions. Arguably the biggest news, however, is that developer Game Freak will use the expansion to bring more than 230 classic Pokemon to Scarlet and Violet. And judging by a new leak, more than 220 of the returning Pokemon have been identified ahead of launch. Following the release of update 1.2.0 for Scarlet and Violet, Pokemon fan @mattyoukhana_ (via VGC) has made an interesting discovery. According to a Twitter post by @mattyoukhana_, Game Freak has deleted hidden Pokedex entries for 223 Pokemon. This includes some of the returning Pokemon that have already been confirmed, such as Yanma. Game Freak did something similar when bringing back a selection of classic Pokemon in Sword and Shield. If the leak is accurate, other returning Pokemon include Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle and Snorlax, as well as Torchic, Duskull and Mudkip.
