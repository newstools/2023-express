Love Island host Maya Jama, 28, looked every inch the Spanish Senorita as she strode towards the villa on Wednesday in a bright orange ruffle dress complete with a rose on one shoulder. The party was in full swing, and Maya was about to become a most unwelcome guest. She announced to the shell-shocked contestants that the public had been voting for the least compatible couple - and that the results would soon come in. "The couples with the fewest votes risk being dumped from the Island tonight," she warned as the Love Islanders around her gulped. The cleavage-baring dress that Maya wore to the villa was as dramatic as the atmosphere among the contestants, and drew admiration from avid viewers.
