A Metropolitan Police officer has been jailed after assaulting a woman. PC Thomas Andrews launched an attack on a woman whilst he was off duty, pushing her to the ground in London in July last year. The woman suffered grazing and Andrews was arrested at the scene, telling officers he was a police officer. Andrews admitted causing actual bodily harm and was sentenced to one year and four months in prison. The incident occurred in the early hours of July 9 last year in South East London when members of the public highlighted the incident to patrolling officers. Andrews pleaded guilty at Woolwich Crown Court in January and was sentenced at the same court on Monday. He also received a restraining order. In a statement the force confirmed he would also face a misconduct hearing "as soon as possible".  Andrews, who was attached to the Central South Command Unit, was suspended from duty after the incident was reported and the force's Directorate of Professional Standards was informed. Detective Chief Superintendent Seb Adjei-Addoh, who leads the Central South Command Unit, said: “I am saddened by this incident and grateful to members of the public who raised the alarm, resulting in PC Andrews’ prompt arrest.“Under the leadership of Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley, everyone in the Met is clear that we must root out those who corrupt the integrity of our organisation. This will take time, but we are absolutely committed to achieving high standards.”
