Some 35 million overseas visitors are expected to touch down, in a near return to pre-Covid levels. The forecast comes days after the Prime Minister sealed a historic deal with the EU, signalling Britain’s return to the top table of economic powerhouses. Tourists from the USA, Canada, the Gulf, France, Germany and Spain top the list of international travellers heading here for set-piece events including the Coronation, Eurovision, Wimbledon and the summer festival season. They are expected to spend four percent more than the all-time spending high of £28.4billion from 2019. Projected inbound visits to the UK are anticipated to be 86 percent of 2019 levels. UK tourism’s trade body, Visit Britain, has launched a “Spilling the Tea on Great Britain” campaign to draw global visitors as the country opens its doors to the world. Visit Britain chief Patricia Yates said: “Our priority is to build on the recovery we have seen, tapping into motivations for travel now to drive bookings. “All eyes are on Britain this year and by telling the story of our dynamic destinations and diverse culture, along with a warm British welcome, we’re inspiring visitors to discover more, stay longer and explore year-round.” The optimistic outlook comes days after Rishi Sunak sealed a historic deal with the EU on major changes to the Northern Ireland Protocol, cutting checks on goods from GB to Northern Ireland. Experts say the Windsor Framework deal will fast-track prosperity for millions. Both London and Brussels now believe Brexit can be a roaring success, following the agreement. Spending by cash-rich Americans is set to be up 40 percent on 2019.
