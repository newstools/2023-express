 Mary Poppins star Dame Julie, 87, stunned onlookers as she looked decades younger at Carol Burnett’s 90th birthday celebration. The two actresses walked side by side on the red carpet in Los Angeles on Thursday to attend a special show taping in honour of Carol’s extraordinary milestone. Carol is actually still 89, but the show will be aired on her actual 90th birthday on April 26. The stars have been close friends for over six decades after having first met on Broadway at the very start of both of their careers. Evidently, the pair got along very well as in 1962, they starred in their first comedy special, Julie And Carol At Carnegie Hall, which won an Emmy the very next year. Julie and Carol cosied up to each other on the red carpet, showing that their chemistry hasn’t faded and, seemingly, neither of them have aged.
