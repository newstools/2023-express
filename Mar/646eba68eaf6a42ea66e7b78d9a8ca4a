The Northern Line has been part suspended after a fire alert at a tube station in North London. Fire engines have been spotted outside Archway Station with a witness saying there is a "fire incident on the track". The latest update to the Northern Line states there is no service between Camden Town and High Barnet with "severe delays" on the rest of the line. One witness said they waited 25 minutes before a train was cancelled because of "a smell of smoke". A witness reported smoke coming from underneath a Northern Line train heading towards Bank station this morning before all passengers were evacuated by Transport for London. Another photo showed Archway station closed as commuters waited outside. A sign outside the station said: "Part suspended between Camden Town and High Barnett due to a dire alert at Archway Station. "Please take local bus 134 to Camden Town". Shortly after 10am Transport for London confirmed Archway station had reopened. TfL said they were called with reports of a fire alert at the station at around 8.35am but the station is "back to running normally". The Jubilee line, Central line and trams are also experiencing minor delays on Wednesday morning.
