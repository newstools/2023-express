A boy of 13 who has raised more than £700,000 by sleeping in a tent is ending his gruelling three-year challenge with a camping festival. Max Woosey, known as “The Boy in the Tent”, started bedding down in his garden in March 2020, aged 10 – in memory of Max’s friend and neighbour, Rick Abbot, who died in February 2019. Rick, who was 74, had given the lad a tent and told him to have an adventure with it, so he decided to camp out in his garden to fundraise for the hospice where Rick died. It had faced a £1million drop in funding because of the lockdown but Max has raised enough to fund 15 full-time nurses. And Max, who has been awarded a British Empire Medal, plans to end his epic feat with a camp-out festival on April 1 in his native North Devon. He tweeted: “It’s a funny feeling that after nearly three years tomorrow marks the start of my last month under canvas. Mixed emotions. Every good thing must come to an end.” Max, from Braunton, added: “It was amazing so many people got in touch wanting to mark my three-year anniversary of camping out. There’s going to be live music, fireworks and food, special guests and axe-throwing. It’s going to be epic.” Max’s mum Rachel said: “We are so proud. He is such a lovely young man and has stayed very grounded about everything he has been through.” Stephen Roberts, of North Devon Hospice, said: “Max has funded 15 nurses for a whole year. Those nurses will have supported in excess of 500 patients.”
