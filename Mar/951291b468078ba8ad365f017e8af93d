Nicola Payne was 18 when she went missing near her parent’s home in Coventry on December 14, 1991. Leaving behind a seven-month-old son, she has never been found as a huge police operation failed to find her. Police believe Nicola was abducted and murdered with two men suspected of her murder cleared following a trial in 2015. Since her disappearance, her family have remained determined to find out what happened to her; Marilyn Payne had been at the forefront of that effort alongside her husband John. Marilyn’s death was confirmed in a Facebook post by the family. They wrote: “Nicola’s family are devastated to announce the death of her mum, Marilyn Payne. A tenacious woman who never gave up on finding her daughter and laying her to rest. “The bravery she showed was extraordinary, and now her determination will continue through her family and many friends in order to finally bring Nicola home.” A £100,000 reward for information which could lead to the recovery of Nicola remains on offer, this was raised from £30,000 in 2018. The search for Nicola will now be led by her remaining family members, her brothers Scott, 55, and Nigel, 57, as well as her cousin, Amanda Eales, 42. Anyone with information on Nicola’s disappearance is urged to contact West Midlands Police on 101.
