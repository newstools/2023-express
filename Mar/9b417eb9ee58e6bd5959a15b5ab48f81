A woman who was left paralysed after having a bad reaction to a neck adjustment is finally home after eight months in hospital. Caitlin Jensen, 29, had a bad reaction to the procedure carried out by her chiropractor. The blood to her brain was cut off as a result. Caitlin, from Georgia, the US, almost cancelled the appointment before suffering from a stroke that left her unable to talk, walk, eat and even breathe without assistance. Her mum, Darlene Jensen, said her daughter was struggling with paralysis at the time. She had to sleep in Caitlin's room on a pull-out bed to make sure she didn't choke in her sleep. Almost a year after Caitlin's life was turned upside down, the recent university graduate has now been able to return home.

Your generosity of spirit and love is a soothing balm on our raw, broken hearts. "Your continuous prayers. The cards and letters that you write. The gifts you all purchased. "The labour and skills that you donated. The materials. The time. The willing hearts. All of it. Thank you." According to reports, the chiropractor who treated Caitlin has declined to comment on the situation.
