The Asian zodiac, sometimes known as Chinese zodiac, is represented by 12 animals, all with different qualities and traits. What does each sign have in store this year? Expert astrologer Jessica Adams exclusively gave her predictions to Express.co.uk. According to Jessica, this year is all about the money - and it's good news. She told Express.co.uk: "Lunar New Year began on Sunday, January 22, 2023, and runs until Saturday, February 10, 2024. "This time round it’s Year of the Rabbit. Rabbits are associated with trade and business in Asian astrology." She told us to keep our eyes peeled for one key date: "May 2023 brings good news on the New Moon of the 19th which will make us all richer. We don’t know why yet. "There may be money laundering arrests and asset seizures which put money back into the system. Perhaps one social media website will offer us free digital coins in our account." Expect a 12 month long "boom". But what can each individual sign expect from the Year of the Rabbit?

Jessica predicted: "New friends in 2023-2024 have noticeably different accents – and may even be bilingual. "Rat, their background will be so dramatically different to your own, that you’ll feel as if you’re on a major learning curve about life, every time you get together this year." Ox (1949, 1961, 1973, 1985, 1997, 2009, 2021) Jessica predicted that Ox might see negative results when it comes to money, home or land. She warned: "A thoughtless financial or property revolution will cost you in 2023. "Nevertheless if you genuinely feel the time has come for change, you may well decide to push a financial, business or property issue further, Ox." Tiger (1950, 1962, 1974, 1986, 1998, 2010, 2022) Tiger needs to focus this year on knowing what to share and what to keep to themselves. "A rather confidential matter keeps making you feel stuck or marooned. Some issues cannot be shared, and some subjects are only fit for your diary. Yet there are some secrets you must trust others with now." Don't miss...

"Expect an unfathomable phase in an old partnership, or a new association, where others do not understand, Rabbit," Jessica predicted. "Now, the marriages, affairs, sexual partnerships and common-law marriages which turn up mean nobody should judge too much, least of all you." Dragon (1952, 1964, 1976, 1988, 2000, 2012, 2024) Dragon should step out of their comfort zone this year and reap huge rewards. It is a "crucial career year" whether you are retired, unemployed, housebound or just have full-time home responsibilities - "this is a brilliant chance to go higher". Snake (1953, 1965, 1977, 1989, 2001, 2013, 2025) Snake might be hit with some unwelcome changes but may have to run with them, according to the astrologer. Jessica explained: "The old family situation no longer works for you in 2023-2024, Snake. "Alternatively, the family change may be forced on you, by circumstances beyond your control. "It’s actually not possible to hang onto the old set-up at this time, because what appeared to be a fixed state of affairs in your life is affected by other people."

Jessica claimed: "Horse, further progress and experimentation with relationships are possible – if you are willing to try. If you are single, you also need to bear this in mind. "So, if you wonder why either of you need to go through an episode again and again – there’s a point to it." Goat (1955, 1967, 1979, 1991, 2003, 2015, 2027) Jessica predicted that Goat will make a life-altering discovery in the upcoming year. She said: "2023-2024 is about a duet or duel in your life, Goat. Can you change the other person? No. Can you change the set-up? No, again. "This will change your attitude towards this two-way street, in a way that improves your entire life." Monkey (1956, 1968, 1980, 1992, 2004, 2016, 2028) Time might feel a little distorted and stagnant for Monkey this year, but as long as they look inwardly they should be okay. Jessica predicted: "Groups of all kinds will be the focus for a time-warp effect now. "Your involvement with a band, club, team, association, charity, cause or Twitter means saying and doing the same things, all the time. "All you can do is change on the inside, just to deal with the repetition, but that works well for you." Rooster (1957, 1969, 1981, 1993, 2005, 2017, 2029) Rooster, do not attempt to halt the hands of time or trick fate, Jessica urged. The astrologer claimed: "There are no accidents in Asian astrology, or in life. If fate seems to be pulling you inexorably towards some kind of settlement or closure with others – take it seriously. It adds up. "Karma is at work in 2023, so you owe, or are owed, from the last cycle, around 12 years ago." Dog (1958, 1970, 1982, 1994, 2006, 2018, 2030) Dog might feel conflicted between reaching financial success and staying true to themselves this year. "The Rabbit cycle in 2023-2024 is about cash, possessions, business and property – but it’s also about your value system, so what you will happily sell out for, and what you will point-blank refuse to compromise on. "It’s about your own personal stock exchange, and what makes you feel richer." Pig (1959, 1971, 1983, 1995, 2007, 2019, 2031) Things are looking up for Pig in 2023 and 2024 and they will be able to enjoy going out into the world on their own. Jessica explained: "2023-2024 is about independence for you. Surf with the waves and stay ahead. "New ideas, new inventions and advances in technology are very likely to change the picture for you at this time and help with the independence you need."
