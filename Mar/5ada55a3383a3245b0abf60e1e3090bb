Amanda Holden, 52, pulled out all the stops to recreate Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz's iconic look. The Britain's Got Talent judge sported a blue and white mini dress, while her blonde tresses were tied up with blue ribbons in pigtails. She carried a basket while finishing off her outfit with the final red touches on her heels and nails.
