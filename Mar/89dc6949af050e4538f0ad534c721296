1000lb Sisters star Tammy is reportedly growing increasingly "frustrated" with sister Amy after she moved into her two-bedroom home, along with her young sons Gage and Glenn, following the alleged breakdown of her marriage. She is thought to be annoyed at "raising the kids" herself. Tammy is said to feel like Amy is "overstaying her welcome" despite reportedly being "happy to help" her sibling during this tough period. The TLC siblings are said to have moved in together when Amy left her family home after "splitting" from Michael after four years of marriage. Sources claim Tammy is "feeling frustrated" with Amy, her two-year-old son Gage and her eight-month-old baby Glenn. She should be enjoying life with her new husband Caleb Willingham, but since stepped in to offer Amy a place to crash after the reported breakup.
