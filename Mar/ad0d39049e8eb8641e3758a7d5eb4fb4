The Oscars 2023 aired on Sunday, March 12, 2023 and marked the 95th Academy Awards. And the line-up was full of massive blockbusters fighting for the gongs. Elvis Presley star Austin Butler may have missed out on the Best Actor award, but it went to a great actor in Brendan Fraser for his performance in The Whale. Best Picture had a collection of amazing nominees, including All Quiet on the Western Front and the high-octane Tom Cruise thriller, Top Gun: Maverick. Meanwhile, Everything Everywhere All At Once won big at the Golden Globes earlier this year - and it did so at the Oscars, at well. There were a number of major Hollywood stars presenting awards throughout the night, as well. Jessica Chastain, Ariana DeBose, Troy Kotsur, Harrison Ford, Nicole Kidman, Samuel L Jackson, Dwayne Johnson, Zoe Salda√±a are presenting a number of awards, as well as Sigourney Weaver, John Travolta, Emily Blunt, Glenn Close, Jennifer Connelly and Florence Pugh. On top of the star-studded line-up of hosts, Rihanna performed her Best Original Song nomination Lift Me Up, which was taken from the Black Panther: Wakanda Forever soundtrack.
