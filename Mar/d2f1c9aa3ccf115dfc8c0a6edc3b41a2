Households could be nearly £300 worse off from next month – despite falls in the energy price cap. Experts claim the average annual power bill is to soar by £285 from April. Families will be forking out £1,100 more than before the spike in gas prices caused by surging post-Covid demand and then Russia blocking supplies to the West. The Government ends its £400 subsidy on bills but is set to keep the Energy Price Guarantee at £2,500 for a further three months in Chancellor Jeremy Hunt’s Budget on Wednesday. The Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit said those in rented homes lacking insulation will be paying £1,250 more compared with before the gas crisis. The ECIU’s Dr Simon Cran-McGreehin said those renting privately live “in poorer quality homes with their hands tied, unable to improve their efficiency”.  He added: “Meanwhile, net-zero homes that were able to invest in solar and insulation are not only saving themselves money but the taxpayer too. “With the Government having failed to confirm better energy standards for privately rented homes, more households will enter next winter locked into higher bills yet again.” Those with good insulation, a heat pump and solar panels, will pay just 60 percent or £925 less than the UK average. Wholesale gas prices have fallen in recent months but are twice pre-crisis levels. Shell has said its ex-chief executive Ben van Beurden got a bonus of £2.6million in 2022, up from £2.2million. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said: “It is outrageous that oil and gas bosses are raking in millions in bonuses while families struggle to heat their homes. “The money being made out of Putin’s illegal war should be helping struggling families not oil barons.”
