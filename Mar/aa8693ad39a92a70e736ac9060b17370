The Toronto Raptors issued an apology on Thursday for a video that was intended to mark the beginning of Women’s History Month. The clip - which featured players Malachi Flynn, Precious Achiuwa and Scottie Barners - caught heat from fans who took issue with the cringeworthy and offensive message. The video was posted on March 1 to mark the beginning of Women's History Month, and players were given a fairly simple task - answer why they thought Beyonce's claim that "Girls run the world" is true. The responses, cut down into a 13-second video posted on the team's official social media accounts, were heavily criticised online for being tone-deaf and cringe-worthy. The clip begins with a note that reads: “Beyoncé said girls run the world. Why do you think that’s true?” Before Flynn states: “They the only one that can procreate.” MUST READ Anthony Davis' telling comments about LeBron James' absence indicate Lakers' mentality Achiuwa then goes on to add: “Girls run the world because they birth everybody.” Ahead of last year’s Rookie of the Year Barnes concluding: “All women are great because they’re all queens.” Shortly after the video went live, the backlash was so severe the franchise decided to pull it almost immediately. Later, the team issued a statement apologising and admitting they made a mistake. According to the Toronto Sun, a statement from the franchise read: “We’re an organisation that prides itself on doing the right thing when it comes to inclusion and representation, and we made a mistake.  “Our sincerest apologies to our players, our staff and our fans—we’ll work to do better today and every day after.” The Raptors will reportedly host a women's empowerment night on March 14 at Scotiabank Arena in Toronto when they face the Denver Nuggets.
