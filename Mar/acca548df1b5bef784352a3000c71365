Boris Johnson's son was seen sporting an adorable costume on World Book Day as thousands of children across the UK dress up as their favourite book character. In an adorable picture, Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas Johnson, two, could be seen dressed up as a dinosaur whilst holding The Dinosaur That Pooped Easter children's book. World book day is celebrated by 100 countries worldwide and was designated by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco) as a special day to celebrate reading. World Book Day was created by Unesco on 23 April 1995. The first World Book Day in the UK and Ireland took place in 1997. The UK celebrates the day in March partly because the April date clashes with the Easter holidays. Some schools will be celebrating the day on alternative days this week due to teacher's strikes.  World Book Day was created to celebrate books and reading. In the UK the focus is on encouraging children and young people to read for pleasure. The aim is for children to be able to get together and share a love of reading. This year the theme is 'Your' World Book Day. The World Book Day charity wants to reach more children from lower-income backgrounds and harder to reach communities.
