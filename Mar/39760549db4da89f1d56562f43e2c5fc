The liver is an essential organ that performs many complex functions that are crucial for maintaining overall health. In addition to the detoxification of the blood, the liver plays a role in metabolism. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) occurs when there is a build-up of fat in the liver, which can lead to organ scarring and reduced function. In the earliest stages, known as steatosis, the fat is considered "harmless" by the NHS. Yet, when the liver becomes inflamed, the condition is regarded as "more serious". If the inflammation persists, scar tissue can develop around the liver and nearby blood vessels. After years of inflammation, the scarred and lumpy liver shrinks in size and NAFLD can lead to liver failure and liver cancer.

And while drinking coffee can be helpful to those "who already have some degree of liver damage", it's only one protective measure. Good liver health still hinges on "reducing the amount of alcohol we drink, eating a good diet, drinking plenty of water, doing regular exercise and keeping to a healthy weight". A 2017 report, hosted by the Institute for Scientific Information on coffee in association with the British Liver Trust, elaborated on research in the area. Dr La Vecchia summarised the research, concluding that regular moderate coffee consumption is associated with a reduced risk of liver disease. Moderate coffee consumption is typically defined as three to five cups per day, based on the European Food Safety Authority’s review of caffeine safety. Coffee consumption has been inversely associated with the activity of the liver enzyme gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT). Yet, its benefits are purported to be due to its caffeine and antioxidant components.
