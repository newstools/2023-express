The Tony award-winning Broadway show opened in 2021 and is now set to open across the pond here in London’s West End. The jukebox musical follows the story of Michael Jackson across over 25 of his biggest hits, as the audience is taken behind-the-scenes in his preparations for the 1992 Dangerous World Tour. MJ the Musical, which will be directed and choreographed by Royal Ballet Associate Artist Christopher Wheeldon OBE, is set to open on March 6, 2024 at the Prince Edward Theatre. Tickets go on-sale in the UK on Wednesday May 24, 2023 with a fan pre-sale available to sign-up for here. The show will be holding open auditions across the UK in the search for “exceptional male singers (high tenors with falsetto) who are also strong actors and dancers to portray and cover the lead role.” According to Voice-Online.co.uk, those auditioning will need to prepare a Michael Jackson song or pop song that shows off your voice and range.
