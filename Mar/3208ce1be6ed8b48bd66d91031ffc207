James Harden played a starring role as he led the Philadelphia 76ers to a stunning win over the Milwaukee Bucks and snapped their 16-game winning streak in the process. The 76ers overturned an 18-point deficit to secure an enormous 133-130 win on Saturday night. Despite two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo coming to town and scoring 34 points, Harden led the way as he scored 38 points along with nine rebounds and 10 assists. It was a stellar performance from the 10-time All-Star, who won MVP himself back in 2018. Harden didn’t have to do it all himself, as MVP candidate Joel Embiid added 31 points and 10 assists. In fact, Harden and Embiid became the first 76ers duo to record over 30 points and at least 10 assists each in the same game since Wilt Chamberlain and Hal Greer in 1965. Tyrese Maxey also contributed with 26 points as 76ers outscored the Bucks 48-31 in the fourth quarter to storm back and ultimately secure the crucial regular season win. It means Milwaukee’s winning run came to an abrupt end after the franchise had embarked on the longest winning in the NBA since the Phoenix Suns claimed 18 successive victories earlier in the campaign.

Antetokounmpo - who is in the mix to win his third MVP award - converted two free throws with under two minutes remaining to make it 125-121 in favour of his side before Harden and Embiid connected on successive three-point strikes. Philadelphia then had its first lead since the second quarter, and Maxey made two free throws to extend their advantage to four points with 25 seconds left. The 76ers ultimately held on to move to 41-22 on the season, while the Eastern Conference-leading Bucks slipped to 45-18 - just half a game ahead of the Boston Celtics. For the Bucks, Brook Lopez scored 26 points while Jrue Holiday added 26 points and 13 assists. Grayson Allen made six 3-pointers and finished with 20 points, which all came in the third quarter.

Tucker, the 76ers still managed to pull off the comeback. Harris left the game and sat out for the entire second half due to calf soreness, while Tucker sat out the fourth quarter with back spasms. Harris scored three points in 13 minutes, while Tucker had two points in 19 minutes as Philadelphia snagged the win. The 76ers will face the Indiana Pacers in their next contest on Monday night. The 28-36 Pacers sit 12th in the Eastern Conference and lost their last match against the San Antonio Spurs, although they take on the Chicago Bulls on Sunday.
