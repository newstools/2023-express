The excitement and tension is ramping up a gear as we get ready for qualifying ahead of the first Grand Prix of the new season in Bahrain. Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso set the pace in Friday's practice, just ahead of Red Bull duo Max Verstappen and Sergio Perez. And it will be the Dutchman Verstappen who starts the year as the hot favourite to win his third world title in a row, with the 25-year-old appearing to be quietly confident ahead of the new campaign. Meanwhile, there is still plenty of speculation around the future of Lewis Hamilton at Mercedes, with the Brit still yet to sign a new contract. The latest reports are suggesting he could make a sensational switch to Ferrari, and it will be intriguing to see what his body language is like when he takes to the track this weekend. There should certainly be no shortage of talking points from the action in the next few days, and Express Sport will be on hand to keep you across all the latest from the Middle East.
