Spencer Matthews’ documentary film follows the Made In Chelsea star on a journey up Mount Everest with Bear Grylls in an attempt to recover his late brother’s body. Michael Matthews died climbing down from the summit in 1999 at the age of just 22 after becoming the youngest Briton to reach the top. Finding Michael was heavily advertised to start streaming on Disney+ yesterday, Friday March 3. However, fans couldn’t find the movie anywhere on the streaming service except for a trailer that popped up hours into the day. Express.co.uk contacted customer service who said the movie was slightly delayed and was set to debut soon after 4am on Saturday March 4. Yet this didn’t happen either. Last night Spencer, 34, updated on his Instagram Story: “Apologies to everyone trying to view Finding Michael on Disney+. The debut date has shifted and we'll update you as soon as we have the timings. This will be in the near future. Thank you for all of your support.” Meanwhile, Disney+ UK tweeted this morning: “We’re sorry that the debut date for Finding Michael has shifted on Disney+. We will let you know as soon as we have new timings for its launch. This will be in the near future. Thanks for your patience.” No reason for the delay or when Finding Michael will now premiere on the streaming service has been announced, leaving some fans furious. One tweeted: “Was that really so hard, Disney? To acknowledge your customers and provide them with an update!?” Another commented: “What about people who paid for Disney plus just to watch this can they get there money back!” And one wrote: “An acknowledgement the day AFTER it was supposed to drop, and after all the countdown promo. And Spencer Matthews doing the promo for it this week. Poor show Disney+. Very poor.” Finding Michael will begin streaming on Disney+ “in the near future”.
