Wrexham stopper Mark Howard revealed how he was forced to apologise to Ryan Reynolds after mistaking the Hollywood star for a dressing room prankster. The 36-year-old joined the Welsh club from Carlisle United in the summer and was taken aback by the welcome call he received from the Deadpool star. “The first time that Ryan phoned me I was driving home.” Howard said on the Pitch Side Youtube channel. “And a foreign number came up on the car and I didn’t want to answer it but you know when you’re thinking ‘I’ve only just signed - you don’t know who it could be.’ “So I’ve answered the call and thought this is definitely banter. Ryan was on the phone saying ‘Hi Mark welcome to Wrexham, buzzing you’ve joined the club.’ “And I said ‘nah, not having it. Who is this?’”In Howard’s retelling Reynolds persisted in his efforts at authentication saying: “It’s definitely me Mark, I just wanted to say thanks for joining the club and that we’re really excited to have you here." But again, Howard doubted. “You need to be able to prove it somehow,” he replied. Only a matter of minutes later and the Arsenal youth product had been followed on social media by one of the most famous faces on the planet. That was enough to verify his identity. “Hi Ryan, I’m so sorry,” Howard recalled. “I went all fangirl on him.” Howard was joined by teammates Ollie Palmer and Elliot Lee in their recent chat with hosts Theo and Reev. The trio were understandably in full spirits as their side sit pretty at the top of the National League standings, a point clear of Notts County and with a game in hand. Lee’s fourth minute goal in Wrexham’s last league game got them off to the perfect start in a 2-1 victory over Chesterfield. The 28-year-old also noted the hands-on approach of Reynolds and Rob McElhenney since he joined the club last summer. “Ryan will mainly text after the games,” the attacking midfielder added. “He’ll speak to you and stuff like. They’re class to be fair.”
