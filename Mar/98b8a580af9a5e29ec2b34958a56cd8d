This month’s two £1million jackpot winners in NS&I's monthly Premium Bonds prize draw are from Nottinghamshire and from Oxfordshire. There are always two £1million top prizes in the Premium Bonds prize draw along with other top prizes of £100,000 and £50,000. The first £1million winner in the March prize draw is from Nottinghamshire and holds the winning Bond 417YB876187, which is worth £15,000. They have £50,000 in Bonds in total. The second winning Bond for the jackpot is 319WC638508 and belongs to a person in Oxfordshire, which is worth £15,000. They hold £30,284 in Bonds in total. Britons can check if they have won a prize using the prize checker tool on the NS&I website or via the app or using an Alexa-enabled device. The prize fund rate has increased to 3.3 percent from the March 2023 draw with £15million in prizes added to the fund. Winners are usually notified if they have won a prize but the message may not get through if a person has changed their contact details or address.

Another winner from Lancashire got £100,000 for a winning Bond worth just £100 wich they bought in August 2001, and they only had £9,150 in total Bonds. One individual from West Sussex won £50,000 for a winning Bond worth just £25, which they purchased in May 2021. Financial journalist Martin Lewis previously explained a person with “typical luck” would need at least £1,000 in Premium Bonds to win. But as each £1 Bond has an equal chance of winning in the monthly draw any saver has a chance of bagging a big cash prize.  One winner in the March draw bagged £100,000 on Bonds they purchased as far back as 1988. They were from Cheshire West and Chester and had a winning Bond worth £2,000. In contrast, one lucky person from Outer London won £100,000 for a winning Bond they purchased in January 2023, worth £20,000. A person can also use the prize checker to see if they have any unclaimed winnings from previous draws. Jill Waters, NS&I retail director, said: “Our warmest congratulations go to our two jackpot winners from Nottinghamshire and Oxfordshire, and to all our winners over the years. “Since the first ever Premium Bonds draw in 1957, we’ve now paid out a staggering £25.1billion in prizes. That’s an impressive milestone, and shows why Premium Bonds continue to be so popular with so many people.”   READ MORE: Millions of Britons to get £900 cost of living payment - new details released People with Premium Bonds are entered into a monthly prize draw rather than getting an interest rate on their savings. Customers can choose to have their winnings paid into their bank account or reinvested into more Bonds, increasing their chance of winning again. More than nine in 10 prizes are paid directly into a customer’s bank account or reinvested, an NS&I spokesperson said. When purchasing Bonds, a person has to buy at least £25 in Bonds and can buy up to £50,000 in Bonds. One woman spoke to Express.co.uk after she won four times in six months with a £75 win in the January draw. Daisy Pledge started investing in Premium Bonds in February 2018 while working as a freelancer as she was saving up to buy a house. She said: “At the time, the interest rate was much better to do it in Premium Bonds. Because if you won £25 once for the whole year, I would have made more on my savings than any savings account that you could get.” She said she also likes the flexibility of Premium Bonds, saying: “If you’re in a regular savings account, to get the really high percentages, you have to not touch it for a year or longer. “Whereas Premium Bonds, you can take it out whenever you fancy. Putting funds back in, you do have to wait that extra month for it to be live again, but I wouldn’t have just Premium Bonds.” The first Premium Bonds prize draw took place on June 1, 1957 with a top prize of £1,000 and 23,142 total prizes on offer, compared to 5,007,989 today. The savings scheme has paid out some £25.1billion in prizes to lucky winners since the first draw took place.
