Sharon Stone, 65, "panicked" some fans after sharing images of herself celebrating her birthday with a pair of dramatically resized lips. "I did it. Finally. For my birthday I went Hollywood!" she quipped to her 3.6 million followers, who joked back: "Looks completely natural!" However, one admitted he was "panicked for a second" before spotting a packet of wax gummies in her hand, which she seemed to have used to create the illusion of a temporarily inflated pout. Sharon's exaggerated new look comes after she swore off real-life cosmetic surgery 13 years ago, following a bad experience with lip filler injections. The Basic Instinct star previously admitted to experimenting with plumping up her pout to cheer herself up after her 2004 divorce from journalist Phil Bronstein. Those days now firmly behind her, Sharon showed off her playful new visage as she reclined on the sofa in a pair of silky polka dot pyjamas.
