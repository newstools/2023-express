Brenda Edwards told the panel she thinks if Harry were to go to the coronation it would be a good way for them to bury the hatchet.She commented: “I think it’s best for them both to go, rather than just Harry and Meghan not go.“That will create even more arguments, conversations and speculation so I think it will be good for them to go."Loose Women continues weekdays on ITVX and ITV1 from 12:30pm
