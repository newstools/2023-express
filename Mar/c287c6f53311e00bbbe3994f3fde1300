We're coming towards the end of a big week of European football action as Chelsea made it through to the Champions League quarter-finals but Tottenham fell short. Tonight it's the turn of Manchester United and Arsenal in the Europa League, while West Ham boss David Moyes is desperately searching for a source of joy in the Europa Conference League. Games are becoming more pressurised at this stage of the campaign and Graham Potter's Chelsea handled the weight of expectation against Borussia Dortmund, overturning a first-leg deficit and a torrid run of form to power through. Tottenham weren't so lucky, stuttering to a goalless draw with AC Milan on home turf to crash out and heap more pressure on Antonio Conte. United face Real Betis this evening with hopes of putting the weekend's 7-0 Liverpool thrashing behind them. Arsenal's trip to Sporting Lisbon and West Ham's journey to face AEK Larnaca are also well worth following in the hours to come.
