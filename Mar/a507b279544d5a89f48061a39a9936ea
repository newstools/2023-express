Rozalla, 58, proved that she hasn't aged a day as she returned to the stage to perform her hits, including 1992's Everybody's Free (To Feel Good). The Zimbabwean hitmaker performed ahead of the Betfred Super League match in Wigan over the weekend. She wore a red and white rugby shirt, paired with black skinny jeans and a belt as she entertained the crowd with her dance hits. At the height of her career, Rozalla secured four UK Top 40 hits, including Everybody's Free and Faith (In the Power of Love). In 1992, Rozalla also toured with Michael Jackson, opening all of his shows on the European leg of his Dangerous tour.
