English actress Florence Pugh, 27, proved that the snow in London wouldn’t get in the way of her sartorial choices as she graced the red carpet in a very skimpy top for the UK premiere of her Sky Original Film, A Good Person. The blonde beauty went braless as she showed off her abs in the crop top, with only a high neckline to protect her from the cold weather. The top, featuring shimmering embroidered stripes, was tied together with ribbons at the sides, leaving her toned arms bare. Florence paired the statement sleeveless top with a pair of grey checked trousers and accessorised with a deconstructed black coat, which only partially covered her arms and hands. The Don’t Worry Darling star is reuniting with her ex Zach Braff, 47, to promote the indie movie, which he directed. The former Hollywood couple filmed A Good Person before it was revealed in August of last year that they had split after three years of dating.
