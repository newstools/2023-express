Former BBC Breakfast star Dan Walker, 45, looked very dapper in a blue tuxedo as he bravely presented a major television awards show just a week after suffering a crash on his bike.  Dan unveiled his incredible recovery as he arrived to host the Royal Television Society Awards last night.  However, he made sure to credit his makeup artist for “covering up the bruises” as he made his first public appearance since the accident.  Dan’s stint as an awards show host comes days after he was hit by a car while riding his bike in Sheffield.  The Channel 5 News presenter was left with a bloodied face covered in bruises, informing fans about the incident alongside a photo of him in the back of an ambulance.
