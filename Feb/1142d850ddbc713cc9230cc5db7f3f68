A Metropolitan Police officer tied a woman up and told her "who are you going to tell, I'm the police", a court has heard. PC Sam Grigg tied a female housemate up after entering their shared kitchen “without warning or explanation and began to tape wrists together," Kingston Crown Court was told. Grigg continued to tie her ankles together and taped her mouth, applying "more force" to the victim, telling her she would "never be able to set herself free”. Prosecutor Alexander Agbamu told court the victim asked "why are you doing this" with Grigg telling her "he thought it was funny". After Grigg had been tied up, the doorbell rang and Grigg went to the door while the victim attempted to crawl to find a knife to cut herself free. Mr Agbamu told the court Grigg returned telling her "she would never be able to set herself free". He added: "After a while he told her he would take her bindings off if she asked him nicely. “She pleaded with him to set her free.” Griggs used a knife to cut the bindings but cut her in the process, saying "oops". Mr Agbamu told the court he freed the victim but said "in a jokey tone asked her if she forgave him” and the woman said she did not. In a victim impact statement the victim said she suffered from nightmars and flashbacks as a result of the attack. The court heard that the two had lived together for around six months but the victim always thought the defendant was a "nice guy" but a "bit weird".    The court heard that there was a delay in the victims report  reaching Metropolitan Police detectives because the “system understood that she was trying to make a complaint against a police officer rather than reporting a crime” after she made an online report on December 6. Grigg admitted false imprisonment and actual bodily harm charges and will be sentenced later on Friday.
