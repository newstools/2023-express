Police are desperately searching for a young woman who disappeared three days ago. Martha Tracey, 29, was last seen on a residential street in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, on Saturday afternoon. Greater Manchester Police says the force is now "increasingly concerned" about her following her disappearance. Martha's mother, Susan, also appealed for help on Facebook. She wrote: "If anyone has ANY information my family and I are begging that you please come forward… We are praying for her safe return home to us. Thank you to anyone who has shared this." Martha is described as being around 5ft 10ins tall, of medium build and with pale skin, Manchester Evening News reports. She usually wears her hair up in a bun. Anybody with any information is being urged to contact Greater Manchester Police.   Greater Manchester Constabulary's Facebook appeal has been shared by hundreds of residents across the county. One man posted: "Shared Ashton in Makerfield. I pray that she is found safe and well." Another Facebook user posted: "Shared in Stockport. I hope you find your daughter soon Susan Tracey." And one woman, who grew up knowing Martha, wrote online: "I really hope she’s found soon safe and well. I have shared. I used to be friends with Martha when we were younger, it was a shock to see her face. "I have everything crossed for you." Even people away from the region have shared the appeal in the fear Martha has left the area. "I've shared. I am in the Midlands but you never know. I hope she returns safe and well, from one mum to another, sending you love and hope," wrote one mother. Anyone with information about Martha’s whereabouts should contact police on 0161 856 9328.
