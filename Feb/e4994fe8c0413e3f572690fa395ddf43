Andy Murray saved more match points against an Italian as he fought back to beat Lorenzo Sonego at the Qatar ExxonMobil Open.  The Scot survived three match points at 4-5 in the final set and then came back from 0-3 in the tiebreak to win 4-6 6-1 7-6. The double Wimbledon champion, now 35, won seven of the last eight points to win another thriller in two-and-a-half hours. The three-time Major champion also saved a match point against Matteo Berrettini in the first round of his last event at the Australian Open. Double Qatar champion Murray said: “It was really tough. We had never played against each other before or practised with each other so I didn’t know exactly how the match would go and it took a while to get used to his game. He is a very aggressive player and takes a lot of chances, plays high-risk tennis.  He rolled the dice at the end and it looked like he had the momentum and thankfully in the mid part of that tiebreak, he made a couple of mistakes and I managed to turn it around.” The world No.70 will now face fellow Olympic champion Alex Zverev in the next round. The Scot and the German have a frosty relationship since Murray called for the ATP to investigate allegations of domestic violence against players after Zverev was accused of abuse by his ex-girlfriend. Qualifier Liam Broady also won his final set tiebreak to beat Oleksii Krutykh of Ukraine 6-0 4-6 7-6.
