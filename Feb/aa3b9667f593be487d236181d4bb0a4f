Shutting the door on nurses is the same as shutting the door on patients. We all deserve better than this. He must remember: patients aren’t dying because nurses are striking; nurses are striking because patients are dying.  By ignoring nursing staff and the patients they speak for, they are choosing to let the biggest NHS strikes go ahead next Monday and Tuesday. Thank you to you, the very loyal British public, who are supporting nursing staff. Tens of thousands of you signed a letter to Rishi Sunak and nurses hand-delivered it to Downing Street. While politicians in other parts of the UK have shown a willingness to engage in meaningful negotiations on pay, Mr Sunak has steadfastly refused. He’s not even come to the table. As we said in the letter to him, the NHS is the bedrock of modern Britain – and it’s crumbling. Nursing staff make up more than half of all NHS staff and they are pushed beyond their limits. Care is not safe at present and the public pays the price. The Prime Minister has now done 100 full days behind that big desk.  Patients each month waiting more than 12 hours in A&E – up 10,000. The number of people on waiting lists in England – up to very nearly 7 million. There are record numbers of unfilled nurse jobs around England – 47,000. How does Rishi Sunak expect to hire – and keep - the nurses needed for his NHS plans if they do not feel valued? We are tired of being taken for granted. Prime Minister, negotiate with nurses and Monday’s strike is off.
