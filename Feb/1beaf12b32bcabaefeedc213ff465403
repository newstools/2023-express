A man has been charged with murder after a 74-year-old woman was stabbed to death in a park on Saturday. Lorna England died at the scene after police were called to Ludwell Valley Park in the Wonford area, Exeter shortly after 4pm with reports of an assault. Cameron Davis, 30 of Exeter Road, Exmouth has been charged and remained in police custody before appearing in court on Monday. Police previously said they did not believe the victim and the suspect were known to each other. Devon and Cornwall Police have created a Major Incident Public Reporting (MIPP) page as part of the investigation into this incident as they appeal for members of the public to come forward. Speaking on Sunday Superintendent Dan Evans said the force believed the incident was "isolated" but did not know the motive behind the attack. Mr Evans said: "At this time we do not know the motive for the attack but we do not currently believe that the victim and suspect are known to each other. "I would like to reassure people that this is an isolated incident but there be a heightened police presence in the city over the next few days." Speaking to the press he added: "We are still searching the Wonford area as part of our investigation. We believe we may have located the knife believed to have been used in the attack and are retrieving this as we speak." He reassured the community that this type of incident is "rare" and will be "felt deeply by all" in the area. Police said the suspect was arrested following a police appeal by an off-duty police officer outside the Yorkshire Building Society on Exeter High Street. He said: "Whilst this type of incident is very rare, Wonford is a very close community and I know this death will be felt deeply by all who live in the area. "My thoughts are with the family and loved ones of the victim at this tragic time. We will be supporting them over the coming days and weeks with specially trained officers." Davis is due to appear at Exeter Magistrates’ Court today.
