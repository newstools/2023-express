Pokemon collectors may want to check eBay this weekend, as one of the rarest cards goes on sale. Pokemon fan Tomoya Ohno is listing his 1998 Pikachu Illustrator card on the auction site from 1am GMT on February 25, until the bidding ends on March 6. Bids for the rare Pokemon card will start at a whopping $480k, which works out at around £401k for UK punters. Of course, that's just the starting bid, which means it could end up selling for a lot more. If you want to make a cheeky bid, or simply want to keep track of the final price, you can check out the special Pokemon Day section on eBay. The expensive Pikachu card was awarded to 41 winners of the 1997 and 1998 Pokemon Illustrator contests. In the years since the Pikachu cards were issued, only 24 have been certified by the PSA grading body. Tomoya Ohno's card is a PSA 8 graded card, which means it's in immaculate condition. A 1998 Pikachu Illustrator PSA 7 card was previously sold for around £310k on the auction site in 2021. The Pokemon trading card game began in 1996. Almost 200 sets have been released since its inception. If you strike it lucky you can make a huge profit selling Pokemon cards. A few have sold for millions of pounds. The most expensive Pokemon card sold for $5.275 million in 2021. It was purchased by YouTube star Logan Paul, who is now a WWE wrestler after a stint in boxing. Logan Paul made headlines by wearing the Pokemon Card around his neck during his Wrestlemania entrance.
