A woman was gobsmacked after a fish bought from a fishmonger was alive when she went to cook it. Cindy Lao realised the gills of one of the Crucian carp were still moving - after nearly 48 hours on ice. She bought a batch of fish from a fishmonger, which is believed to have sourced them from the wholesalers on the same morning. But after recognising one was still moving, the woman and her partner ran a bath of water where the carp lived for the next two weeks. Speaking to Gloucestershire Live, Cindy's partner Paul Lewis-Borman said: "She called me down as she had thought she had seen the Crucian carp’s gills moving and asked me what I thought. They certainly were. I was in two minds of whether to put the poor thing out of its misery but Cindy said ‘no, it is a miracle he is still alive’. So we got a bowl of water to put him in.” For a while, the poor Crucian carp seemed to be struggling but he has made a full recovery. Paul said: “The carp was listless for a while, but after 20 minutes those gills were certainly going. We had nowhere to keep him except the bath and luckily we have another shower room. Needless to say, he could not stay there and it did put you off when you were trying to use the toilet.   “Lazarus, as he is now known, needed to be rehoused, if for no other reason than my girlfriend was then paying the fish more attention than she did me. In the picture you can see how quickly things can change, 24 hours before he was going to be dinner.” Paul posted on a forum called Pets4Homes and a lady with a pond with Koi carp in it came forward and said she would happily give Lazarus a good home.  Paul said: “He had been through a lot. He was sandwiched between all those dead fish for all that time and was nearly dinner. Cindy certainly bought fresh fish that day. “We are pleased he now has a good home. The lady told us he now has a best fish friend who he happily is swimming about with in his new home.”
