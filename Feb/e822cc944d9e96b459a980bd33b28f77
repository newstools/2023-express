Arsenal legend Thierry Henry jokingly threatened to walk out of the CBS Sports studio when asked if he would ever have played for Tottenham. The Gunners legend, who is the club's record goalscorer having struck 228 times under Arsene Wenger, still has a strong affiliation to his former club 11 years on from his last appearance. Henry is often at the centre of the Champions League camaraderie on CBS Sports and he took offence when Kate Abdo popped the most insulting of questions. Abdo said: "Could you ever have played for Spurs?" To which Henry replied in disgust: "Please, Spurs? I'm leaving. No, no, no. Joking aside, I wasn't actually joking on that one. "No - I had the opportunity and I declined." READ MORE: Reason Erik ten Hag 'flunked final Tottenham interview' is now laughable at Man Utd Jamie Carragher then said: "Spurs came in for you?" Abdo then added: "For triple the money?" Henry's response was coy: "Exactly for what you said and I said 'no'." Carragher was desperate for answers, responding: "Who came in for you, Manchester United? It's got to be a rival of Arsenal. Henry then concluded: "No, I won't say. You can say whatever you say, I will say no all the way."

There is a statue that sits outside the Emirates Stadium of his iconic knee slide following his sublime solo goal in the 3-0 win over Tottenham in November 2002. Tottenham are also responsible for one of the best moments of Henry's career when Arsenal won the Premier League title at White Hart Lane in 2004.
