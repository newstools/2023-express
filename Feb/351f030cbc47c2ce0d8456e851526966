Search and rescue specialists from the UK have arrived to help Turkish authorities comb through rubble for survivors following Monday and Tuesday's earthquakes. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) announced yesterday that a plane carrying 77 rescue experts, including an emergency team, four search dogs and their equipment from the UK International Search and Rescue arrived on Tuesday evening, and their first full day of work commences today. The Government-backed team is comprised of firefighters and staff from 14 of the country's fire and rescue services, with experts in their ranks hailing from England, Scotland and Wales. They come equipped with highly specialised tools, including seismic listening devices, concrete cutting and breaking equipment and propping and shoring tools used to support fragile structures. Team leader David O’Neill said: "We train for exactly this kind of event, and the team are very experienced at acting quickly to earthquakes of this magnitude and other disasters, to get on the ground and effect lifesaving operations as quickly as possible." Mr O’Neill said the team would stay for up to two weeks and that their self-sufficiency would ensure they don't burden Turkish authorities. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
