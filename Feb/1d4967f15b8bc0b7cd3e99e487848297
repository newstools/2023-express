It came as defence secretary Ben Wallace joined BBC Breakfast to discuss the mysterious fly balloons which have been appearing over the US and are suspected to be spy equipment from China. Detailing the expected response from the UK if the balloons were spotted in the airspace, Ben let slip a swear word and, rather than the standard apology on behalf of the BBC, Nina Warhurst instead used the language to ask the secretary about his "frustration".  As the conversation moved on, Warhurst stated to Wallace: "You're in Brussels with your peers from NATO. "Let's talk about some international concerns, about how robust UK defence is. "We start with comments from a French MP telling The Telegraph that our reserves have been significantly depleted by supporting Ukraine, and that's a concern." She continued: "Also reports in the German media, backed up by the MOD sources in the UK saying that NATO has asked Berlin to remain in charge of the leadership of the rapid reaction force, because we are not capable of taking control."

Visibly irritated, Wallace responded: "Look, I think the first one, the story of Germany is just b*******, right? "I mean, to be honest, the simple reality is NATO leadership did not approach anybody. "It's interesting that story is based on a source from a German website you and I have never heard of." As fans pointed out the rude slip-up, they waited for Warhurt's response, in which they expected her to apologise for the language. However, Warhust later addressed the swear word without issuing an apology to viewers. She later commented: "I sense your frustration, the language you used earlier indicates that perhaps you are frustrated by the widespread reports about our capacity. "But it's coming from within your party as well - Tobias Elwood saying that stockpiles are running low, Admiral Lord West, as you said, failure to bolster capacity means we've been hollowed out in recent years."

Twitter user @snaphappycat asked: "#ninawarhurst no apology? At least on behalf on this govt minister #talkingb******* #benwallace #bbcbreakfast." @Fuzzy_beasley pointed out: "Looks like @BBCBreakfast isn’t going to apologise for Ben Wallace’s language. Well, that’s just b*******. #BBCBreakfast." @Maz40592566 added: "#BBCBreakfast did #BenWallace really just say #B******* without any apology?" @Horwichbloke19 asked the social media platform: "Was he pulled up for saying that later?" "Did Ben Wallace just say b******s? #BBCBreakfast," @rachfatcat asked. @simongalcock posted: "Oops….naughty word alert from Ben Wallace on #bbcbreakfast." @davepaters added: "Ooo Defence Secretary Wallace just said "b*******" on #BBCBreakfast trying to look cool presumably." Shortly before the show ended at around 9am, Warhurst and co-host Ben Thompson again addressed Wallace's language. "You might have heard the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, used a rude word in our interview earlier." Thompson continued: "So, for the sake of transparency, just to be really clear, we checked it on the Ofcom regulator's website. "And on there, they say that the word is, quote, medium language, potentially unacceptable. "But it's less problematic if it's used to mean 'nonsense.'" "And in that case, that was exactly what he meant," Warhurst concluded before directing viewers on how to make complaints to the government. BBC Breakfast airs daily from 6am on BBC One.
