The annual day of love is around the corner, with just a week to go until the 14th of February, and many are starting to plan celebrations.   When searching for physical gifts, it can often be tricky getting it right, so buying an experience is a great way to show your partner you care and a good excuse to put a date in the diary to spend some time together. A poll commissioned by Travelzoo in 2021, found that 42 percent of people would much rather be given a gift which creates memories, rather than a physical item, which is likely to be forgotten after time. Of the 2,000 people asked, over 65 percent also said that the anticipation of an event is almost as exciting as the event itself, showing that this type of gift is a great way to surprise someone and make them feel special.   In a Barclaycard survey, 61% of respondents said they’d cook a special dinner at home for Valentine's Day, and BBCGoodFood said that 'every Valentine’s Day, steak is the overwhelming firm favourite of Good Food users'. Whether eating our or at home, wine and indulgent desserts are usually popular, and many of the restaurant deals offer three-course meals, which is ideal for sampling several dishes at a set price. Booking an experience meal or meal kit can help you stick to a budget for Valentine's Day, as most include everything you need for a lovely meal, plus it takes the stress away from last-minute planning.
