State pension claimants who receive Personal Independence Payment (PIP) are set to receive up to £1,506 a month from April. When someone reaches state pension age, they can no longer make a new claim for PIP. However, if someone is already receiving it, they will continue to receive the benefit until the award period ends, when it will be reviewed in the normal process. The latest statistics from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) show that by the end of October, there were more than three million people across the UK claiming PIP. The figures also show that nearly half a million people of state pension age are also in receipt of PIP. Across Great Britain, some 486,940 older people are getting support through the disability payment, including 52,676 in Scotland.
