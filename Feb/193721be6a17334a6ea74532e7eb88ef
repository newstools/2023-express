 The 62-year-old shared a snap on Wednesday entirely makeup-free as she lay on a sunbed in Florida. Donning just a strappy black bikini as she lay on green and white striped towels, the actress paired her casual look with some sunglasses and a delicate golden necklace. The Dirty Dancing star shared in the caption the unlikely chain of events that led her to the “gentle aquamarine surf”. The actress wrote in the caption: “Sometimes when you go for 24 hrs to a city you’ve never been to, and where you know no one, you might find yourself being taken care of by perfect strangers.” Jennifer singled out her driver Tom who had “arranged for me to get a few solitary hours on the baby powder sand” and Julie from the hotel she was staying at “who escorted me down to the water’s edge where a covered sun bed awaited my arrival”.
