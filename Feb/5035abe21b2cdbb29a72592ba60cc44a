Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has rejected sending fighter jets to help Ukraine defeat the Russian invasion. Speaking to Sky News a year after the invasion started, Mr Wallace said that on the day Russian tanks rolled in he told officials that they needed "to give Ukraine hope". But after Boris Johnson last night renewed his calls for British Typhoons to be sent to Ukraine, Mr Wallace insisted this morning: "We will not be sending British Typhoons to Ukraine for now." He added that the way the conflict has developed "you can never rule anything in, and you can never rule anything out". But he warned that the sophisticated equipment did not just require pilots but a large amount of support staff. He warned that "if you look at the tail" they need around 200 personnel of engineers, electricians and others. "We are obviously not going to send 200 RAF personnel into Ukraine." He later added on Times Radio: "In the timescale of this conflict right now, the ability for us to train pilots on Typhoons and then train them on the fighting of Typhoon because fighting aircraft is a very complicated layered process. "And you also require about 200 people to look after the jets like a Formula One pit crew... the West is not putting in RAF personnel or other Air Force personnel into Ukraine. "So the other quick way that Ukraine can benefit from fighter jets is for those countries in Europe that have Russian or Soviet fighter jets and MIG 29s or SU 24, if they wish to donate, we could use our fighter jets to backfill and provide security for them as a result, or indeed, to backfill to allow them to have their own capability because they are already configured to fight in a Nato way, where of course Ukraine isn't."  Speaking last night, Mr Johnson told Sky News that "2023 must be the year of victory for Ukraine." He warned: "This is a decisive moment for the 21st century. If we allow Putin to win it will send a signal around the world that national borders can be changed by force." But he insisted that meant that the UK needs to "break the ice" and be the first to send fighter jets to Ukraine. He went on: "If they need the kit sooner or later, if that's the choice - sooner or later - then let's give it to them sooner." But he warned: "This is an absolutely critical moment for the world." Earlier this month, President Zelensky visited the UK and then Brussels to make an appeal for fighter jets. The jets are partly needed to provide air cover for the 200 tanks which have already been gifted to Ukraine by Britain and NATO allies. President Zelensky presented Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle with a Ukrainian pilot's helmet as a symbolic gesture. In an address to the joint sitting of the Houses of Parliament in Westminster Hall, he said: "In your country, your King {Charles III] is an airforce pilot, in my country pilots are kings."
