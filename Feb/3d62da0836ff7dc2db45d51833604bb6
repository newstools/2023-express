Drivers have been urged to be careful when opting for E10 petrol as some vehicles might not be compatible with the fuel. Accidentally filling up the car with the wrong fuel type can result in substantial damage and huge repair costs. The RAC estimates that there are around 600,000 older vehicles and classic cars that should not use E10 and instead continue to use E5 petrol. And, with around 150,000 motorists putting the wrong fuel into their cars every year, a motoring expert has issued two serious warnings. Dorry Potter, car and scrappage expert at National Scrap Car, told Express.co.uk: “The biggest benefit of E10 over E5 is that it is better for the environment. “Where E5 is 95 percent unleaded petrol and five percent ethanol, E10 is 90 percent unleaded petrol and 10 percent ethanol.

The first is that not all cars are compatible with it meaning that if someone was to absentmindedly put this fuel in a non-compatible car it is likely to cause damage. “The Government has a tool on their website which helps motorists check whether their car is able to have E10.

Dave Rossall, NFU Mutual’s Motor Claims Manager, echoed Mr Potter’s comments and urged drivers to check their compatibility with E10 before visiting a petrol station.

Putting diesel into a petrol tank is more challenging but not impossible. When arriving at the filling station forecourt, drivers should not rely on the colour of the pump but instead, make sure the correct fuel is used by checking the information on or near the nozzle. Also, motorists could put an alert sticker inside the fuel flap to provide one last opportunity to check that all is well.
