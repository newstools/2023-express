Vladimir Putin has repeatedly cited the eastern expansion of NATO’s border with Russia as one of the reasons for his brutal invasion of Ukraine, but thus far, the war has only served to further increase the line of contact with the alliance.    The comments mark the first time Mr Stoltenberg has directly addressed Ukraine’s hopes of joining NATO, an accessionary move that many believed might not ever happen. He spoke ahead of a parliamentary debate in Finland aimed at accelerating their bid to join NATO, with a vote expected on Wednesday. Both Finland and Sweden ended their decades-long policy of military neutrality last year, in light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, expressing a desire to join the Western defensive alliance, a request that was met with welcome from NATO. While Turkey and Hungary are currently blocking the two Nordic nation’s applications, Mr Stoltenberg has said he expects these issues to be resolved. If Finland successfully joins NATO, the alliance’s border with Russia will effectively double. If Ukraine is allowed to join, that would add a further 1,000 miles of contact with Russia.
