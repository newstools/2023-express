Dance star Paula Abdul has given a powerful insight into her father’s battle with Alzheimer’s, calling it the “most unforgiving disease”. The former American Idol judge wept as she recalled her struggle at watching Harry’s health deteriorate. Grammy winner Paula, 60, spoke ahead of a star-studded gala last night for the Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health, in Cleveland, where staff cared for her dad. She said: “Alzheimer’s is to me the most unforgiving, unfair disease." “It’s so difficult to understand when it’s starting and when you’re getting frustrated." “My sister and I would say, ‘Dad, you just asked us the same question and you’re repeating yourself’, and this is before we knew. When things start progressing, it’s heartbreaking.”  The top choreographer added: “There was one instance where I said, ‘Hey Daddy, you know who I am?’ “He just stared straight ahead and he said, ‘No,’ and then I went, ‘It’s OK’. “He goes, ‘But I know you’re one of mine’. And that was the last sentence that I ever heard by my father. “I’m a daddy’s girl.” Harry died in spring 2019. Straight Up singer Paula presented last night’s Keep Memory Alive Annual Power of Love gala in Las Vegas. Among those performing were rocker Alice Cooper and soul icon Michael McDonald. ● For more information, visit keepmemoryalive.org
