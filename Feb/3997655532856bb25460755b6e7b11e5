Speculation over the next James Bond continues to be rife, especially with it being well over a year since Daniel Craig left the 007 franchise in No Time To Die. Producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson have said the next Bond will be a man and teased he’ll probably be in his thirties, but just who will they pick? One hot contender according to the latest odds from Ladbrokes is Jack Lowden, star of the BBC’s new heist series The Gold, Jessica O'Reilly of Ladbrokes said: "Jack Lowden's portrayal of Kenneth Noye in The Gold has gone down an absolute storm with viewers and they've piled into his odds of becoming the next James Bond." The 32-year-old is certainly the right age to be starting a career as Bond and has seen his odds slashed from 16-1 to 10-1. Speaking recently with Esquire the actor played it coy, saying: “No, I've never auditioned. Like everyone else, I’m still trying to get over the fact that Daniel Craig’s not doing it anymore. I think he should still be doing it, to be honest, and he was my Bond. It’s very flattering to be asked about it, but I’m very much all about River Cartwright at the moment.” Whatever the case, he has some stiff competition in the odds, which should of course be taken with a pinch of salt.

Craig’s runner-up from the Casino Royale auditions isn’t playing Superman or The Witcher anymore, although given he turns 40 this year may mean he's too old to be starting out as 007. Meanwhile, Aaron Taylor-Johnson is right behind him on 3-1 with rumours swirling that he’s auditioned for the Broccolis and really impressed them. Other hot contenders are James Norton on 7/2, Tom Hardy on 9/1 and Regé-Jean Page on 10/1. SOURCE
