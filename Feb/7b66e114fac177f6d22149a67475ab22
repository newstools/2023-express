Experts are warning that there has been an outbreak of food poisoning cases in a Welsh town. Public Health Wales has confirmed that Abergavenny has seen a rise in cases of food poisoning - believed to be caused by the shigella bacteria. Shigella bacteria cause an infection called shigellosis and symptoms can include diarrhoea (which can sometimes include blood), fever, and stomach cramps. The symptoms can begin one to two days after being infected and can last up to seven days. This infection is not life-threatening but can result in hospitalisation in some cases. One person told WalesOnline that their family and friends have been put through "horrendous sickness" as a result of contracting shigella. It is understood to be linked to a restaurant they visited on Friday, February 12. They explained: "My relatives became incredibly sick on the following Sunday and Monday with symptoms persisting through to the mid-week for one and late week for the other. Symptoms included some vomiting, fevers, terrible stomach cramps and blood in their diarrhoea." A Public Health Wales spokesperson said: "Public Health Wales is aware of an increase in cases of gastrointestinal illness in the Abergavenny area, which may be due to shigella infection. "All appropriate public health actions needed are being taken with the required urgency.  "Shigella infection (shigellosis) is an intestinal infection caused by a family of bacteria known as shigella. The main symptom of shigella infection is diarrhoea. It is not life-threatening, although in some cases it may result in hospitalisation, but symptoms usually clear up within four to five days. "Anyone who may be concerned about any symptoms they’re experiencing should contact 111 over the weekend and evenings or contact their GP in-hours service during weekdays." Public Health Wales said it is currently unable to provide the number of confirmed cases.
