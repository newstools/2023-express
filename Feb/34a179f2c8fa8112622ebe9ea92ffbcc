Jamie Lee Curtis looked full of life as she strode in wearing a black velvet blazer paired with a white satin floor-length skirt. The multi-award winning actress, who has also made a name for herself blogging and penning a string of children's fiction books, has already given an insight into how her youthful exterior is mirrored within. When she received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Venice Film Festival back in 2021, she told of how she felt "so alive, like I'm this 14-year-old person just beginning their life. "Thatâ€™s how I wake up every day, with that sort of joy and purpose!" she exclaimed. Meanwhile, stunning Vera Wang walked in dressed almost entirely in white, with her dress dramatically slashed open to reveal a barely there black bralette, showing off her age-defying abs. The ageless fashion designer, who is renowned for her elegant wedding gowns, never ceases to astound followers with her extraordinary looks - and many agreed she could have passed for someone less than half her age.
