A British-based businessman is coming to terms with losing 50 relatives in the earthquake in Turkey. Ali Tekce, 39, has lost 11 members of his immediate family while dozens more of his extended family have also perished. But the parents, brother and sister of the restaurant owner in Beverley, East Yorkshire, are safe in his home southern city of Sanliurfa. Ali called it “an unexplainable situation”. He said: “It’s not like it’s just in one city, but over ten major cities and over 15 million people have been affected. “I am sad of course, but we are all doing the best we can to support them from the UK. “The people who have survived are just trying to save the other people. They have forgotten about their own family member’s bodies in the rubble and they are trying to save others. They are looking in all of the buildings and listening for any noises or sign of life.” Ali told of a man who survived the quake but took his own life after he found out his family had died. He is raising money for supplies for Turkey and said he “cannot believe” how much support the country is receiving.
