  Nadia wasn’t afraid to give fans an eyeful this evening, as she donned a plunging, white camisole over a lacey, red bra. In the parody video, she could be seen seductively mashing some potatoes as she attempted to imitate Nigella. During the hilarious clip, Nadia made reference to the chef’s unusual pronunciation of the word “microwave”. She captioned the post: “Nadiella / Nigella … no difference … “Camera - a very hot under the collar @mark_adderley,” she added, tagging her husband with some laughing emojis. Nadia then added the hashtags: “#cookingporn #foodporn #nigellalawson #nigellalawsoneatyourheartout #nigellalawsonrecipe #sensualcooking #sexykitchen.” (sic)
