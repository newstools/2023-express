Fawlty Towers is set to be revived after more than 40 years, with star John Cleese returning to write and star in the new series alongside his daughter Camilla Cleese. But do you think the British sitcom should be rebooted? Vote in our poll.   The comedy followed hotelier Basil Fawlty and his wife Sybil,  played by Mr Cleese and Prunella Scales as they tried to keep their Torquay hotel and marriage together. The show aired on the BBC from 1975 to 1979 with just 12 episodes over two series. Earlier this week Castle Rock Entertainment announced it had closed a deal with Mr Cleese to revive the show which will reportedly explore how Mr Fawlty manages the modern world while running a boutique hotel and the return of his long-lost daughter.

Matthew George and Derrick Rossi will also be part of the production team. Mr Cleese said: “When we first met, he [Matt] offered an excellent first idea, and then Matt, my daughter Camilla, and I had one of the best creative sessions I can remember. By dessert, we had an overall concept so good that, a few days later, it won the approval of Rob and Michele Reiner. Camilla and I look forward enormously to expanding it into a series.” Mr Reiner said: “John Cleese is a comedy legend. Just the idea of working with him makes me laugh.” Mr Cleese said in an interview in 2009 that the cast would never make another episode because they are “too old and tired”. So what do YOU think?
