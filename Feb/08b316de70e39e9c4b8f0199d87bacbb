If your broadband and Sky TV bill are making you wince then BT may have the perfect solution to reduce those monthly outgoings. The UK telecoms firm has launched a limited-time deal which is offering full Internet access plus the option to have popular Sky channels beamed into your home with prices starting from just £39.99 per month. That low cost includes BT's Fibre 2 broadband service along with channels such as Sky Atlantic, Sky Max and Sky Showcase - there's even Netflix included as well so you can watch boxsets such as the latest Drive to Survive series and award-winning movies like All Quiet on the Western Front. To make sure you never miss a moment of your favourite programmes, BT includes its recordable TV box which offers a whopping 300 hours of storage space. You can also pause and rewind live TV using this device. This entertainment and broadband bundle usually costs £51.99 per month but, for the next week, those signing up will find they pay just £39.99 - that's a total saving of £347 over the term of the contract. If you prefer sporting action rather than entertainment there's another bundle which features all four BT Sport channels plus Eurosport 1 and 2 for £39.99 - that's an £11 per month saving. Finally, there's the ultimate sporting bundle which includes Fibre 2 broadband plus BT and Sky Sports for £71.99 - saving £4 per month. These sports bundles also feature that Sky Q-style BT TV box.
