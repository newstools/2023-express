Media watchdog Ofcom has told ITV and Sky News to “explain their actions” after privacy complaints from the family of Nicola Bulley. In a blistering statement on Monday, a day after the 45-year-old mother of two’s body was found in the River Wyre, relatives said despite their pleas to be left alone, the broadcasters contacted them.  They said: “We tried last night to take in what we had been told in the day, only to have Sky News and ITV making contact with us directly when we expressly asked for privacy.” Ofcom said on Tuesday: “We are extremely concerned. We have written to ITV and Sky to ask them to explain their actions. We will then assess whether any further action is required.” Sky, which had opened a dialogue with Nicola’s family and police after she went missing at St Michael’s on Wyre, Lancashire, on January 27, said it would work closely with the regulator. ITV said: “As a responsible broadcaster, we will co-operate fully and respond in detail to Ofcom’s request for information. “We express sincere condolences to the family at this difficult time and we will not be commenting further.”  Lancashire Police has faced a backlash over its investigation into mortgage adviser Nicola and for releasing highly personal details of her private life. The force is holding an internal probe into how they handled the case. Police chiefs have accused online “TikTokers” of “playing private detectives” near the scene and interfering with the search. Experts claim social media algorithms that reward and encourage controversial content fuelled waves of online interest. On Tuesday, video hosting service TikTok vowed to act against those who disrupted the search and posted distressing conspiracy theories. Areeq Chowdhury, of the Royal Society, told MPs people taking selfies at the site may have been seeking a sense of “personal validation” or were hoping to make money from online clicks.
