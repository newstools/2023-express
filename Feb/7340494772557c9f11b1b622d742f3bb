F1 roars into life at the Bahrain Grand Prix in just 13 days with pre-season testing scheduled to begin later this week. Alpine became the last constructor to lift the covers off their new 2023 design last week as excitement levels rise ahead of the new campaign. Lewis Hamilton could risk being slapped with heavy penalties if he breaks the FIA's new rules around political gestures. The FIA dialled back their tough stance on protests last Friday amid criticism from drivers and teams. However, the rules clearly state sanctions could be applied if drivers make protests on-track in a major blow to the seven-time champion. Meanwhile, Mercedes bosses fear being caught out by letting former test driver Nyck de Vries join nearest rivals Red Bulls junior team. The Dutchman will partner Yuki Tsunoda at AlphaTauri in 2023 after starring in his debut at Monza last season. Charles Leclerc has also ruled out that he was not in negotiations with Mercedes as his contract confusion continues.
