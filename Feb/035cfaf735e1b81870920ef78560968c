The Ford Fiesta was the most stolen car in 2022, with the number of thefts (5,979) up a staggering 53 percent compared to 2021. With almost 6,000 thefts in 2022, compared with 3,909 in 2021, it meant that a Fiesta was stolen every 87 minutes somewhere in the UK. In October, Ford confirmed it would end production of the iconic Fiesta model in 2023, after 47 years of manufacturing. It is Britain’s most-owned car and one of the most desirable models for new drivers, selling more than 22 million units sold. Ford said it was looking at the future, and focused on electric vehicles and meeting the demand for its SUV models. It was a consistent global favourite thanks to its cost efficiency, compact size and easy handling.

That equates to a car stolen from its owner every eight-and-a-half minutes around the UK last year. The Range Rover and Land Rover Discovery both saw thefts rise significantly in 2022, with the Discovery, in particular, moving up two spots in the top 10 table of most stolen cars. There were 12,613 more cars stolen last year than during 2021 (48,493), and 2,464 more than the 58,642 pinched during 2019, pre-pandemic.

He said: “The Ford Fiesta has retained its unenviable title as the most stolen car in Britain, with our research revealing that a Fiesta was stolen every 87 minutes somewhere in the UK last year. “However, it is likely to be the last year it tops the table, as Ford recently announced that it will be discontinuing the Fiesta in June, 47 years after the first model rolled off the production line. “Based on the latest figures, the Range Rover could well head the table next year, with more than 5,500 stolen in 2022, up 47 percent versus 2021.

After the Lexus, two variations of the Hyundai Ioniq were the second and third most stolen, followed by another two models of the Toyota RAV4. Mr Wilmot added: “Car owners need to be aware that thefts are on the rise and to take the appropriate precautions to avoid becoming a victim. “Always make sure your vehicle is locked before you walk away and check that it’s locked at night. “Keep your vehicle keys safe; store them out of sight from windows and doors, don’t leave your car running with the keys in the ignition, and consider using a signal-blocking key. “It’s worth thinking about upgrading the security on your car - particularly if you have a high-value motor. This could include fitting an alarm, immobiliser and tracking system. “And consider another layer of security in the form of a steering wheel lock, which also acts as an effective visual deterrent.”
