Liverpool remains the team on many people's lips after their humiliating 5-2 defeat to Real Madrid in the Champions League last night. However, they are not the only team with things going on with Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea each looking to conduct business while Manchester City have the important matter of their round of 16 clash against RB Leipzig later today. Liverpool fans could scarcely believe themselves when goals from Darwin Nunez and Mohamed Salah had them two-nil up in the space of 14 minutes but from there they capitulated. Karim Benzema and Vinicius Jr both grabbed doubles while centre-half Eder Miltao also got himself on the scoresheet leaving the Reds with a near-impossible task at the Bernabeu in three weeks' time. Understandably, difficult questions have been asked with Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher slamming his former club while the pressure also appears to be getting to Jurgen Klopp given his answers to the media. United are likely to be in the headlines today too with fans on tenterhooks for more details about the club's potential takeover while Arsenal, Chelsea and City are among the other teams likely to be busy.
