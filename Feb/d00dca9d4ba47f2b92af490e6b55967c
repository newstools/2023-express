A brawl at a gym in Merseyside left one man needing hospital treatment for a head injury. The police were called to reports of a fight at a branch of Everlast Gym in Aintree, Merseyside, at about 10.25am this morning (February 28).   Footage obtained by the Liverpool Echo shows four burly men square up in the free weights and cycling machines area before they start throwing punches. One of the men appears to flee followed by another who then comes back to the other two who are still fighting. He can be seen punching one of them at least three times. The scrap continues as gym-goers look on with shouts heard in the background. A woman at the venue shouts "f****** stop" at the men who eventually quit fighting. A Merseyside Police spokesman said: "We can confirm officers were in Aintree following an incident earlier today, Tuesday, February 28. "At around 10.25am, officers were called to Everlast Gym on Ormskirk Road to reports of fighting between males at the location. "A man in his 20s subsequently attended hospital with a head injury."
