On Saturday, Madonna’s brother-in-law, Joe Henry, made the tragic announcement via Instagram. Anthony had been struggling with long-term alcohol addiction and reportedly spent several years living on the streets of Michigan. In the sad announcement, Joe, who is married to Madonna’s sister Melanie Ciccone, confirmed that Anthony had “exited this earthly plane” on Friday night. He penned an emotional statement saying: “I’ve known him since I was 15, in the spring of our lives in Michigan so many years now gone." Alongside a black and white photo of Anthony, the 62-year-old continued: “As brother Dave Henry (who took this photograph) notes here, Anthony was a complex character; and god knows: we tangled in moments, as true brothers can. “But I loved him and understood him better than I was sometimes willing to let on.  “At least for today, no one shall dissuade me from this vision.” Anthony’s cause of death has not yet been released, but fans and friends flocked to pay tribute and share their condolences with the Ciccones. Carolinagengo wrote on Joe’s post: “I was friends and lovers with Anthony in 1987. He was indeed complex. “He was doing well then. He was a talented woodworker.” Rvageek shared: “I have some really fond memories of him growing up. We bonded over our love of Calvin and Hobbes. “I’ll be thinking about him and the Ciccones tonight.” Missabysss added “Such beautiful words and sentiments, Joe. My condolences to you and Melanie.”    Goodfellas actress Debi Mazar wrote a lengthy tribute, remembering the "fond memories of time spent with Anthony back in the late 80’s" "A real Renaissance Man. Full of prose, lover of literature, his Italian Heritage, good wine & cooking. He would drive his 1960’s Cadillac over to my Brooklyn apartment in a snow storm, bring a pot of his freshly prepared Ragu, and all the fixin’s, and we would cook & laugh and talk all night." (sic) Anthony had reportedly struggled long-term with alcoholism and spent a few years homeless, with Page Six claiming he had been living under a bridge in Michigan at one point. Anthony had a rocky relationship with his famous sister and their family, and in 2011 he told the Daily Mail he was “an embarrassment” to them and had been living on the street for 18 months at that time after being sacked by his father from the Ciccone Vineyard and Winery. Madonna is one of eight siblings who grew up in Michigan. Their mother, Madonna Ciccone, died at the age of 30 after a battle with breast cancer when the singer was just five years old. Madonna, Anthony and their four other siblings, Martin, Paula, Melanie and Christopher were raised by their father Tony Ciccone and stepmother Joan Gustafson. When their father remarried, the Ciccone siblings also welcomed two step-siblings, Mario and Jennifer. Express.co.uk has contacted Madonna’s representatives for comment.
