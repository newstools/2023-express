Male violence against women is a “national emergency”, the Domestic Abuse Commissioner has warned. Nicole Jacobs made the comments ­following the killing of Epsom College headteacher Emma Pattison and her seven-year-old daughter Lettie by her husband George in an alleged murder-suicide.   And they come after serial rapist and former police officer David Carrick was given 36 life sentences. He will serve more than 30 years in prison for crimes spanning almost two decades. Ms Jacobs said: “I do think it’s a national emergency. I always hesitate when I hear that type of language because I feel like working in this for so long, nothing has changed in terms of numbers. “The most frequent reason women are murdered is because of domestic abuse. There are many people who have seen it as an emergency for a long time.” Ms Jacobs on Wednesday criticised the Metropolitan Police for being “slow to be assertive” about cases such as Carrick’s.  She said chief ­constables across all forces must tackle police perpetrators of domestic abuse. Ms Jacobs added: “With David Carrick, you think, how was this person allowed to perpetrate domestic abuse for close to 20 years? “How is he allowed to do that with the ­security of being a police officer and the ability to use that against his victims? “Because the Met Police is so huge and has been slow to be assertive about these cases, they’re in the spotlight. This will be happening across [forces], as domestic abuse does. What I want to talk to the Home Secretary about is how we are going to get a grip on what’s happening.”
