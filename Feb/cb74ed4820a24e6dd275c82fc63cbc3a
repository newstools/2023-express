 Gisele Bundchen, 42, has returned to cover girl modelling following her high-profile divorce in October last year. Now, four months post-divorce, the celebrated model is the new cover star of Vogue Italia’s latest issue. This is far from the model’s first cover shoot, having been on the cover of 142 Vogue magazines internationally, but it is her first in over a decade as a single woman. Gisele got married to NFL legend Tom Brady in 2009 after a few years of dating and a month-long engagement. Throughout their relationship, the A-list couple welcomed two children, Benjamin, 11, and Vivian, eight. The new March issue of Vogue Italia is available on February 28.
