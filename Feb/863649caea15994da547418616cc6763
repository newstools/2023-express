The 2023 Formula One season grows ever closer with just 17 days to go until lights out in Bahrain. By the end of today, we will have seen every teams car for the year ahead as Alpine show the A523 to the public for the first time following on from the launches of Mercedes and Ferrari over the past couple of days. It wouldn't be Formula One without a little bit of controversy and the 2023 off-season has been no different. FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem is not the most popular person in the paddock at the moment after a public intervention into the sale price of the sport while the governing bodies rules on free speech have annoyed drivers with some including Lewis Hamilton and Lando Norris prepared to defy them. We will get a better feel for the season when pre-season testing gets underway in Bahrain next week as manufacturers are able to test their cars for the first time. Max Verstappen and Red Bull will be the team to beat after their dominance in 2022 but the likes of Hamilton, George Russell and Charles Leclerc will be doing everything in their power to ensure that does not happen. Stick with us as we bring you all the latest updates from the world of Formula One today as we all start to get excited for the year ahead...
