Pamela Anderson looks every bit like Marilyn Monroe as she chomps her breakfast to promote her new memoir and documentary. But the former Playboy model, 55, who wore fifties-style hair like the movie star for the tasty photoshoot, wants people to know she is more than just a pretty face. Speaking to WSJ Magazine she said: “Part of my life is always trying to get over that hump, convincing people I’m capable of anything because of my image.” Pamela said a lot of her career was based on “being in a bathing suit, running around on the beach, lip gloss and eyeliner and big hair”. The Baywatch beauty insisted she was “a lot more than that” as she released her memoir Love, Pamela on Tuesday. On the same day, Pamela, A Love Story landed on Netflix. The documentary was produced by her son Brandon Thomas Lee, 26, to give the mother of two a chance to provide her own narrative following the recent Hulu miniseries Pam And Tommy about her turbulent marriage to rock drummer Tommy Lee, 60.
