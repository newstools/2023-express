A major search for a missing baby is underway in Brighton. The parents of the child have been arrested after going missing with the baby on January 5. Constance Marten and Mark Gordon went missing with the baby near Bolton. The couple were located by Sussex police officers in Stanmer Villas on Monday night, after a member of the public spotted the pair around 9:30pm.  35-year-old Marten and 48-year-old Gordon abadoned their car on the M61 near Bolton. The vehicle was found burning. From Bolton the pair travelled to Liverpool, before moving to Harwich in Essex, then onto east London and most recently Sussex. Detective Superintendant Lewis Basford from the Metropolitan Police told the BBC: “We joined Sussex police overnight. We’ve got both sussex and metropolitan police officer deployed on the open land search. “It is a vast area and at the present we are looking in the local vicinity to where the couple were arrested last night.  He went on: “[We are] seeking a shelter or location for where they may have been held up and hopefully where the baby is present. “At this time we’ve got no information from the inquiries we've had since the arrest that are leading us to any location where the baby is. "We’re certainly working on the premise that the arrest location was close to open land and that the couple moving towards that land. "That’s why we are focusing heavily on where we are right now." Constance Marten grew up in a stately home in Dorset, meeting Gordon in 2016 whilst a drama student. After meeting Gordon, Marten became estranged from her family.  Gordon is a registered sex offender who was deported from the United States to Britain in 2010, after committing a rape aged 14 and serving a 20-year sentence. Napier Marten, the father of Constance, told the Independent: "Even though we remain estranged at the moment, I stand by as I have always done, and as the family has always done, to do whatever is necessary for your safe return to us".
