The Queen’s Gambit actress Anya turned heads at the BAFTAs 2023 in an elaborate ensemble, switching up the staple red carpet-worthy minidress with a matching brown velvet shawl.  The star’s eye-catching outfit, designed by Schiaparelli, flaunted her enviably toned legs while making a statement with its extravagant matching headgear.  Singer Ellie Goulding joined The Menu actress in causing a stir with her sartorial choices for the event, held in London’s Royal Festival Hall.  The Love Me Like You Do hitmaker went braless as awards season hit the UK, highlighting her cleavage in a sheer grey dress, complete with billowing dramatic sleeves.  British model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, 35, also caught the eye in a fashion-forward outfit, as she flaunted her thighs in a racy scalloped skirt, exposing her bodysuit underneath.
