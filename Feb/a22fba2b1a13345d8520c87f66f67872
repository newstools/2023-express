 New City College, in east London, was locked down after a stabbing took place this morning. A male, whose age is unconfirmed, was rushed to the hospital after being stabbed at around 10:41am.    He was stabbed on Ardleigh Green Road, prompting the pupils in Hornchurch to be told they weren’t allowed to leave the classrooms, according to MyLondon. Now the school is being evacuated. The male’s condition is not known at present. Ardleigh Green Road has been closed off by the Met Police.    Officers have urged people to avoid the area. No arrest has been made yet, with the attacker still on the loose. With the road closed off by Met officers, those parked near the school have not been able to access their vehicles due to the cordon. Speaking with MyLondon, a mother whose daughter attends the school revealed that all the children have been rushed home.    A spokesperson for the school said: “We are investigating what happened and the college is currently on lockdown so no students can come in.” A notice for staff on what appears to be the internal website, seen by MyLondon, stated: “Please keep students in your classroom until further notice whilst an incident is being managed off-site from College. “Look out for further updates.”
