A construction worker has died after he was trapped under a five-ton concrete slab for seven hours after an eighth-floor balcony collapsed in Jersey Shore. Jose Pereira, who worked for Ferugson Constructing Inc in Philadelphia, was pinned underneath a collapsed eighth-floor balcony weighing 11,000 pounds. The 43-year-old was pronounced dead around 10pm on Friday by a Cape May forensic nurse after he was pinned down at 2.30pm. Witness Joye Fiocchi told CBS News: "Just total chaos. Just people screaming. I called 911 right away. "And it's just 20 minutes later, I heard him screaming again. I guess he was saying get it off of me, and I never heard anything [after]."

Police had attemped to rescue Pereira but were unable to reach him due to "significant cracks" and the building was considered "unsafe". Rescue teams got to Pereira after bringing in more equipment to stabilise the seventh-floor balcony. They had to cut through 12 inches of reinforced concrete. Residents of the building were evacuated and and will not be allowed back in until private engineers conduct inspections.
