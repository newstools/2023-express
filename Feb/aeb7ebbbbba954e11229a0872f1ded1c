The Duchess of Sussex seems to be working far from the spotlight on her next profitable projects. Following the release of the biographical six-part Netflix documentary Harry and Meghan, the Duchess has taken a step back from the public eye in recent weeks. While Prince Harry sat down for several interviews to promote his memoir Spare, the 41-year-old remained silent and has only been spotted attending, among other Hollywood A-listers, the renewal of the wedding vows between Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi. However, commentator Camilla Tominey suggest that, while publicly silent, she is likely working behind the scenes on her next big move. Ms Tominey mentioned reports suggesting the Sussexes are now working with venture capitalist and entrepreneur Adam Lilling. The Duchess has also been linked to Gordon Getty, following reports they were seen having lunch together. Royal expert Ms Tominey discusses suggestions of "rom coms, feel good and light-hearted programmes" being on the Sussex agenda. The commentator wrote in the Daily Telegraph: "So while she may have taken a step back from the spotlight, behind the scenes, Meghan appears to once again be on manoeuvres."
