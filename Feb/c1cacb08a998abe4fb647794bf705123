A drunk yob attacked his girlfriend's step-father after being told football is "just a game". Anthony Griffin, 29, and his partner's step-dad John Ashcroft had just watched Liverpool play Real Madrid in the Champions League final last year, which the Reds lost 1-0. An argument ensued between Griffin and Mr Ashcroft, during which the victim said "it is just a game". But Griffin made threats and threw Mr Ashcroft to the floor in the victim's own home in Bootle, Merseyside. Edward Rattigan, prosecuting, said the defendant punched Mr Ashcroft in the head and gouged his eyes in his drunken rage on May 28, 2022. He also attempted to strangle Mr Ashcroft, before members of the family also present intervened and managed to get Griffin off the victim. Mr Ashcroft ran inside his house and locked the door, but Griffin followed, and was described as "screaming and banging on the window to get back inside", but was unable to. The victim was left with scratches to his face and sore eyes, but no serious injuries. Griffin has a previous conviction for assault in 2010, Liverpool Echo says.  Steven Charters, defending, detailed that this attack was out of character for Griffin, and he deeply regrets it. He said: “He showed vast amounts of mitigation, remorse and regret. "He accepted that it should not have happened. It was a foolish, one-off spontaneous event. It must be pretty awful to have such an offence occur in your own home.” In sentencing, District Judge James Clarke said: “Choking is the most significant feature to the assault, but I accept this was out of character.” Griffin was sentenced to a community order for 18 months, and was ordered to complete 20 rehabilitation days and 200 hours of unpaid work. He was also ordered to complete 60 days of abstinence monitored by a tag, and pay compensation costs of £500, plus £120 in prosecution costs and £114 victim surcharge.
