They were created by Chef Nathan Tran of Cream Pot Waikīkī. The chef didn't like pancakes, but he did like souffle, so he combined the two to create the new dish. The pancakes proved incredibly popular in Japan thanks, in part, to their very cute aesthetic. Like most pancakes, they are delicious with various toppings. Try whipped butter and sugar, maple syrup, Nutella, jam, or fresh berries. Giogia also demonstrated how to make Nutella stuffed pancakes. In her recipe, she showed how to drip a dollop of the Nutella in the pancake mix while cooking to get the perfect stuffed pancake.
