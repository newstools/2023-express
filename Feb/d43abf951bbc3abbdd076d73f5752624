UCPA, a not-for-profit organisation opening up sports for everyone no matter what their income or cultural background, has top value holidays in some of  the biggest resorts in the French Alps that offer high altitude skiing. Available until the end of April, its all-inclusive packages include accommodation (typically shared rooms with four persons), breakfast, lunch and evening dinner –  huge, fresh and healthy buffet feasts, full area lift passes, ski or snowboard equipment rental and for many holidays, instruction too.For dates in April, prices start at around £450pp (Tignes, four day ski break) all-inclusive, whilst a fully guided off-piste experience in Val d’Isère costs from £998pp for seven nights, including ski rental and avalanche safety equipment, full-board accommodation and lift pass.Managing director of Action Outdoors, the UK arm of the UCPA, David Robertson, says: “Late season skiing is one of our favourite times to get out into the mountains and our high altitude resorts mean snow conditions and depths are often at their best. “This year with Easter falling a little earlier, it means good snow conditions are more guaranteed. As spring time takes over, the atmosphere in the centres feels even better than normal, as skiers and snowboarders relax with a drink outdoors in one of the centres bars at the end of the day. “UCPA is well-known for the social activities after skiing and most guests stay around for that before the huge buffet dinner that has become legendary with our guests”.
