For some, Cold Weather Payments would have been triggered three times so far, delivering a £25 payment each time to those eligible in the affected area. The payments are designed to help households pay for energy bills when temperatures plummet. People in England, Wales and Northern Ireland who get certain benefits or support for mortgage interest can qualify for Cold Weather Payments. Britons may get cold weather payments if they’re getting: A person may also need to meet one or more of the following additional criteria to receive the payment: READ MORE: Inheritance tax: Britons warned of 'key considerations' when passing wealth to loved ones  The money will appear in bank statements with a payment reference starting with the customer’s National Insurance number followed by ‘DWP CWP’, for people in England and Wales.

Cold Weather Payments do not affect other benefits and those living in Scotland can not get the payment. Those living in Scotland will no longer be eligible for the Cold Weather Payment as it has now been replaced by the winter heating payment. Instead of a payment based on weather conditions, all eligible households will get a flat £50 each year to help with heating bills. Eligibility is largely the same as the Cold Weather Payment scheme – the difference is that, in Scotland, people must have been getting a relevant benefit for at least one day during a specific qualifying week rather than during the period of cold weather elsewhere. The qualifying week is between November 7, to November 13, 2022. The Scottish Government will start making payments to eligible households from February 2023. Minister for Pensions, Laura Trott, said: “These additional payments provide support every year to help people experiencing the coldest weather. “Cold Weather Payments can be triggered right through to the end of March, giving people facing disproportionately cold weather that extra reassurance over the chillier months. “We’re committed to protecting the most vulnerable in our society and this additional help comes on top of wider Government support including £1,200 in direct payments already issued to millions of low-income households this year. “Alongside this, we’re providing households with £400 towards their energy bills this winter, with our Energy Price Guarantee saving the typical household another £900 on top of this.”
