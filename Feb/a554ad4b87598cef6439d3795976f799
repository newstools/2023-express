The incident occurred when Hatch hit the back of the driver’s car in Kirk Brae. When the two men went to inspect the damage, Hatch said his foot had slipped on the brake. When the other driver, who wished to remain anonymous for fear of repercussions, asked if Hatch had been on his phone, Hatch launched into a sweary rant. The incident escalated and Hatch began to attack the driver, got him in a headlock and held him against the rear of his car as shown in footage captured on the driver’s rear-facing dashcam. Speaking to the Metro, the driver said: “It was meant to be a quick trip to the grocery shop, but turned out to be a nightmare. "I only asked him about using his phone, but could not have predicted his reaction and things escalated quickly.” Hatch continued to escalate the assault, holding a plastic fork to the driver’s throat before throwing him onto the pavement. When the victim got himself back into his car, he called the police whilst Hatch continued the abuse. Hatch reportedly shouted through the open window of his van: “Make sure you tell the f*****g truth. I’m insured, so don’t you worry about that.” In a statement after the sentencing of Hatch, the driver said: “I did not want to engage in any confrontation as I worried for the safety of myself and my son, who had to witness the incident from his rear-facing seat.” The driver added the incident had left both him and his son very distressed.
