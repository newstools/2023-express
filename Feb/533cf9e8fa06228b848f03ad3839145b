Each week, The Masked Singer judges try to work out the identities of the mystery celebrities as they drop more clues about who they are. However, the stars have also tried to mask their accents and singing voices, which makes it an even bigger challenge for the panel. On Saturday night, Knitting, Jellyfish, Otter, Fawn, Jacket Potato, Phoenix and Rhino took to the stage to sing in disguise. Davina McCall, Mo Gilligan, Rita Ora and Jonathan Ross were also joined by guest panellist presenter Stephen Mulhern. After each character had performed, Otter was unmasked as Daisy May Cooper, while Knitting was exposed as Claire Richards from Steps. After the unveiling, fans began to share their theories about the remaining acts.

However, many believe Rhino is neither the X Factor star nor the Busted singer. McFly's Danny Jones, Dancing on Ice judge Ashley Banjo and The Wanted's Nathan Sykes are new names thrown into the mix. Taking to Twitter, @heyplatts shared: "Rhino is Danny Jones from McBusted. #TheMaskedSinger #TheMaskedSingerUK #MaskedSinger #MaskedSingerUK." Hannah said: "I still think Rhino is Duncan James, I'm prob wrong tho." (sic) "Not @MoTheComedian guessing Jason Orange as rhino!!#TheMaskedSinger #MaskedSingerUK," Suz added.

"To surprise my daughter Pip, but when she found out I was going to be the Otter she cried and said that it was embarrassing," the comedian told the host. When asked how nervous she was, Daisy added: "It was still nerve-wracking but I had to have the costume. "I would never ever have been able to sing on stage as myself. I would have passed out and face-planted the audience otherwise!" Speaking about her stint on the show as Knitting, the Steps singer said: "I am a massive, massive fan of this show. "I feel like a fan who has won a competition! It’s been amazing and I’ve just loved it.” The Masked Singer returns on Saturday at 7pm on ITV.
