The partner of missing Nicola Bulley has released an updated statement as he thanks the new search team for their efforts in finding the missing mum-of-two. In a new statement released through Lancashire Police, Nicola Bulley's partner Paul Ansell said: "It's been 10 days now since Nicola went missing and I have two little girls who miss their mummy desperately and who need her back. "This has been such a tough time for the girls especially but also for me and all of Nicola's family and friends, as well as the wider community and I want to thank them for their love and support. "We are also really grateful to Peter and his team from SGI for coming up and helping support the work of Lancashire Police as they continue their investigation. "If anyone has any information which could help find Nicola, I urge them to get in touch with the police and help us provide the answers we all so badly need." Police also released a new image of Nicola from the day of her release in a bid to jog people's memories.  Detective Superintendent Rebecca Smith, of Lancashire Police, said: "The team working on this investigation are completely dedicated and determined to find Nicola. "As a mother myself, I can’t even begin to imagine what her two children are going through. "Please be reassured that our sole focus is Nicola and that we are doing everything we can to find her. "It is not possible to provide every piece of information to the public because to do so would detract from the investigation, but I’d like to thank everyone who has assisted us so far and for the support provided to Nicola’s family at this extremely difficult time. "They are being supported and updated throughout." READ MORE: All the clues we have about Nicola Bulley so far
