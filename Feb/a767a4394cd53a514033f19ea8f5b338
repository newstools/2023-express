A female employee working at the well-known brothel has been arrested after police responded to reports of "multiple gunshots" at the site, according to police. Officers from the Carson City and Lyon County Sheriff’s Office report receiving calls of “multiple gunshots” coming from The Moonlite Bunny Ranch, off Highway 50 in Mound House, Nevada, at around 10 pm on Monday night. Once they arrived on the scene, officers were quick to evacuate the building, Lyon County Sheriff Brad Pope said in a news release. The Lyon County Sheriff’s Office Crisis Negotiations Team (CNT), Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT), and Technology Team were also dispatched to the scene. The force is also believed to have attempted to contact the female shooter, believed to be an employee, on a loudspeaker. They entered the brothel after 12am but reported no injuries inside. Police then identified and detained the shooter just after 12:30am who had retreated into one of the brothel's rooms, the Sheriff's Office said. Officers then investigated the building to ensure there were no further threats, Carson News Now reported. Police are believed to have received a call about a dispute between two co-workers just before the shooting occurred, the paper reported.
