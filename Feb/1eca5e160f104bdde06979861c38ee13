US military authorities have spotted Russian nuclear bombers twice over two days as they flew close to the coast of Alaska. A video released by the Kremlin shows two of its Tu-95 "Bear" bombers close to American airspace in a defiant show of strength to the West.  The footage reportedly displays the missile carriers flying over neutral waters in the Bering Sea along with Russian fighter jets. The carriers were seen flying close to US airspace on February 14 with the mission interpreted as a red signal to the West in retaliation for its supplies of weapons to Ukraine. However, another video emerged online which appeared to show a second sortie flown by the Russians over 48 hours.  The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) said it "detected, tracked, positively identified and intercepted four Russian aircraft approaching Alaska, Air Defense Identification Zone of Feb, 14." NORAD said this was the "second intercept of Russian aircraft over two days". It added that the Russian aircraft included TU-95 Bear H, SU-30 fighter and SU-35 fighter aircraft. They were intercepted by two F-35A fighters supported by two F-16 fighters, one E-3 Sentry (AWACS) and two KC-135 Stratotankers.

One of the planes can then be seen taking to the skies before the other can also be seen taking off. The footage then shows the view from inside the cockpit of one of the aircraft. Other shots also show the other plane, both of them apparently flying high above the clouds.
