A British man collapsed and died after disembarking a British Airways flight to South Africa. Michael Morris died after leaving the plane with his wife following the 11-hour flight to Johannesburg's Tambo Internal Airport. He had visited the washroom after leaving flight BA057 while waiting to collect his luggage when he collapsed in the international arrivals toilet, the CEO of airline firm Airports Company South Africa (ACSA) revealed. Mpumi Mpofu said he suddenly collapsed and received immediate medical aid but died on the scene. He said: "Acsa paramedics responded immediately and attended to Mr Morris but he was declared dead at the scene and we provided assistance to his distraught wife." His wife was reportedly with family members at the time of her husband's death. A British Embassy official also aboard the plane helped command the situation while offering consular support to the grieving widow.
