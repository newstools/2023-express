Plane fan Kenneth Mockford built a replica Spitfire after years of work on a flight simulator in his garden shed. His challenge, which took off during 2020's lockdown, has resulted in a perfect double of the front half of the iconic Second World War fighter. The South African air force veteran spent £30,000 on parts for the fuselage, making many from scratch, which he assembled in the 10ft by 16ft building using blueprints. Kenneth, 59, from Burwell, Cambs, said: “I have Asperger’s Syndrome and I always say that it is my gift... my superpower. “As I have that, I have the skill of being able to analyse things to the nth degree and I can see things in a way that other people cannot. "You don’t think about the money when it’s £500 here and £1,000 there, but it adds up.” He quit his engineering job in 2014 and turned his shed into a hangar. The ex-mechanic also rewired the fronts of a Lynx helicopter and Boeing 737 and now runs flight simulator firm Sim2do in Mildenhall, Suffolk. His mocked-up Spitfire cockpit even vibrates when its trigger is used and features instruments, throttle, landing gear and seat in front of three screens. Kenneth said: “People with autism and Asperger’s often get ridiculed by the general population because they are not the same as everyone else. “But the general person looks at the world through normal eyes and we look at the world in 3D.” The dad of two said his family thought he had “lost it” when he set out, but added: “When I completed one they were like, ‘Wow!’”
