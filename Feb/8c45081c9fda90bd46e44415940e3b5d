The earthquake death toll has reached a combined 15,000 this morning, with the chances of survival for those still trapped under razed buildings decreasing dramatically. Experts have estimated that, while most people will have survived in the 24 hours following the devastating tremors, as the week moves on, only six percent of people found underneath the rubble will be recovered alive. The latest toll sits close to 16,000, with Turkish authorities estimating that fatalities grew by more nearly 500 overnight to 12,873, up from Wednesday's total of 12,391. Syria's total remains in the 2,000 range, standing at 2,992, but the civil war means that volunteer organisations are left to report fatalities, with no central agency able to reliably tally deaths across the country. The overall number of deaths between Turkey and Syria now stands at 15,865. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
