Buckingham Palace will be planning for three separate scenarios over Harry and Meghan's attendance at the Coronation, a royal commentator has said. Creator of the To Di For Daily podcast, Kinsey Schofield, said the Sussexes had to be invited to the historic occasion on May 6 to avoid a "PR nightmare". She told GB News: "The palace is planning for three separate scenarios: Harry and Meghan show up; only Harry shows up or neither show up. "They've asked everybody to RSVP as quickly as possible - early April - so they're trying to plan so that King Charles is the focus of the Coronation, however, admitting that they realise that Harry and Meghan would be a great distraction."
