Joan Collins and Florence Pugh were among the famous faces leaving the glitzy after party for the BAFTAs 2023. Joan, 89, put on a very glamorous display in a gold sequinned jacket paired with matching black trousers. She was pictured leaving British Vogue's after party at London private members' club, Annabel's, and got a helping hand from her husband Percy Gibson, 58. Florence Pugh also opted for a sequinned ensemble in a tiny mini dress. The actress showcased her long legs in the pink number, which she elevated with a pair of sky-high platform heels. Lily James and Billie Piper looked like they had a ball as they left the bash in fits of laughter.
