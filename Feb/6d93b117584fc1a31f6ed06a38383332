Jurgen Klopp says Liverpool will still be without Luis Diaz, Thiago Alcantara, Ibrahima Konate and Calvin Ramsay on Saturday when they travel to Newcastle as they look to inflict the Magpies' second Premier League defeat of the campaign. Eddie Howe's side have only lost once in 22 top-flight outings this term and that defeat came at the hands of the Reds way back in September when Fabio Carvalho struck a last-gasp winner. Now Liverpool are plotting a similar result at St James' Park when only victory will really do if they wish to catch the Magpies in the race for Champions League football. Nonetheless, Klopp's men will have to do it without injured quarter Diaz, Thiago, Konate and Ramsay, who are yet to return to full fitness. Young right-back Ramsay has actually been forced to undergo surgery on his meniscus, meaning his season is already over.
