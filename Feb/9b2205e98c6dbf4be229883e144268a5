The January transfer window has finally closed and it did not disappoint, with plenty of last-minute drama taking place across the Premier League and elsewhere in Europe on deadline day. Chelsea and Manchester United were among the clubs to have left it incredibly late to add to their respective squads, while the likes of Arsenal, Newcastle and Leeds also pounced in the last few hours of the mid-season window. Chelsea were locked in negotiations with Benfica all day but eventually managed to agree a British record move for World Cup hero Enzo Fernandez, who joins the Blues for a transfer fee in the region of Â£105million. The 21-year-old is yet to be officially unveiled by the west Londoners but the move is understood to be done, opening up the possibility of a debut for Fernandez against Fulham in the Premier League on Friday night. Manchester United also managed to strike late with the loan signing of Marcel Sabitzer, who joins the Red Devils from Bayern Munich after Christian Eriksen was ruled out for several months with a long-term injury. The 28-year-old flew into the UK for a medical just hours before the deadline but was able to complete the formalities in time for his arrival to be officially announced in the early hours of Wednesday morning.
