Matthew actor Olly said: "They row, don't they, they fight with each other and I think that's something Helen and I enjoyed and talked about. "As actors, we thought let's not just present the fairytale," he explained how they wanted to show "complications and conflict". He added: "There is some conflict there and I think she calls him on his privilege a lot and I think he is man enough to take it. "But I think it hurts a bit sometimes...like back in, I can't remember what series it was when [she] threw something at me from the stairs. "She gives him a hard time and, I don't know if it needs work because I think it's quite a good thing. "But if you were a therapist I might say to you, can you ask her to talk to me in a kinder way." On what she likes about their relationship, Helen added: "I think, it's kind of connected to the arguing, but there's a passion between them. DON'T MISS...

"But also something that drives them because they are so different and they are from such different worlds. "Yet they work, they really work, even though there's sort of a butting of heads constantly. "But it's that butting of heads that brings them together because they do get through to each other. "So I would be reluctant to say let's take the arguing away." Olly added: "The arguing is tough but it's the best thing really because it takes them to a place of really brutal honesty. "And that's hard to do in any relationship and friendship. They really augment all the wonderful things about one another by enabling conflict." The series has just been renewed for another two seasons, meaning it will air up until at least 2026.  Call the Midwife returns to BBC One on Sunday, February 26, at 8pm.
