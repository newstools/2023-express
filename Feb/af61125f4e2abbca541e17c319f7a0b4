Gina Miller said he was “aggressive and intimidating” during an “aggressive encounter”. But allies of the Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Secretary described the latest claims as “baseless” and provided further evidence of a politically motivated vendetta to oust him. Mrs Miller, 57, who has launched her own political party, said the Tory MP “launched into an abusive attack on me” while in a BBC studio to debate Brexit in 2016. In an article, she claimed he said: “I can’t make up my mind if you’re naive, got too much money or just stupid.” Mr Raab was “furious” when she was told by a young man that a car was ready to pick her up, Mrs Miller said, adding that he shouted at the man: “Go get me a ******* car.” Mrs Miller said: “Raab was aggressive and intimidating, and I was bullied and demeaned. “This was an aggressive male expressing seemingly misogynistic behaviour. This sort of behaviour is not acceptable from anyone, especially not from a powerful politician.” A source close to Mr Raab told the Daily Express: “These are baseless and malicious claims, timed to jump on a political bandwagon and give Gina Miller the publicity she craves.” Dozens of officials are believed to be involved in the inquiry into allegations against Mr Raab. The complaints span his time at the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Defence and the Department for Exiting the European Union. Mr Raab denies allegations of bullying. The PM, who sacked Nadhim Zahawi as Tory chairman over his tax affairs, has so far resisted pressure to suspend Mr Raab. He is also standing by Cabinet Secretary Simon Case despite No 10 not denying he may have failed to advise Mr Sunak of a written complaint about Mr Raab. It was reported Mr Case was personally informed of a complaint months before Mr Sunak appointed his ally to the Cabinet.
