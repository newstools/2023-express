Nintendo fans are about to be treated to a second Direct conference in 2023, just weeks after the February presentation. The upcoming Nintendo Direct presentation has been given a March 9 air date on the Nintendo website and YouTube. The show kicks off at 10pm GMT UK time, so it might prove a little late for some people. There's even more bad news if you're hoping for some Switch reveals, because the March 9 Nintendo Direct will focus exclusively on the upcoming Super Mario Bros Movie. Indeed, the Direct will feature the final trailer for the movie before it makes its big screen debut in April. The news was announced by Nintendo on Twitter, alongside confirmation that no games will make an appearance during the conference. "Join us at 22:00 (UK time) on 09/03 for the world premiere of The Super Mario Bros. Movie's final trailer!" reads a Nintendo tweet. "No game information will be included in this Nintendo Direct." The upcoming Super Mario Bros Movie has an April 7 release date in cinemas. The computer animated movie stars Chris Pratt as the voice of Mario, and Charlie Day as Luigi. Anya Taylor-Joy will provide the voice of Princess Peach, while Jack Black will play serial kidnapper Bowser. Keegan-Michael Key, Seth Rogen, Fred Armisen and Kevin Michael Richardson will also voice characters in the movie, alongside long-running video game voice actor Charles Martinet. Fans will be hoping the new movie is better than the live action effort from 1993, which was a critical flop. That's despite a cast featuring the likes of Bob Hoskins, Dennis Hopper and John Leguizamo.
