Ola Jordan, 40, left her fans in hysterics this week as she poked fun at her newfound confidence in white lace lingerie as she did the food shop. The clip saw the former Strictly Come Dancing pro returning from the supermarket with her bags in tiny lingerie. Her husband, James Jordan, lightheartedly hit back at his wife's antics from the window, shouting: "We get it you've lost weight!" Issuing a warning to his body-confident other half, James said: "You've got to start putting clothes on, people get it, well done, you've lost weight, but you've got to start putting clothes on it's getting boring." Ola's white lingerie featured lace and sheer panelling as well as a thong design, which she flashed when turning her back to the camera. She captioned the post in view of her 331,000 Instagram followers: "I don’t remember telling anyone I’ve lost weight but now he mentioned it I might as well tell you how I did."
