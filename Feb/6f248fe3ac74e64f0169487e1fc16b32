Footage shows the man, who has not been identified, walking up to the McLaren, and bouncing up and down on its roof and windscreen. Passers-by appear to walk past as the individual does thousands of pounds worth of damage to the vehicle. Other reports suggest members of the public screamed at him to get off, but to no avail. Footage later showed the individual handcuffed by police, but Scotland Yard said the investigation is ongoing and no arrests have been made. The car is owned by celebrity supercar dealer George Gehdu. Mr Gehdu’s clients include David De Gea and Wilfred Zaha. Posting on Instagram, Mr Gehdu said: “Firstly I appreciate the support massively, not just people across the country but across the world, to see if everything is alright I’m all good. “I wasn’t involved in anything, it was just some scrawny little rat, nevertheless the police came in good time a car is a car. He definitely took his time and tried to damage it as much as possible, nevertheless, I’m still out here and I’m still moving and that’s the main thing. I was parked right opposite the barber shop, which I can normally see. The guy didn’t care that there were people watching or screaming at him. I still believe there are good people out there, it's not going to stop me from taking my car to a place like that.” A spokesperson for the Met Police said: “Police are investigating a report of criminal damage to a car that is alleged to have occurred in Baker Road, Uxbridge, on the morning of Sunday, 12 February. “Enquiries are ongoing and no arrests have been made.”
