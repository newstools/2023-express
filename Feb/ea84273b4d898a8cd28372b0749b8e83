Researchers at the University of Wolverhampton received £122,000 to fund their pioneering work, 63 years after the first female birth control pill was approved for use in 1960. The cash injection from the Male Contraceptive Initiative in the US will help in the creation of reversible and non-hormonal drugs. Two main types of birth control pill for women exist – the combined pill and the progesterone-only pill. The latter pill contains no oestrogen and both are free on the NHS. The university is working with scientists in Portugal, Brazil and Australia on the next “crucial” stage of making the first ever equivalent pill for men. John Howl, Professor of Molecular Pharmacology, said developments such as these had attracted “significant commercial interest” and that he was confident “this research will provide substantial benefits” for the university. The team plans to spend the money over the next two years to create an easily accessible male contraceptive, which reduces the motility and effectiveness of sperm. They hope this can be eventually developed into a new form of birth control. Dr Sarah Jones, a member of the university’s molecular pharmacology research group, said it was “an exceedingly exciting time”. She added: “Finally, years of dedicated effort have come to fruition.”
