Ukraine has been accused of “extensively scattering landmines” in the northeast region of Kharkiv that contravene a major war pact signed by the defending nation in 1999, resulting in nearly a dozen casualties. The Human Rights Watch group called for an investigation into the Ukrainian forces for their use of anti-personnel mines in the city of Izyum as part of their liberation efforts in September. The mines, which were “scattered by aircraft, rockets and artillery” instead of being placed by hand, have not been properly cleared since the recapturing of the city and now “hinder the delivery of humanitarian aid and prevent agricultural activities”, according to the HRW. The calls come as a top Ukrainian official hinted there could be a Ukrainian offensive in the “next two to three weeks” to combat an expected spring attack from Russian forces.
