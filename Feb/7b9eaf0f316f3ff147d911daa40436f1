The study also found former fighters were struggling with addiction to the internet, especially Twitter. Speaking to the AAN, Omar Mansur, 32, a Taliban Commander now civil servant, said: “We had a great degree of freedom about where to go, where to stay, and whether to participate in the war. “These days, you have to go to the office before 8am and stay there until 4pm. If you don’t go you’re considered absent, and [the wage for] that day is cut from your salary.” Among the other complaints were the traffic and high rent in the city of Kabul.

He added that the traffic congestion was also becoming a problem: “What I don’t like about Kabul is its ever-increasing traffic hold-ups. Last year, it was tolerable but in the last few months, it’s become more and more congested.” One result of moving to an office job has been greater access to the internet. However, this could now be leading to a problem. Abdul Nafi, 25, a civil servant, said: “In our ministry, there’s little work for me to do. “Therefore, I spend most of my time on Twitter. We’re connected to speedy Wi-Fi. Many mujahedin, including me, are addicted to the internet, especially Twitter.” While work may be quiet as civil servants, the country they serve continues to face a difficult winter. According to reports by the Washington Post, millions of Afghans have been suffering through a cold winter under the Taliban. Nationwide, around 160 people have died of hypothermia while their livestock perishes in their thousands. According to the World Food Programme, around 20 million people are facing “emergency-level food insecurity”. Alongside humanitarian issues, the country also experienced a powerful magnitude 6.0 earthquake last year.
