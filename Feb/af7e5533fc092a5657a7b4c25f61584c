  Jamie looked worlds away from how he appears on TV in the social media post and, even more confusingly, had totally straight hair in the pic he shared with his wife to his own Instagram. In Jools’ post she paid tribute to her partner of 30 years, writing: “Happy [love] day to my everything and my favourite over 30 Valentines later.” (sic) The pair’s fans rushed to the comments to give their opinions on Jamie’s new look, with Janine writing: “Is that Jamie???? Looks so different.” (sic) “Who are you kissing!?” joked Tom, while Matt quipped: “That's not Jamie.” “Is this some kind of secret lover reveal?” Lucy teased, while another user asked: “Is that a perm?”
