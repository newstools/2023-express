Convicted killer Donald Wallace, 75, was found beaten to death in his apartment last week - 50 years after he had committed murder himself, police say. Officers were alerted to the 75-year-old's murder after they received a call about a "foul odour", suggesting Wallace had been dead for some time, ABC reported. An autopsy revealed that he died after suffering a hit over the head, which has been ruled as homicide. But his home showed no sign of forced entry and nothing appeared to have been taken from inside. Once inside the West 23rd Street apartment in NYCHA’s Carey Gardens complex in Coney Island, police found Wallace unconscious and unresponsive, police said. His body was found just after 5pm on Thursday and he was pronounced dead at the scene.  No arrests have been made yet and there is no clear motive for the killing. Wallace had served a 20-year sentence for murder 50 years previously, state records show. He was also convicted of robbery, criminal possession of a weapon and grand larceny in his conviction for the 1972 murder.

Following his death, locals in the area have expressed their sadness describing him as a "very nice person". His friend Milagros Correa told ABC: "Shouldn't have died that way, because he was a very nice person, you could ask him for anything and he would give it to you, you know." A separate friend, Tamika Congress, said: "I was speaking to him after she passed away and he was kinda heavy on the heart but a good person."
