According to American and other Wested officials, Russian troops wounded and killed in Ukraine are now approaching the 200,000 threshold. Numbers are difficult to confirm, officials warn, but fighting in and around the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut and the town of Soledar has significantly upped the toll. Meanwhile, Volodymyr Zelensky is meeting with the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and President of the European Council, Charles Michel, in Kyiv today as part of an EU-Ukraine summit on the war, as well as the possibility of further sanctions on Russia and integrating Ukraine into the EUâ€™s internal market.
