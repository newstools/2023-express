The fourth season of Netflix's critically acclaimed dating show is back and will premiere its first set of episodes on March 24, with new episodes dropping weekly until April 14. Despite the excitement for the upcoming season, fans hope season four will be "better" cast following the chaos from previous seasons. The new series of Love Is Blind will be set in Seattle and once again feature a group of hopefuls looking for long-lasting love. The popular show sees a group of single people meet and date each other without ever seeing what the other looks like. As soon as a contestant thinks they have found their match they propose marriage, which allows them to finally meet their supposed soulmate in the flesh. Following their first meeting the lovers get to spend time together before walking down the aisle, where fans really see if the couple have actually found true love.   Netflix has recently announced a UK version of Love Is Blind is in the making. Unfortunately, fans will have to be patient as the series is not expected to air until 2024. The hosts for the UK version are also yet to be confirmed. The first three seasons of Love Is Blind are available to stream on Netflix. Season four will be released on March 24.
