Unlike almost all our peers, the UK economy is still smaller than it was before the pandemic struck. This can partly be explained by a much larger hit from Covid itself, which means that the UK economy was always likely to take longer to recover. The UK data also looks worse than others because our statisticians measure the output of public services, such as health and education, more accurately. This was a big factor during the pandemic, and probably during the ongoing strikes too.The way in which domestic energy prices are set has also made the UK economy particularly vulnerable to the surge in the cost of natural gas.On top of this, the UK Government is one of the very few that still thinks now is a good time to be scaling back help with energy bills and raising taxes, especially on businesses. AstraZeneca’s recent decision to build a new factory in Ireland, because of the “discouraging” tax rate in the UK, says it all.Brexit has played some role too – even if this role is nowhere near as big as many claim. The persistent uncertainty following our departure from the EU has disrupted trade and further deterred investment.More worryingly, this UK underperformance comes on top of a decade of stagnant productivity and weak economic growth in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis. There are many competing explanations for what has gone wrong. But it is surely no coincidence that this has been a period when the state has taken an even bigger role in the economy.There have been many clumsy interventions in key sectors, such as energy and financial services, and the tax burden has climbed to a new record high.Public spending already accounted for around 40 percent of national income before the pandemic and is set to remain well above that level for many years in the future.The Government should therefore refocus on doing less – rolling back the state and cutting taxes – but also doing what it does do much better.Public services, notably health and social care, need fundamental reform if they are going to survive the huge challenges posed by an ageing population.Above all, it has never been more important to make the case for a change in direction and switching to a bold plan for growth, rather than just more of the same.
