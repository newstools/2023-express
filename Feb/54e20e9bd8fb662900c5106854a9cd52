Amanda Holden, 52, stole the show during London Fashion Week as she attended the Julien x Gabriela AW23 show on Sunday. The Britain’s Got Talent judge was joined by her lookalike daughter Lexi Hughes as she stylishly made her way to the Freemasons' Hall. Amanda opted for a daring cut out gown that featured a panelled, mesh top and a thigh-split skirt in black. She paired the risqué gown with a pair of metallic, strappy sandals and a silver clutch, while her hair was styled in loose waves. The TV star complemented the glamorous look with a bold smokey eye and a tan lip. Amanda and her daughter sat front row at the show, next to the presenter’s fellow Heart Radio star Ashley Roberts.
