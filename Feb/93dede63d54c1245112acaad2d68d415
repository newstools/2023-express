There's a big change coming to Sky and Freesat users with the BBC finally switching some of its regional programming over to pin-sharp High Definition (HD). The switchover, which will take place throughout February, will mean viewers will be able to watch their local news without having to change over to Standard Definition (SD) channels. Anyone who regularly watches BBC One HD will be well aware of the annoying holding screen that pops up once the national news ends and the local news begins. That annoyance will now end for most homes with Sky and Freesat both confirming that they will have a full HD service soon. Freeview users should also be switched over to this new service by the spring. So, if you have Sky or Freesat here are the dates you need to know and when your area is getting local BBC services in glorious High Definition.

That's because the BBC is having to shut down its SD versions of channels on the digital satellite platform. This, the BBC says, is not a decision that’s been taken lightly as it means anyone with an SD-only satellite device will lose some popular channels. Sky has already confirmed that it is offering customers with older set-top boxes the option to upgrade to Sky Q for free and it's well worth doing if you think your TV device can't access HD channels. Speaking about the update Kieran Clifton, BBC Director of Distribution says: "By Spring next year, viewers in England will be able to receive BBC One HD for their region and not have to tune away to watch their local news and programming. This, coupled with upgrades to BBC channels that aren’t currently available on some devices in HD, will mean viewers will get a more easily accessible, better quality experience when watching BBC programmes from early next year."
