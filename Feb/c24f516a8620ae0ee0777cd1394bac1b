Everton were reportedly offered the chance to sign Chelsea youngster Omari Hutchinson on loan on transfer deadline day but the Toffees allegedly felt he was too young and inexperienced to make a difference in the second half of the season. The 19-year-old moved to Stamford Bridge from London rivals Arsenal in July and has had several opportunities within Graham Potter's first-team in west London this season. Hutchinson has featured twice against Manchester City this term - once in the Premier League and once in the FA Cup - both of which ended in defeat. Nonetheless, he remains highly rated behind the scenes at Cobham and the Blues were hoping to get him out on loan in January to earn some regular minutes at senior level. According to The Mirror, Chelsea approached Everton and asked them if they wanted to take the attacker on loan for the remainder of the season in the final hours of the window. However, it's claimed Everton felt he was too inexperienced for the relegation battle and instead passed up the opportunity.

The Leicester veteran ended up making the switch across the Midlands to maximise his chances of regular playing time.

Kamaldeen Sulemana and Paul Onuachu both opted to join Southampton over Everton and the Saints will now fancy their chances of survival. Portuguese frontman Beto of Udinese was also the subject of interest but a deal could not be agreed with the Italian outfit. Crystal Palace were also not willing to give up Jean-Philippe Mateta in the final hours of the transfer window.
