Beachgoers gasped in delight at the meteorological phenomenon which was captured perfectly by landscape photographer Steven Lomas as it illuminated the North East skyline. Steven, 36, snapped the breathtaking photo after racing to the Four Sisters Rocks beauty spot on the South Shields coastline, after rushing from his home to take advantage of the sudden clear skies following a day of scattered showers. The group of four rocks stand alone on the beach close to the River Tyne estuary, providing a perfect backdrop for keen nature photographers. Steven said: “It had been showery most of Tuesday morning and I was doing some work in the garden during the drizzle. “I could see it starting to brighten up so I got straight in the car and drove to the closest place I could think of that I hadn’t photographed a rainbow from. “Luckily this amazing double rainbow was present and it stuck around enough for me to get the image I wanted.” Double rainbows are formed when sunlight is reflected twice within a raindrop with the violet light that reaches the observer’s eye coming from the higher raindrops and the red light from lower raindrops. The phenomenon is actually relatively common, especially at times when the sun is low in the sky such as in the early morning or late afternoon. Met Office experts say the second rainbow is fainter and more pastel in tone than the primary rainbow because more light escapes from two reflections compared to one. The secondary rainbow is also dispersed over a wider area of the sky making it nearly twice as wide as the primary bow.
