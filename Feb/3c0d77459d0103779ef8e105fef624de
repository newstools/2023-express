Amanda Holden shared video footage of herself partying at Verde in Dubai, where she proved herself pretty in pink while ringing in her 52nd birthday. Donning a co-ord outfit consisting of a high-waisted mini skirt and matching cropped blazer, she showed off her sensational figure on the way to the restaurant. In an Instagram video, fans saw the Britain's Got Talent judge being presented with a mouthwatering cake while surrounded by her children, who grinned in anticipation. The Amanda and Alan's Italian Job star looked miles more glamorous than in recent episodes of the BBC show, which saw her don a hard hat alongside co-star Alan Carr. Yesterday, she also headed to the beach for some winter sun as her followers marvelled at the pictures and branded her "the fittest 52 year old alive".
