The countdown begins ahead of one of Erik ten Hag's biggest games as Manchester United manager. Barcelona visit Old Trafford in the Europa League on Thursday night, with a spot in the competition's last 16 at stake following a thrilling 2-2 stalemate at the Nou Camp. However, in the background, the saga surrounding the club's ownership rumbles on as bidders continue to await access to financial information, including contracts and sponsorship deals. Three US investment firms have also entered the frame, looking to fund a bid to complete a takeover. Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani and Sir Jim Ratcliffe lodged informal bids before last Friday's soft deadline.

And Kylian Mbappe reportedly may be on his early agenda at Old Trafford ahead of his Paris Saint-Germain contract expiry. Follow LIVE updates below...
