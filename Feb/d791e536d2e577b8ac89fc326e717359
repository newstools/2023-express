Blondie lead vocalist Debbie Harry, 77, looked beyond youthful as she arrived at the prestigious Marc Jacobs fashion event alongside Hollywood actress and pal, Debi Mazar. She ditched her signature blonde hair for her natural silver locks, complemented by her silver double-breasted coat, which featured chunky buttons and a belt. The singer appeared to sport a black dress underneath her statement metallic coat, along with black gloves and boots. She accessorised with several layers of necklaces and showed off her youthful appearance with flawless makeup. Debbie went for shimmering pink eyeshadow, matched with a pink glossy lip, while also showing off her flawless complexion.
