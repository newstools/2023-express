Eugenie also took to Instagram to announce the news, sharing a photo of young son August kissing her bump. In an accompanying post, Eugenie wrote: "We're so excited to share that there will be a new addition to our family this summer." Among those liking her post were her brother-in-law Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi and the Princess of Wales' brother, James Middleton. The baby will be born 13th in line to the throne and will be a third grandchild for Eugenie's parents, Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have reportedly been sending 32-year-old Princess Eugenie, the youngest daughter of Prince Andrew, details of homes close to where they live in Montecito. According to the Daily Mail, the couple are instead looking at homes in the West Hollywood area of Los Angeles, and they plan to rent first before settling down for good. West Hollywood is an affluent suburb of Los Angeles with a population of over 35,000 people. It's frequented by A-listers and ranked as one of Los Angeles' trendiest enclaves. The per capita income in West Hollywood in 2018 was $69,589, or roughly Â£57,000, which is wealthy relative to California and the nation.
