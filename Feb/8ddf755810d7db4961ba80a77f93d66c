Pictures have been released of the suspected Chinese spy balloon being recovered off the US coast. Navy sailors hauled white material from the device into a rescue boat on Sunday - less than 24 hours after an order for it to be shot down by Joe Biden.  Analysis of parts is now underway amid an escalating diplomatic row, with Beijing describing the decision as an "obvious overreaction". The images appear to show the recovery of the balloon’s envelope and a metal frame. Investigators will hope to reach a conclusion on why the flight was spotted floating close to an airforce base on Wednesday. It comes after General Glen VanHerck, commander of the North American Aerospace Defense Command, described it as 200 feet tall and potentially carrying explosives to "destroy" itself. Gen VanHerck also discussed the decision to take the object out of the sky over water, telling a press briefing: "Picture large debris weighing hundreds if not thousands of pounds falling out of the sky." Debris from the balloon - which China described as a weather monitoring device - has scattered over a 1,500m by 1,500m size area. This is roughly the size of 15 football pitches in length and width. US Navy divers and explosive experts recovered a large part of the debris in water off Myrtle Beach in South Carolina. It was shot down six miles from the coast line. President Biden told reporters on Tuesday White House made clear it planned to deploy air force pilots to shoot down the balloon.    "We made it clear to China what we're going to do," he said. "They understand our position. We're not going to back off. We did the right thing and it's not a question of weakening or strengthening - it's reality." Condemning the action, Vice Foreign Minister Xie Feng said: "China firmly opposes and strongly protests against this."
