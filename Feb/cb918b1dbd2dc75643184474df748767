Vladimir Putin is under pressure to score a significant victory in Ukraine as the anniversary of his war nears, with failure to do seen likely to increase tensions within the Kremlin, the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) has said. The Russian President ordered a full-scale invasion of his neighbour on February 24, 2022 - but his forces have struggled in the face of fierce resistance. The MoD’s latest tweeted bulletin said: “Russia continues to pursue several offensive axes in eastern Ukraine: Vuhledar, Kremina, and Bakhmut. “Casualties reportedly remain high, particularly in Bakhmut and Vuhledar. Specifically, the 'elite' 155th and 40th Naval Infantry Brigades have sustained very high losses in Vuhledar and are likely combat ineffective.” Russian forces were likely under increasing political pressure as the anniversary of the invasion approached, the MoD said. It continued: “It is likely that Russia will claim that Bakhmut has been captured to align with the anniversary, regardless of the reality on the ground. If Russia's spring offensive fails to achieve anything then tensions within the Russian leadership will likely increase.” THIS IS A LIVE BLOG - SCROLL DOWN FOR REGULAR UPDATES...
