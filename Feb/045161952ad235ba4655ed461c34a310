January 2023 marked the tenth anniversary of the High Income Child Benefit Charge, which has elicited thousands to foot a higher tax bill to account for 2013’s £50,000 earnings threshold rule. However, there is a way Britons can reduce the charge - or even avoid it completely, and that’s through increased pension payments. Child benefit, which is worth £21.80 per week (over £1,100 a year) for the first child and £14.45 a week (over £751 a year) for each subsequent one at present, was a universal payment to families with children until January 2013. Since then, taxpayers with adjusted income of over £50,000 a year are required to pay back some or all of their Child Benefit under the High Income Child Benefit charge. The charge only applies to the higher earner in a couple, and they have to be earning £50,000 or over. So, for example, if both partners earn £49,000, they are able to keep all of their Child Benefit, whereas a couple where one person earns above £50,000 will start to lose it. However, experts at interactive investor note that adjusted net income mean total taxable income, minus certain tax reliefs - and this includes pension contributions.

While a £50,000 annual salary is well over the national average, everyone’s circumstances are different, so it’s worth knowing your rights. “Some people might also find it a source of contention that the £50,000 threshold hasn’t risen in line with earnings, especially giving the rise to the cost of living which has put extra pressure on household budgets.” But, Mr Jobson continued: “Parents paying the High-Income Child Benefit Charge may not know that they could claw back some, if not all, of their Child Benefit through pension contributions.” According to interactive investor’s calculations, a parent earning £52,000 who is already paying five percent of their income (£2,600) into their workplace pension using a net pay scheme would automatically see their taxable income fall to £49,400.

A parent earning £53,000 paying five percent of their income (£2,650) into their workplace pension could contribute an additional £350 to their pension to bring their taxable income down to £50,000 (£2,650 minus £350).  In this scenario, parents with two children could potentially save a total of £566 in Child Benefit, with a net cost of top-up pension contribution of £198 (pension contribution £350, tax saved £86, Child Benefit saved £66). Experts at interactive investor said: “When factoring in the pension tax relief and the Child Benefit savings, the pension contribution is effectively boosted by 77 percent.” READ MORE: Lloyds issues £8,000 romance fraud warning to anyone with an account  For parents with one child, the child benefit savings would be £453 with a higher net cost of £687 in pension contributions. Here, the pension contribution is boosted by 89 percent. However, Alice Guy, personal finance expert at interactive investor, added that those with private pensions could also “save more” by making additional contributions through tax rebates. Ms Guy explained that “if you have kids and earn between £50,000 to £60,000”, a £100 private pension contribution - which becomes £125 after pension tax relief, “will save you £74 in tax”.  For parents with one child, the Child Benefit savings would be £340 with a net cost of £224 in pension contributions. Here, the pension contribution is boosted by 56 percent. Similarly, a parent earning £54,000 who is already paying five percent of their income (£2,700) to their workplace pension could contribute a further £1,300 to keep their adjusted net income at £50,000.  In that scenario, parents with two children could potentially save a total of £754 in Child Benefit with a net cost of £589 in pension contributions, and the pension contribution would be boosted by a staggering 121 percent. For parents with one child, the Child Benefit savings would be £453 with a higher net cost of £687 in pension contributions. Here, the pension contribution is boosted by 89 percent. However, Alice Guy, personal finance expert at interactive investor, added that those with private pensions could also “save more” by making additional contributions through tax rebates. Ms Guy explained that “if you have kids and earn between £50,000 to £60,000, making a pension contribution could save you 59 percent tax (40 percent tax plus 19 percent child benefit for earning between £50,000 to £60,000)."   She continued: "A £100 private pension contribution - which becomes £125 after pension tax relief - will save you £74 in tax. £25 tax relief is added automatically to your pension, another £25 is due through a tax rebate at the end of the year and you save £24 in child benefit payments. Or put another way, it only costs you £51 (£100 minus £25 tax rebate, minus £24 Child Benefit) to add £125 to your private pension. “Don’t forget that to get a tax rebate for private pension contributions you need to write to HMRC if you’re a higher rate taxpayer and you don’t do a tax return.” Many higher rate taxpayers can end up paying too much tax because only basic rate pension tax relief of 20 percent is added automatically to private pension payments. Ms Guy added: “They’ll need to claim the additional 20 percent through their tax return or by writing to HMRC.”
