A man is accused of tying up and beating a woman - who he met on a dating site - in the basement of his mum's Illinois home. The bloodied victim is believed to have temporarily escaped and entered a nearby shop where she told the cashier she was being held captive by her date. The visibly injured woman entered the East Sibley Boulevard AutoZone store and told the cashier she was being held captive by a man she met on a phone app. The cashier told police the woman had multiple cruises on her neck and arms, as well as a bloodied right hand. Her injured hand was bandaged up but was wet with blood, the store employee told investigators. The disturbing incident happened at around 5pm on Sunday in Dolton, Illinois when the captor is believed to have sent the woman into the store to make a purchase.   Shortly after the woman entered the store clearly bruised and battered, a man rushed inside and told her "that was enough,” Fox 32 Chicago reported. She was dragged out of the store and bundled into a white van - believed to have either been an SUV or minivan.  The vehicle headed west on Sibley Boulevard. Police tracked the vehicle to a home in Riverdale on Monday where it was parked outside.
