The Russian military has amassed 2,000 tanks in preparation for a fresh assault on the eastern regions of Ukraine, intelligence in Kyiv has warned. Vladimir Putin has also gathered 300,000 men for the attack which is expected to target the Donbas region, an area that has seen intense fighting.  A Ukrainian military official told the Foreign Policy news website: "We expect in the next 10 days a new, huge invasion." Reports say the Russian forces have also readied 3,950 armoured vehicles, 2,700 artillery systems, 810 soviet-era multi-launch rocket systems, 400 fighter jets, and 300 helicopters. The Ukrainian official added: "It’s much bigger than what took place in the first wave. They don’t pay attention to any casualties or losses on the [battlefield]." This comes as Russia continues to hit Ukraine's infrastructure with relentless missile strikes.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has spent recent days urging the West to arm his country with fighter jets to help fight back against the Russians. FOLLOW BELOW FOR THE LATEST UDPATES...
