The Royal Family are said to be divided over whether to welcome Prince Harry back into the fold. While King Charles is keen for the situation to "calm down" ahead of his Coronation in May, Prince William has been hurt by his unfavourable portrayal in Spare. A source close to the royal household said: "It is such a momentous occasion for Charles, and he would want his son to be at the coronation to witness it. "He would like to have Harry back in the family. If they don't sort it out, it will always be part of the King's reign and how he has left his family disjointed. "He has had a reputation as a distant parent, and it would be awful for him for that to continue." In his memoir Harry details how relationship with his older brother broke down, including alleging that Prince William physically attacked him during a fight in 2019 which lead to Harry sustaining injuries. A royal source told PEOPLE magazine that the Prince of Wales is "most upset" by the accusations. They said: "William is the one who is most upset and needs time to calm down. He has been painted as hotheaded and unsympathetic. "But I don't think he will back down â€” it's whether they can move beyond it and accept that they view things differently."
