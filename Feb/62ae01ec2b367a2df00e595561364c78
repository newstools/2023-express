Brendan Fraser, 54, was the picture of elegance as he slipped into a smart suit for an appearance ahead of the 95th Academy Awards next month. The Whale star confidently walked the red carpet after his incredible transformation following the release of his new film, The Whale, which saw him wear a 300lb fat suit. Brendan attended earlier today the 95th Annual Oscars Nominees Luncheon at The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California. The actor, who has been nominated for a Best Actor gong, chose a black suit and tie combination for the coveted event. He carefully paired the dapper suit with a pair of patent shoes in black and matching glasses.
