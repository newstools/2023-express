A main road in Birmingham has been closed off after shots were fired and left three injured. A 19-year-old caught in the shooting has been treated by paramedics and taken to hospital, while two others, also aged 19, attended hospital separately. Officers raced to the scene after receiving reports of shots being fired at around 6pm at Hamstead Road, near Handsworth Park, and remain there as enquiries continue. Traffic is being re-routed from the area as the nature of the incident remains unclear. Multiple police officers and emergency vehicles were spotted at the scene. A West Midlands Ambulance was among them, and a police helicopter was seen circling the area at around 6.30pm. None of those with gunshot wounds are thought to be facing life-threatening injuries. Officers now stand guard at the cordon, which is stopping traffic in both directions. Images depict the area locked down as the police continue enquiries into the incident. The number 16 buses were at a standstill by one of the entrances to Handsworth Park, while no traffic is being allowed from the roundabout at Handsworth Wood Road and Church Lane.
