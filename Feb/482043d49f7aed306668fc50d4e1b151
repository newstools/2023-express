Archaeologists have discovered the ancient remains of a lost palace and temple in Iraq. The significant finds were unearthed in Tello, one of the earliest known cities in the world, with the relics some 4,500 years old. It is hoped they will shed more light on the ancient race known as the Sumerians, a historically significant civilisation said to have invented writing in around 2,000 BCE. Tello, originally known as Girsu, has been ravaged by excavation since its discovery 140 years ago. This original breakthrough had revealed the existence of the Sumerian civilisation, and shed light on some of the most important pieces of ancientÂ Mesopotamian art and architecture.  The newly found temple, named Eninnu, was revered as one of the most important buildings. The excavation was part of the Girsu Project, a joint initiative co-led by the British Museum. Many tablets, below, featuring administrative records of the city have been found. Dr Hartwig Fischer, director of the British Museum, said: "While our knowledge of the Sumerian world remains limited, discovery of the lost palace and temple hold enormous potential for our understanding of this important civilisation."
