Harry Potter fans are counting down to the release of Hogwarts Legacy. The action role-playing game takes place in and around the legendary school of wizardry, where players will attend classes, explore Hogwarts and make friends, all the while battling the forces of evil. If you want to check out the game at launch, you'll be pleased to find out that Hogwarts Legacy has a February 10 release date on PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC. Better yet, Hogwarts Legacy has a midnight launch time on PlayStation and Xbox, meaning you can begin playing tonight. Unfortunately, PC users will have to wait a little longer, as Hogwarts Legacy launches at 6pm GMT UK time on Steam.
