The biggest Hollywood stars put on their most glamourous gowns yesterday as they attended the 29th Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Awards. Jamie Lee Curtis, 64, showcased her cleavage in a plunging red gown, unveiling her ample assets and toned figure. While Cate Blanchett highlighted her slim frame in a re-worked figure-hugging black gown, featuring a plunging neckline. The dress was completed with stunning lace over the bust and back, and was later revealed to have been an old Versace dress she wore on the red carpet in 2016. Other celebrity attendees include Zendaya, Jessica Chastain, Emily Blunt, Michelle Williams and Sally Field to name a few.
