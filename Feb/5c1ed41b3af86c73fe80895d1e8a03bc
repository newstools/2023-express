Sky customers have been issued a seven-week warning. The British broadcaster and telecommunications company is set to make a huge change for millions of people with a Sky account.  Broadband and TV customers will see their bills rise by an average of £67 a year starting in April. The increase marks a whopping 8.1 per cent hike, reports Birmingham Live. A Sky spokesperson said in a statement: "This is not a decision we have taken lightly. "We have tried to minimise the impact to customers with an average price increase across all our broadband and TV customers of 8.1 per cent, which is below levels of inflation again this year." Sky said it will start notifying customers from February 16, with the price change coming into effect from April. Sky broadband and home phone customers who are in contract can also leave penalty-free within 30 days of being told about the price increases.  Customers who are signed up to a Sky social tariff - which offers cheaper rates for households on benefits - will not be affected by the price increases. Sky Glass and Stream customers who are in contract also will not see their bills rise while they are still in their contract period. It comes as Martin Lewis wrote to the government urging action ahead of a "national act of harm" in April with the impending price hikes. “This cannot wait until the budget – in practice, energy firms will need to know much sooner if the planned rise isn’t happening on 1 April, or they are bound to have to communicate to customers that it is coming,” he wrote to Jeremy Hunt. “Postponing the increase is a practical and fair decision, with household energy bills already double what they were the prior winter. "Crucially, the damage to people’s pockets and mental health of another round of energy price rise is disproportionate,” he said.
