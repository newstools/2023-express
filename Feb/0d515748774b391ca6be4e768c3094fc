The world’s youngest liver ­transplant recipient defied the odds after being given just two weeks to live – and has now been made an honorary ­hospital director aged 11. Lottie Bryon-Edmond was born seven weeks premature and was ­diagnosed with neonatal hemochromatosis – a rare liver condition ­causing an excess of iron in the body. She had to be rushed into intensive care in Torbay Hospital, Devon, after her birth on July 6, 2011.  Lottie’s father Chris Bryon-Edmond, 58, and mother Julie, 51, had prepared for the worst as they were told their daughter had two weeks to live and the average waiting time for a liver donation was three months. But at just five weeks old and weighing just 4lb, Lottie defied the odds to be the youngest person to have a ­successful liver transplant. Chris, from Torquay, said: “We are ­forever grateful for Lottie’s organ donor. She turned from dark to pink after the liver ­transplant, it was a ­roaring ­success. “Nobody had ever transplanted someone who was 4lb but her health is brilliant she has gone from strength to strength.”  On the day of her operation in August 2011, her brother Daniel signed up to the donor ­register. Tragically, Daniel, 25, died after he was hit by a car three years later but saved six lives by donating his organs. Lottie, who has won medals at the transplant games, hopes to raise £10,000 to build a memorial for organ donors and their families at Torbay Hospital where she is an honorary director in recognition of her work raising awareness of organ donation. Chris said: “It will hopefully encourage families to talk about organ donation.”
