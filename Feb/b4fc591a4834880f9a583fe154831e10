Simon Cowell, 63, grinned for the cameras while keeping things casual in a black jumper and his signature aviator sunglasses. Displaying his slimmed-down frame in a pair of very baggy faded jeans, the ITV favourite teamed his casual attire with a fitted shirt. Simon has previously discussed his three stone weight loss last year. He stressed he hasn't "had a gastric band" and instead said his weight loss is down to a drastic diet change after overhauling his eating habits. Simon added that a doctor warned he'd had "the worst diet he'd ever seen," and he's "stuck" to his new regime by cutting out pies, red meat and gluten. During an interview with The Sun, he said: "No, I haven't had a gastric band! Wouldn't there be scars?"
