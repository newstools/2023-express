It’s where The Avengers went to time travel, where Janet Pym (Michelle Pfeiffer) was marooned for 30 years and where Paul Rudd’s Ant-Man rode out Armageddon. For those who had far better things to do, Michael Douglas’s Hank Pym (the original Ant-Man) provides a welcome early reminder.  It is, he says, turning slightly to the camera, “a place beyond time and space, a secret universe beneath ours”. The third feature with Ant-Man in the title provides a deep dive into this subatomic world. Sadly, it’s not nearly as interesting as it sounds. Ant-Man (Rudd), his partner The Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), his 18-year-old daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) and his in-laws (Pfeiffer and Douglas) are transported there when they stupidly gather round an experimental probe. They land in a CGI-heavy world which will remind you of Star Wars, Star Trek and maybe even Babylon 5. There are aliens (some reptilian, some a bit fish-faced, and one who looks like a stick of broccoli), a gang of plucky resistance fighters and even a cantina.  The Darth Vader figure is Kang The Conqueror (Jonathan Majors) who’s being set up as the Big Baddie for the next “phase” of Marvel movies. There are some zippy set pieces where our heroes use their size-shifting suits to bat away Kang’s brittle stormtroopers. But the plot is formulaic and the dialogue largely witless. In another seven years, I’ll probably remember this as “the Baskin-Robbins One”. I’ve no idea if there’s an official tie in but frequent, unduly prominent references leave the US ice cream chain the real conquerors of this “Quantum Realm”.
