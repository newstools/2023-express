Young men in their twenties from safe countries, making the journey via small boats from France – certainly not a war-torn country – and not only filling up our hotels at great expense to the taxpayer but also putting a strain on public services such as healthcare. There has also been significant concern over public safety. The UK has always shown itself to be a welcoming and tolerant nation and the kindness that has been shown to refugees from Ukraine, Syrian and Afghanistan demonstrates that those suggesting we are all ‘bigots’ or ‘Little Englanders’ are wide of the mark, as well as the hospitality we have extended to those moving here from Hong Kong. But people don’t like being taken for mugs or having their hospitality thrown back in their faces. This isn‘t just affecting us here in the UK either.  Aside from the major disturbances in Liverpool, we have seen riots in Ireland and there are serious concerns about extremist groups, both left and right, clashing on the issue. In Red Wall constituencies like mine, our success will be defined by whether we really have managed to ‘take back control’. Taking back control was about far more than Brexit alone. It was about taking back control of our laws, taking back control of our borders and taking back control of our streets from those who would call themselves ‘protestors’.
