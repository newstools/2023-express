However, Good Morning Britain viewers were far from happy the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were the subject of debate and complained there is "more important news" to focus on. Ranvir Singh made it clear she found the South Park episode "hard to watch" as she discussed it with Jacqui Smith, Iain Dale and Jack Royston. Ranvir commented: "I mean, it is quite hard to watch isn't it? It's tough." "Listen, I'm Team Meghan, but I still think that was funny. The poster saying 'Stop looking at us,'" Jacqui added.

"I've got to about page 60 and I just can't be bothered to go on any longer." Taking to Twitter to complain about the debate, John Ellis asked: "I thought it was a news programme?" "There is more important news in the world to talk about than Harry and Megan," Aziz Aghabi tweeted.
