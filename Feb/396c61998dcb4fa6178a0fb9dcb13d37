A woman has accused a utility company of "theft" after £30 vanished from her gas meter overnight. When Gwenie Tait discovered her top-up had vanished, she complained to energy supplier Bulb, which told her that she must have used her credit or she had a gas leak. However, an inspector allegedly visited the 50-year-old's home and confirmed there had not been a gas leak. She claims she added £30 to her account before resetting her boiler and going to bed. But when she woke up, she found just £5.73 left on her meter. Bulb has since apologised for the mix-up. It has reimbursed Gwenie and offered her a "goodwill payment".   Gwenie, from Chesterton, Staffordshire, told StokeonTrentLive: "There was no gas leak - but they were still saying the credit had been used. "I knew I hadn’t used it as the boiler wasn’t on, the pilot light wasn’t even on. I forgot to reset the little white box. "There’s an emergency £5, it pays that off first, and that then leaves me with £25. I had to pay the emergency off but it still doesn’t add up. "As soon as I realised I complained. I rang through and got cut off, rang again, 15 minutes got cut off. "I was speaking to someone and they told me to hold and I was cut off again. It was then 45 minutes waiting and I got cut off again. "Most of my money is going on my gas and I can’t afford to have it taken off me like that." A £30 top-up would normally last two days. Gwenie is now only topping up in £10 increments. She added: "£30 is a lot of money."  Bulb has since apologised to Gwenie. A Bulb spokesperson said: "We are sorry for the trouble Gwenie encountered with her meter. "The team has since been in touch with Gwenie to rectify the situation, reimburse the first £30 used to top-up, and offer a goodwill payment."
