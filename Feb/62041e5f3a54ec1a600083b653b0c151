Salma Hayek, 56, looked completely ageless as she took the centre stage at the Brit Awards 2023 in a stunning all-black leather look. The Hollywood actress slipped into a leather corset and thigh-split skirt in the same material to appear at the star-studded event. Salma’s corset featured a sweetheart neckline and mesh insert, while her mid-length skirt’s ruffle-trimmed slit put her toned legs on display. She matched the ensemble to some sky-high leather platform boots and a show-stopping sparkling statement necklace with a knot design. Salma, who chose to wear her natural dark locks in a middle part, complemented the dramatic outfit with an equally dramatic winged eye look in purple and black, which she paired with a berry lip.
