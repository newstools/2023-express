A Russian pilot has been killed after their Su-25 fighter jet crashed in the Belgorod region of Western Russia - just miles from the Ukrainian border. The pilot had just returned from a combat mission over Ukrainian skies and ejected from the aircraft, but the Russian Ministry of Defence said they did not survive. The MoD claimed the crash was due to a "technical malfunction", although it also remains unclear if the jet had been hit by a strike from Ukraine. The Valuysky district is located along the border of Ukraine's Kharkiv region. A live map of the crash indicated the plane crashed into the ground 10 miles from the border. Regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov wrote on Telegram: "A plane of the Ministry of Defence crashed in the Valuysky urban district. Now an investigation team and officials of the Ministry of Emergency Situations are working on the spot." The defence ministry said: "After completing a combat mission, a Su-25 aircraft of the Russian Aerospace Forces crashed while returning to its base airfield in the Belgorod Region. "The pilot died. According to preliminary data, the cause of the disaster was a technical malfunction." FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
