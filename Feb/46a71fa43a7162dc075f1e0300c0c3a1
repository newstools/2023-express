Stephen Burgess, 37, left his property in Paisley, Scotland, when a fire broke out in a neighbouring property. Whilst he was staying with a friend, the thieves allegedly broke into the flat in the early hours of January 20 and took the urn, apparently mistaking it for a bottle of whisky. Isobel died suddenly at the age of 56 in July 2021, the loss of her ashes has left her surviving family devasted. Speaking to the Daily Record, Isobel’s other son, Gari, said: “My mum’s ashes were sitting on Stephen’s living room shelf, it was like a shrine to her and there were photos of her everywhere “The urn had stars and a moon on it, and we think the intruders thought it was an expensive bottle of whisky because the box was shaped like a bottle tube and had a special design.” Gari added: “We are absolutely heartbroken. Our mum was everything to us and this just feels like we are re-living the nightmare of having her taken from us all over again.” When Stephen returned to his flat, he was horrified to discover his home had been trashed. As well as his Mum’s ashes, other personal items were also stolen during the raid. Gari added Stephen was now waiting to be moved to a new property as the fire burnt out many of the flats. Police confirmed they were investigating the incident.
