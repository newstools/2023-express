Alexandria Cress Borys, 26, was loading her groceries into the car when she began arguing with a woman she did not know. After the exchange ended, the stranger allegedly pulled out a gun and shot Cress Borys in the back as her children sat in the car. Irmo Police said CCTV footage from the parking lot showed Cross Borys arguing with another woman, later identified as Christina Harrison, 23. They said the incident took place around 4pm on February 14 and police officers arrived at the scene shortly after the shot was fired. Upon their arrival, they declared Cress Borys dead. The woman's two children, a two-year-old and an infant, were strapped inside the car through the altercation and witnessed their mother being shot. Harrison fled the scene after the shooting on a white Ford but turned herself in at the local police station a little over an hour later.
