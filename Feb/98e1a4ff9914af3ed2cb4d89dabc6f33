Catherine Zeta Jones's flawless visage set Twitter alight tonight as she stepped on stage at the BAFTAs to present the final award of the night, the coveted Best Picture gong. Fans were later stunned to discover her age, as they marvelled over her youthful good looks. @Mofoman360 typed: “How incredible did Catherine Zeta-Jones look She’s 53.” While @stargvirI remarked: “Catherine zeta jones the woman you are omg.” (sic) @RoyOCon51088108 said: “Watching the BAFTAS and Catherine Zeta-Jones… That’s it. That’s the tweet.” @m1lfiles added: “CATHERINE ZETA-JONES THE WOMAN THAT YOU ARE.” It comes after the Welsh Wednesday actress appeared to snub the red carpet, arriving in an elegant cleavage-baring gown, just in time to present the award at the end of the ceremony.
