 The journalist, 57, took to social media on Monday morning with a photo of Madonna, 64, at Sunday night’s award show sarcastically noting in the caption: “I thought Halloween was in October.” Piers is the latest in a string of viewers and celebrities who were distracted by the Like A Virgin singer’s appearance. Madonna showed off her youthful side as she introduced Sam Smith and Kim Petras to perform their Grammy-winning song Unholy. The singer donned an all-black ensemble featuring a floor-length skirt with a knee-high slit and black blazer. Fans on social media blasted the singer’s appearance as they deemed her “unrecognisable” and saying she had “destroyed her face” while some even said she looked like an “alien”.
