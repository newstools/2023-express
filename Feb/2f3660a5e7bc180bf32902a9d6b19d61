Strictly Come Dancing 2022 finalist Helen Skelton was a guest of THB Hotels in Lanzarote - but it wasn't her first time in paradise, as she revealed that she'd stayed with them as a paying guest on several occasions before. Helen posed by the pool in a blue gingham bikini while holding her daughter Elsie Kate close to her in her arms. The On The Farm star revealed that she is travelling with her "tribe" to meet members of her extended family. "Three adults, nine kids - what could go wrong?" she joked in view of 464,000 followers of her adventure today, adding that family time was her "priority". Helen's bikini shots were flooded with praise on Instagram from a whole host of her Strictly co-stars, as the sun-kissed star offered a glimpse into life on the Canary Islands.
