She said: "I think there is a lot of romance to [the finale], I do think it's incredibly romantic. "And there's problems along the way, there's teething problems with the wedding and we are introduced to Trixie's brother, Geoffrey, who is so much fun. "He sort of becomes the wedding planner as well, so there's a bit of a 'My Best Friend's Wedding' vibe about it. "There's a lot of calamity and fun to be had with it but of course it's Call the Midwife, so there's a flip side. "There's a downside and there's a tragedy, but there's also a very beautiful payoff and I hope people will really enjoy it, because we did." Fans will have to wait and see whether Helen was referring to Trixie's wedding or the horror car crash.
