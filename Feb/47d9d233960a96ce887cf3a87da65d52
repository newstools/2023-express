Amanda Holden, 51, looked ageless as she reclined on a chair in a sultry bedroom-inspired shoot for Valentine's Day. With the romantic occasion fast approaching, JD Williams ambassador Amanda modelled the brand's latest lingerie range. The Britain's Got Talent judge stunned her 1.9 million Instagram followers as she posed seductively in a mauve lace set. Dozens of fans gushed over her "sizzling" beauty, with many declaring Amanda deserved the ITV show's "Golden Buzzer". The Heart FM presenter captioned the snap with a cheeky reference to co-star Simon Cowell's BGT catchphrase: "#ad New lingerie from @jdwilliamsuk Itâ€™s a yes from me! #valentinesday."
