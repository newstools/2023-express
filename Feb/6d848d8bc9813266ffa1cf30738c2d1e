 From great Beatles sensation Paul McCartney to chef Gordon Ramsay, Sunday night’s Super Bowl attracted a range of different celebrities. Fans were engrossed in watching their favourite celebrities, as Gordon mingled with rapper Jay-Z and Paul gingerly clutched his binoculars in eager anticipation for the game. Cara Delevingne also hilariously echoed the thoughts of viewers as she donned a shirt declaring that the football match was interrupting Rihanna’s concert. The model also later made a risque move, flipping her shirt over her head to reveal a print of Rihanna’s face on the inside. Billie Eilish, Adele, Paul Rudd and Bradley Cooper were also in attendance at the Arizona stadium.
