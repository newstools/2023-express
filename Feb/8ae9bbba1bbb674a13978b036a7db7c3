However, teams have already hit the track to perfect their new machines with the one and only pre-season test ending over the weekend. Red Bull have set the early pace with Max Verstappen looking in commanding form over three days of running. Mercedes had a mixed test with the Silver Arrows team nursing some issues which could be a major issue for Lewis Hamilton on the eve of the new campaign. George Russell suffered a hydraulics issue which limited the teams running on Friday. The German manufacturer also appears to lack some performance compared to their front-running rivals in a major blow.
