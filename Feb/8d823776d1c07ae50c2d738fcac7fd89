The distinctive song, known for its 12-bar blues style, was later recorded by The Beatles and The Rolling Stones. Strong could have been a frontman but, being shy, disliked the attention. Together with Norman Whitfield he formed one of Motown's best co-writing partnerships and created Marvin Gaye's classic I Heard It Through The Grapevine. The pair wrote many hits for The Temptations, including Cloud Nine, Papa Was A Rolling Stone, I Wish It Would Rain, and Ball Of Confusion (That's What the World Is Today). Strong was born in West Point, Mississippi, where his father was a farm worker. The family moved to the industrial city of Detroit in search of work when Strong was five. He taught himself to play on an old piano his father bought him. He sang with his older sisters in their gospel group The Strong Sisters, touring and writing their songs from the age of 14.  He met Motown founder Berry Gordy Jr. through his sister and he was signed to Tamla in 1959. Money was recorded in an impromptu jamming session and Strong's name was removed from the co-writing royalties, causing him a substantial loss of earnings, a bitter irony considering the song's famous line "Your love don't pay my bills". Strong stayed in Detroit after Motown moved to Los Angeles and recorded independently. In 2004, he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall Of Fame. He had a stroke in 2008. He died of undisclosed causes and is survived by seven children.
