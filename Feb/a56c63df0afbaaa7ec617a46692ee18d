John Cleese says he won’t let the BBC screen the Fawlty Towers reboot because the broadcaster would not give him the “necessary freedom”. Cleese, 83, who played manic hotelier Basil Fawlty in the 1970s sitcom, has criticised comedy being cancelled and warnings attached to his former episodes. He said: “Some of it triggers from a very good idea, which is to be kind to people. “But I believe it’s become far too dominated by people who are frightened of offending people.” The star also revealed the new Fawlty Towers will be set in a “bijou hotel in the Caribbean”.
