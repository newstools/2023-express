Manchester United are moving ever closer to finding out which consortium will be successful in lodging an official takeover offer for the club as the Glazers' reign over Old Trafford nears its end. As many as four parties are believed to be at the table as the American family prepare to hand over the keys to Old Trafford after years of fan opposition, with a "soft" deadline of 10pm on Friday revealing the identity of those interested. The Raine Group - the company tasked with overseeing Chelsea's takeover in May 2022 - are once again handling the potential sale for the Red Devils and it seems the Glazers could get a figure close to their reported valuation of £6billion, having paid £790m for the club 18 years ago. It marks an exciting time for the club, who are third in the Premier League under Erik ten Hag and still in contention to win all four competitions. With the prospect of being financed by super-rich new owners, United fans can feel optimistic about their future. With potential bidders already disclosing their interest in running the club after Friday's deadline, Express Sport brings you all of the latest news regarding the prospective takeover of one of the world's biggest clubs.
