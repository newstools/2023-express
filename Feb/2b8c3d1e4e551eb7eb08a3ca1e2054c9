To combat the soaring energy prices, British households can make switches and replace expensive appliances with more energy-efficient options. When doing the laundry, using a tumble dryer is one of the most expensive household appliances to run, and according to YouGov, can guzzle over £1.20 worth of energy in just one use. Altough standard airers can work once temperatures get warmer, a heated airer is an essential investment for drying clothes in the colder months, plus it also adds heat to the room when in use. Dunelm's Heated Ladder Airer is £40 to buy, and can cost as little as 3p per hour to run, which is considerably cheaper than using a tumbe dryer. Many of Dunelm's household products are popular and sell out often, but the heated airer is currently still in stock.  Buy: Heated Ladder Airer (£40) The heated ladder airer is designed to be slimline and sleek, making it easy to move around and store away when not in use. Despite the compact design, the airer can hold up to 5kg of washing, which is ideal for couples or two-person households. Featuring six heated bars, the device can be used to dry clothes and underwear, or even used to warm towels when getting out of the shower. The dryer is not only energy-efficient but also dries clothes quicker than a regular airer, without taking up too much space in the home. Shoppers have been leaving the reviews on the product, with some calling it 'the best small airer'. Jo said: ''Works great for drying towels after a shower, gets nice & hot. Great buy!'' Collyn commented: ''It is probably the best small airer. Ideal for towels.'' Liz also added: ''Very good, does the job and heats my hallway at the same time. This one is cheaper to run than the larger one.''
