 The 90s legend revived the Cher fervor as she reprised her role almost three decades later for a Rakuten Super Bowl advert. As teasers whip fans into a frenzy, the full advert is set to air during the 2023 Super Bowl taking place on February 12. Fans were stunned not just by the star’s return, but her ageless appearance, with one questioning on YouTube: “She looks so young still! Wow. Is this AI deep fake or is that really her face?” (sic) Alicia, 46, starred as Cher Horowitz alongside Stacey Dash, who played Dionne Davenport, in the classic flick that rocketed them both to stardom. In the decades since Clueless, both Alicia and Stacey have largely retreated from Hollywood, opting for some different careers. Alicia still makes some guest appearances but has also became a published author, while Stacey embarked on a career with Fox News and filed to run for congress in 2018, although she later withdrew from the race.
