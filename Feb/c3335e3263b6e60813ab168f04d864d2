Just a few months ago Henry Cavill announced he will reprise his much-loved incarnation of Superman on the big screen. The 39-year-old hunk made a cameo appearance in the end credits scene of Black Adam and shared on social media just how excited he was to be back. However, new DC Studios boss James Gunn is taking the Man of Steel in another direction and tragically the star had to break the bad news to his fans. A new actor will be playing Kal-El in 2025’s Superman: Legacy – which isn’t an origin story – and there are some hot contenders at the bookies. According to Ladbrokes: “Is it a bird? Is it a plane? It's David Corenswet, if the latest betting figures are anything to go by.” The 29-year-old TV star, who is the current frontrunner in the odds, is best known for Ryan Murphy’s Netflix series The Politician and Hollywood. He’s been the subject of Superman fan art over the last few months and has previously said he’d love to replace Cavill. Speaking previously with Entertainment Weekly, Corenswet said: “It came to my attention before the internet got a hold of me. But my pie-in-the-sky ambition is definitely to play Superman. I would love to see somebody do an upbeat, throwback [take on Superman]. I love the Henry Cavill dark and gritty take, but I would love to see the next one be very bright and optimistic.” His odds of 6-4 beat other hot contenders to play the Man of Steel, with Miles Teller and Austin Butler just behind him on 6-1. Here are the other odds for the next Superman.
