Judges have been accused of putting innocent lives at risk after the number of knife-carrying thugs dodging jail hit a high. Despite a two-strikes policy meant to put repeat offenders behind bars, 532 with two or more convictions have instead escaped with a suspended sentence, community term or just a caution. Frontline police say instead of protecting the public, judges constantly give chances to “potential killers”. Ministry of Justice (MoJ) figures show that in 2020, the number of repeat offenders escaping immediate custody fell to 351. But in 2021 it soared to 513 and jumped to 532 last year. Meanwhile, the MoJ faces a shortage of prison cells. Under emergency plans, forces in the North and West Midlands have been told prisoners can be held in their custody suites. Officers say anyone caught carrying a knife should be treated like a would-be killer. They believe the vast majority would then face automatic custodial sentences. Rich Cooke, of West Midlands Police Federation, said: “They should be receiving the mandatory six-month sentence for the first offence, not the second. “The courts and judiciary have an antipathy to minimum sentences. They are overriding the protection of innocent life, giving dangerous criminals second, third and fourth chances. “These are criminals who are armed to do serious harm. They are potential killers.” Ex-gang member Gary Williams, of Wolverhampton, got life over a gangland stabbing – and backs tougher sentences. He said: “In today’s society, the majority of people caught with a knife are not going to prison, so they are not fearful of being caught with them. The deterrent for carrying a knife isn’t strong enough.” The MoJ said: “Recent changes to sentencing mean repeat knife offenders are now more likely to face jail.” A Home Office pilot gives police in Merseyside, Thames Valley, Sussex and West Midlands the authority to stop and search knife offenders without a reason for up to two years after their convictions.
