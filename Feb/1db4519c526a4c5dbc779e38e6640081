Hundreds of cars have been wrongly flashed by a faulty speed camera on a busy road. Some drivers reported being flashed multiple times by the camera in Salford, Greater Manchester. Frustrated and concerned, drivers took to Facebook to share how they had been affected by the troublesome speed camera on Monday night and Tuesday morning. As the Manchester Evening News reports, one person wrote: "Got me about 20 times last night stopped at lights... be fuming if I get a ticket." "It's always playing up," commented a second. Another added: "Got me 10 times this morning on for a ban me thinks." "I'm going to have to take a risk coming home," someone else joked, before someone added that it was only 'making sure it earned its keep'. Transport for Greater Manchester has since confirmed that the camera had not been working properly and was fixed later on Tuesday morning (February 21), while drivers who were flashed incorrectly will not face prosecution. A spokesperson for Safer Roads Greater Manchester, which maintains the safety cameras on behalf of local authorities, said: “Safety camera faults happen occasionally can lead to the camera flashing in an uncontrolled manner as shown in this video. "The maintenance contractor attended the camera on at around 11am on Tuesday, January 21 and the issue was resolved shortly after. "All images from the cameras are manually viewed and checked before any offence is issued, and Greater Manchester Police have been made aware of this fault.”
