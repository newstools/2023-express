Mr Sambrook, originally from Yorkshire, is believed to have planned to walk and wild camp in the area and intended to climb Buachaille Etive Mor. Mr Sambrook was expected to arrive home on Tuesday, but did return and has not made contact with any family or friends. His car, a black Peugeot 208, was later found in the Three Sisters car park. He is described by police as 5ft 8in tall, of medium build, with ash blonde hair, ginger/blonde stubble, and blue eyes. Police say he has a West Yorkshire accent. When he went missing he was believed to be wearing black and khaki Merrell hiking boots and black and khaki outdoor trousers. He was also wearing a dark and light blue hooded Peter Storm jacket, and a grey North Face beanie. Furthermore, Mr was believed to be carrying a grey and yellow Merrell backpack with a green two-person tent. His dog, Bane, is a medium-sized beagle with white and brown markings on their back. A spokesman for Police Scotland said: "If you believe you may have seen Kyle and/or his dog whilst walking in the hills, or in the area since Saturday, please contact police on 101. Please also check dashcam footage if you have been in this area since Saturday."
