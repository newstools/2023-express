Canadian rapper Drake slapped down £335,000 on Jake Paul to beat Tommy Fury in his latest misjudged wager to take his tally of sports bets in the last few months to over $1billion worth of cryptocurrency. Drake’s taste for high-stakes bets would make even high-rolling Vegas goers squirm, with betting slips in the last year on some of the most ill-advised calls.  It’s a good thing Drake is one of the most successful musical artists in history with billions of streams online as such a veracious habit would be untenable otherwise. In just the last 12 months his stakes total an eye-watering sum and he shows no sign of settling down anytime soon. Here are all the publicly known bets he has staked on sport, what he bet on and how much he won...or lost.
