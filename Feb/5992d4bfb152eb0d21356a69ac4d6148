Cristiano Ronaldo is settling into life in Saudi Arabia and has now swapped the Four Seasons hotel for his first Middle Eastern home. He has moved his family into a lavish Ridayh pad, leaving his temporary residence at the Kingdom Tower, where he checked into after completing his Al-Nassr move in January. Ronaldo stayed in one of Saudi Arabia's tallest buildings alongside friends, family and staff. But according to the Mirror, the 38-year-old has left the 99-story tower to move into a rented property. Ronaldo is understood to be earning around Â£173million per year on his Al-Nassr contract after leaving Manchester United in November. And his new home, which he has rented rather than bought, is reportedly an exclusive compound boasting elite security and easy access to key amenities like shops, restaurants and gyms.

Ronaldo, a dad of five, welcomed his mother, Dolores Aveiro, to his new abode over the weekend, jetting her in from the eight-storey building he owns in Funchal, Madeira, where she lives with his older brother. Aveiro spent time with the five-time Ballon d'Or winner, partner Georgina Rodriguez and their children, posting a selfie with his oldest son on social media captioned: "Already with my boy." Ronaldo and Rodriguez have also been active online, showing a small glimpse of their new property by posting loved-up images on social media together and with baby daughter Bella Esmeralda.
