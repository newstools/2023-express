Stacey Dooley, 35, welcomed her first child with Strictly Come Dancing star boyfriend Kevin Clifton in January. Yesterday, she displayed her flat stomach as she posed with baby Minnie in low-slung maternity jeans and a white crop top. Fans were quick to comment on the post, questioning if the BBC presenter had even given birth, as she looked so good. One follower wrote: “Seriously have you just had a baby? Look amazing Stace.” Another commented: “Such a flat tummy after having a baby” while a third said: “How have you just had your first bloody baby?? Gorge and on point as ever!” Stacey then surprised fans further, as she shared a short clip of herself in a car today, revealing that she has already made her return to work.
