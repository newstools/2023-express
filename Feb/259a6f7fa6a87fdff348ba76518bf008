Russian leader Vladimir Putin will make a state-of-the-union address about the “current situation” in Ukraine on February 21st, the Kremlin has said. The speech will mark the one-year anniversary of Putin recognizing the “independence” of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts in eastern Ukraine. That announcement was used as a pretext to launch his full-scale invasion of Ukraine three days later, on February 24. His speech comes as the first signs of Russia’s major spring offensive appeared, with bolstered forces making marginal advances in the Luhansk region. On Friday morning, Putin also initiated a three and a half hour missile assault across Ukraine, forcing millions of Ukrainians into bomb shelters.
