Queen are famed for their live concerts, which is why the band are putting out 50 weekly episodes celebrating their iconic performances. This week’s looks back at one of the band’s greatest opening numbers, which is also the song they’ve performed live more than any other. Freddie Mercury once said of the track: “We released it after Killer Queen. And it's just a total contrast. It was just to show people we can still do rock 'n' roll, we haven't forgotten our rock 'n' roll roots. I enjoyed doing that on stage.” Have you guessed it yet? Sir Brian May wrote Now I’m Here when he was seriously ill in hospital with a duodenal ulcer during the summer of 1974. The song ended up being one of the singles on Queen’s album that year, Sheer Heart Attack, and became a live favourite performed at almost every one of the band’s concerts from 1974-86. During that record’s tour, Freddie would be seen singing “Now I’m here” on one side of the stage amidst darkness and then just a few bars later on “Now I’m there” he’d appear on the other side of the stage thanks to an identically dressed stage hand. The track has endured as an epic opener to their concerts and Sir Brian has continued to perform it solo, being joined by Def Leppard in 1992 at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert.

In fact, thanks to some clever technical trickery, the stage illusion Freddie used to do is now performed by the guitarist in these modern shows. Next week’s episode of Queen The Greatest Live is called Flash and the Hero.
