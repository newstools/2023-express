A British boy, 4, is fighting for his life in intensive care in Italy after a horse carriage hit him at a riding school during a holiday with his parents. The young boy's head smashed on the ground after the carriage, connected to a horse, collided with him at Andalo Riding Centre in Trentino, Northern Italy on Friday. He was left with several injuries while emergency services including firefighters, police and paramedics, rushed to the scene. After receiving some immediate treatment, a helicopter whizzed him off to Santa Chiara Hospital in Trento. He was then taken to a hospital in Verona, over 60 miles from Trentino, that specialises in neurosurgical operations. The boy is still in intensive care and being monitored closely by doctors at Borgo Trento Hospital in Verona. Andalo Riding Centre is based in Paganella, a popular ski resort found between the Dolomites and Lake Garda. The school offers visitors horse rides through nearby woodland. In winter, the resort also offers horse carriage rides during the holiday season. The Andalo Riding Centre is part of a large family activity park called Andalo Life, where families can enjoy camping and other activities. The centre is said to boast two large 12-seat sleighs and one 5-seat sleigh. The size of the sleigh that hit the boy is yet to be confirmed. Express.co.uk have contacted Andalo Life for comment. The Andalo Riding Centre is said to have horse riding instructors on site. We'll be bringing you the latest updates, pictures and video on this news story when available.
