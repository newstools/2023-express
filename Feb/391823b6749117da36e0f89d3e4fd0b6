A new door for the House of Lords is set to cost the British taxpayer an "eyewatering" seven-figure sum, triggering calls for the budget to be "brought under control". The cost of renovating the front door of the House of Lords' has tripled to £7 million in just a year. The refurbishment of the Peers Entrance in Parliament was expected to cost just over £2 million but that has leapt up after delays. The doorway is the main entrance used by peers when they arrive for work at the House of Lords. The Taxpayers alliance described the cost as "eye-watering". Tom Ryan, a researcher at the TaxPayers' Alliance warned: "Taxpayers will be furious about this eye-watering bill. "While Parliament will always need renovations, this bumper sum seems hard to justify. "The Parliamentary authorities should look at whether this budget can be brought under control."  Meanwhile, Lord Forsyth, the chairman of the Conservative peers' group, raised alarm about the costs saying the door is "worthy of the Gunness Book of Records". He said dozens of peers had expressed concerns about the scale of the works to him, adding that the design of the plans is also seen to be inappropriate for the building. The peer claimed he had little success when he tried to find out the official cost of the works. Lord Forsyth said it was "completely unacceptable that the Parliamentary authorities are refusing to answer parliamentary questions" about the costs. He added: "At a time of great pressure on public expenditure it is surely right for taxpayers and members of Parliament to be told what is being spent when the sums involved are so enormous. "The peers' entrance door at £7 million should surely be worthy of the Guinness Book of Records and the estimated cost has tripled in less than a year." Tory peer Lord Dobbs added: "I am very mystified by the costs. "They appear to be escalating as we breathe but nobody seems to be getting Parliament's permission."
