Manchester United's barren trophy run finally came to an end on Sunday with Erik ten Hag lifting the Carabao Cup trophy after his side beat Newcastle 2-0. Avram Glazer was in the stands, sitting alongside club legend Sir Alex Ferguson. The Glazer family are in the process of looking to sell the club after two official bids were lodged on February 17. Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Sheikh Jassim Bin Hamad Al Thani are said to have made offers in the region of Â£4.5billion, although that reportedly falls short of the Glazers' valuation. United fans have long protested for the Glazer family to sell up, but Erik ten Hag admitted after the Carabao Cup final that co-owner Avram appears "committed" to the club. "He [Avram Glazer] was really happy for the club, as our owner. He wanted to be part of it," he said. "He was in the dressing room, good he was here, showed his intentions. I don't know, I'm not involved in that process, but the way he is here you feel he is committed. But the process, what he wants, that is not for me. I lead this team, others are involved in decisions about ownership."
