Tyson Fury has confidently bet a whopping £100,000 on his younger half-brother Tommy to defeat Jake Paul in their upcoming grudge fight this weekend. Tommy will face the biggest test of his boxing career to date when he headlines a card in Saudi Arabia against his rival Paul in a highly-anticipated bout. Fury comes into the bout as the surprising underdog as Paul recently defeated mixed martial artist legends Anderson Silva and Tyron Woodley. But Fury will be the first true boxer he has ever faced. He has spoken confidently about what he's going to do when the two undefeated fighters meet on Sunday night. Older brother Tyson arrived in the country and showed up just in time for Thursday's press conference. And speaking on his fight prediction, he told iFL TV: "I’ve got one hundred racks (£100,000) on it, for an inside-the-distance stoppage. So, if he loses, I’ll lose 100 bags as well. I’ve got it at 3-1 odds." And speaking to Queensberry Promotions, Fury said: "To be here, getting paid millions of pounds on the world’s biggest stage at 23 [years old], new-born baby, Mrs [Molly-Mae Hague] – he’s got it all going on.  It's not just Fury who is confident though, with Paul offering Tommy him his entire purse if he beats him in the ring come Sunday. However, if Paul is victorious, then Fury would give his purse to Paul, something which the British fighter did not agree to at first before his father made the deal.
