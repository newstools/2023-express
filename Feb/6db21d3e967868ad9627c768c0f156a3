Vice President Kamala Harris' speech at a recent event resembled the writing of a five-year-old, according to blistering reaction from one Republican. Harris attended a Congressional Space Medal of Honor ceremony on behalf of POTUS Joe Biden on Tuesday. The event was held to honour former NASA astronauts Douglas Hurley and Robert Behnken. The duo were commended for their duties, which included a mission aboard the first astronaut-manned capsule in almost a decade. Describing their adventure, a laughing Harris said: “Which brings me to May 30, 2020. Bob and Doug returned to the Kennedy Space Center. “They suited up. They waved to their families, and they rode an elevator up nearly 20 stories. “They strapped in to their seats and waited as the tanks beneath filled with tens of thousands of gallons of fuel. “And then they launched. Yeah, they did.” Steve Guest, who serves as a special adviser to Texas Senator Ted Cruz, said: “It’s like a five-year-old wrote this.” Townhall.com, a conservative website which provides political commentary, added: “Only Kamala Harris can make a description of an astronaut’s launch seem patronising.” Harris has come under increasing pressure from fellow Democrats in recent weeks over whether she should remain as Joe Biden’s running-mate.
