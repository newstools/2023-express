However, there has been a petition made by free speech campaigners calling for Jeremy Clarkson not to be sacked as a presenter. The 62-year-old has since been pictured in public for the first time following the backlash he faced over comments made about Meghan. Jeremy was seen arriving in Manchester and heading into the studios to film the latest series of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? The ITV host appeared to be in good spirits as he sported a full grey beard as the presenter exited his car and headed into the studio. The presenter turned farmer sported a pair of denim jeans that he teamed with a checked shirt and casual shoes. He completed his attire with a navy blue jacket as he held a newspaper in one hand and a brown satchel in the other.
