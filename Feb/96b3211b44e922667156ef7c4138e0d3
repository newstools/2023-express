A rescue dog is marking the heartbreaking milestone of a whole year in kennels on Valentine's Day. Ella, a German Shepherd cross who is almost three years old, came into the care of Blue Cross on February 14, 2022. But a year later, she is still waiting for a home to call her own. Ella has spent much of her life in kennels through no fault of her own and was very nervous when she arrived at the charity's Southampton rehoming centre. She had lots to catch up on but has "come on leaps and bounds". And Blue Cross has now launched an appeal this Valentine's Day to find Ella a loving forever home. Ella is looking for owners who will have "patience and experience" to help her "blossom further". She is also very clever and energetic so will need someone who is keen to continue her training. In return, the charity said she will make a "wonderful companion". Kirsty Smith, rehoming supervisor at Blue Cross's Southampton branch, said: “Ella builds a strong build with her owner and absolutely loves training. “She’s never had a home to call her own but here in the office with us she’s come on leaps and bounds from the nervous dog that arrived in our care and will make someone a wonderful companion. “We’d love to find her a pawfect match this Valentine’s Day, she deserves a home to call her own and a loving family who can carry on with her training. “She’s very intelligent and quick to learn so someone with an interest and knowledge of training would be great, she loves agility too. “She has so much potential to blossom further in a home where they have the time, patience and experience for this beautiful girl.” Blue Cross is looking for a home where Ella will be the only pet and with no children. She will also need to be walked in quiet areas away from other dogs as she can get worried by them. Find out more about Ella here.
