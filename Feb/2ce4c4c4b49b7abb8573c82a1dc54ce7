The Los Angeles Lakers are set to trade Russell Westbrook in a mega deal which will see them acquire D'Angelo Russell and finally give LeBron James some help on offense. The Lakers have struggled this season and are expected to make a move before the trade deadline. Many thought that move would be made over the weekend after Kyrie Irving requested a move away from the Brooklyn Nets. However, the Lakers were unable to convince the Nets to do business with them, and the All-Star guard ended up being sent to the Dallas Mavericks instead. After they missed out on Irving, James admitted he was disappointed, indicating he wanted the franchise to make some moves before the deadline. Now, it seems he will get his wish, with Shams Charania of The Athletic reporting the Lakers are in talks with the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Utah Jazz over a deal to effectively swap Russell and Westbrook. According to Charania, the Lakers would send Westbrook and draft compensation - a first round pick most likely - to the Utah Jazz, who will send Mike Conley Jr to the Timberwolves. Then, the Timberwolves would send Russell to Los Angeles. The Lakers have struggled on three-point shooting this season, but Russell is effective from range and has shot 39.1% this season so far. That trade will likely please James, who on Tuesday told ESPN: "Definitely disappointed, I can't sit here and say I'm not disappointed at not being able to pick up such a talent, someone I had great chemistry with, who I know I have chemistry with, who can help you win championships. "We had an opportunity, our name was out there, we had an opportunity, it didn't happen, we move on and try to finish the season strong and get a bid into the postseason where I feel if we go in healthy, we can compete with anybody."
