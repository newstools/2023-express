The Home Secretary is not the only one to be on a so-called “resignation watch list” as Rishi Sunak closes in on a deal with the EU which could be the most high-stakes gamble of his political career to date. But perhaps people are forgetting that his previous high-stakes gamble came in 2016 when he turned down David Cameron and immediate career advancement to support Leave in the Brexit referendum.  Mr Sunak may be a pragmatic Brexiteer but he is nevertheless a Brexiteer. Ms Braverman is of course on the more hardline side. She resigned from Theresa May’s government over attempted compromises and was one of the Brexit Spartans to hold out against that deal in 2018. It is her friends in the European Research Group (ERG) of Tory Brexiteers who vowed to stick with the hardline unionists in the DUP and will not accept a deal which cements Brussels rule in Northern Ireland. The issue though Mr Sunak has got is that the deal - since he took control of the talks from Foreign Secretary James Cleverly - is no longer just about Brexit, relations with the EU and America (because of Biden’s unhelpful interference), or even Northern Ireland and the integrity of the UK. This has become a Conservative Party issue and a question of his leadership of it and continued tenure in Downing Street. If his gamble pays off and he can get an acceptable deal which the DUP signs off on, avoids ministerial resignations and gets through Parliament with Tory backing he will be safe as Prime Minister until the election. If though there is a massive Tory rebellion, the DUP are up in arms and he needs Labour votes to force it through then he is in trouble. Already there are mutterings about his planned tax rises in next month’s Budget, the potential of humiliation in the local elections and Labour’s 22-point lead in the polls. It means that this week is truly make or break for Mr Sunak. The stakes could not be higher.
