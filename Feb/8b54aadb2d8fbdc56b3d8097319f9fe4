Manchester City star Rodri has revealed what was said during a heated discussion between himself, Ilkay Gundogan and Erling Haaland during their victory over Aston Villa. City closed the gap with league leaders Arsenal to just three points on Sunday with a 3-1 win at the Etihad Stadium, creating the perfect storyline for Wednesday’s clash between the two sides. Rodri opened the scoring for City early in the first half when he thundered his header past Emiliano Martinez. Gundogan was then on hand to double his side’s lead in the 39th minute with a simple tap-in after Haaland latched on to a loose pass. Drama then unfolded on the cusp of halftime after Jack Grealish had won a penalty against his former side. Rodri, Riyad Mahrez and Haaland had all stepped forward to take the spot kick, though the situation was quickly diffused by Gundogan following a heated debate amongst City’s stars.  Speaking about the incident to Sky Sports, Rodri explained: “It was clear, and the captain decides, I have to accept the decision. He just said Riyad is the normal shooter, but I just asked because I was filled with confidence in that moment, but I understand and accept the decision. I don’t know [if Erling Haaland should have taken it], it depends on the coach who decides before the game, and it was Riyad. "We have good shooters even though we have been very light this season with penalties, but it is something we have to be ready to go because it can make the difference sometimes."
