Kyrie Irving and LeBron James could be reunited with the Los Angeles Lakers after the Brooklyn Nets megastar issued a trade demand on Friday night, and the former gave a hint over playing alongside 'The King' again. Irving and James formed an unstoppable duo with the Cleveland Cavaliers. Irving rocked the NBA world on Friday evening by issuing the Nets with an ultimatum - either trade him before next week's deadline or lose him in free agency this summer. The news sent the rumour wheel into overdrive, with fans speculating over where Irving could end up next. The All-Star guard was heavily linked with a move to the Lakers last summer, and is reportedly still interested in heading to the Staples Center. Speaking last week, Irving offered a massive hint over reuniting with his old Cavaliers team-mate, as he heaped praise on the 37-year-old. "I definitely saw this when we were playing together, his ability to prepare himself mentally, spiritually, emotionally, game to game, day to day," Irving said. "I've been quoted on saying it's hard to be LeBron James, or any superstar, or any entertainment, sport, athletic or business industry, because all eyes are on you. But he's handled it extremely well." "We gave the keys to the whole entire business to an 18-year-old kid and now he's 38 years old and he's still dominating.  "I don't think we should be surprised. I think we should congratulate and celebrate him as much as possible. Continue to enjoy the shows that he put on because it's not going to be for too much longer. "Whenever he decides to play [until], I'm enjoying the show. And I wish we could have gotten a chance to play against one another but who knows what can happen down the line?"
