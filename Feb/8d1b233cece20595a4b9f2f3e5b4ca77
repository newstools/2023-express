An alarm has been set off at the US Embassy in London with people inside evacuated amid an "ongoing" security alert inside. One person who was inside said he was told to "clear the area". Aro Korol posted on Twitter: "Alarm at the US Embassy in London. They told us to move far from the windows. The situation is ongoing." Kelly Betts, who was queuing in the building said on Twitter she was told to "move away" but was still unsure what was happening. Another social media user called Roshan Kar wrote: "Situation ongoing at US Embassy London. Told us to stay away from the windows…" Mr Korol shared a video of dozens of people say against a wall in the Embassy. Police dogs have been pictured patrolling the building and armed police carrying automatic assault rifles are inside talking with G4S security guards. Reports on social media have said there has been lots of "armed police shouting" although the security threat still remains unclear. A witness said the security alarm, which went off at 10.15am, was triggered because of a "suspicious package". The Met Police told Express.co.uk the incident was a "false alarm".  Scott Christy Jones, who has a friend that works at the Embassy said: "Every day there's a panic or a warning. "I called a friend who works there 10 minutes ago and she told me it was a false alarm. "Seriously, the State Department's emails are borderline funny. If they were taken seriously I doubt any American would leave their home, let alone come to Europe on a holiday." The US Embassy London stated: "The US Embassy is back to normal business operations.  Local authorities investigated and cleared a suspicious package outside the Embassy.  Thanks to Met Police for your swift action, and thanks to all visitors for your cooperation and patience at this time."
