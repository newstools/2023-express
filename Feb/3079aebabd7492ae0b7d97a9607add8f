The Queen Consort has tested positive for Covid after suffering from cold symptoms, Buckingham Palace has said. She was forced to postpone a visit to the West Midlands after contracting a "seasonal illness" which was later confirmed to be coronavirus. A statement from Buckingham Palace read: "After suffering the symptoms of a cold, Her Majesty the Queen Consort has tested positive for the Covid virus. "With regret, she has therefore cancelled all her public engagements for this week and sends her sincere apologies to those who had been due to attend them." On Valentine's Day Her Majesty had planned a trip to the West Midlands to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Elmhurst Ballet School in Birmingham. It is thought the trip will be rescheduled to a later date. Camilla had planned to meet students, staff and alumni while learning more about the prestigious history of the school and the recent developments in ballet teaching it is spearheading. A ballet fan herself, Camilla became patron of the school in 2006. Over lockdown the Queen Consort revealed she took up the Silver Swan ballet workouts, a programme to help keep over 55s active during the pandemic.
