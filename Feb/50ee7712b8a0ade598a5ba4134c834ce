Michelle Andrews, HSBC UK’s Head of Buying a Home, shared why the bank is opting to help homeowners in this way. She explained: “Providing customers with more options for the length of a fixed rate mortgage will help provide certainty on how much their mortgage will cost over two, three, five or 10 years. “They will know what their monthly mortgage payments will be, plus it gives them greater flexibility on finding a mortgage option that suits their budget. “We are also providing higher cashback, of up to £750 for first time buyers, which might be particularly welcome to cover some costs relating to their move or to help them put their own stamp on their new home.”
