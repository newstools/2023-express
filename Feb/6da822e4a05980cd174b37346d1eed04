Winter Love Island 2023 premiered two and a half weeks ago, but the ninth series of the ITV2 show, and the second winter version, has failed to compare to previous seasons, with ratings the lowest for the show’s launch in five years. So do you think it should be cancelled? Vote in our poll. The South African villa has welcomed a new bunch of young singletons on the search for love, yet just 1.2 million viewers watched the launch show. ITV bossed said streaming means the total figure amounts to 3.4 million. Despite the lower ratings, the voice of Love Island Iain Stirling said the couples were the “least settled” in the show’s history and has told fans to expect “carnage” as the series continues. He told Roman Kemp on Capital FM: “I genuinely think at the minute there is not a man in Love Island this year who wouldn't be swayed by Casa Amor as things stand.” READ MORE: Love Island stars forced to dump islander after 'intense' rows He continued: “And they're all like, every day it’s like, well, it's only been two weeks. I can literally see them, next year, being like, well we've only been together a year so we're just still open to just get to know one another.” Presenter and DJ Maya Jama took over hosting duties for the first time following Laura Whitmore’s decision to step down in August. If the series runs for the usual eight-week period, the final could air in early March. So what do YOU think? Should Love Island be cancelled?
