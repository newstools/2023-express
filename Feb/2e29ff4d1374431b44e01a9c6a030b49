The multiple claims lobbed against the Firm by Meghan Markle and Prince Harry - and in particular in the Duke's memoir Spare - have had the "unintended consequence" of showing the more relatable side of the Royal Family, according to a royal commentator. Journalist Camilla Tominey acknowledged the episodes recounted by Harry in his book, which sold more than 3.2 million copies worldwide in its first week on the shelves, did have an impact on how Firm members are seen by Britons. But, she suggested, it wasn't necessarily a devastating blow. She wrote in the Telegraph: "Yet while the Duke and Duchess of Sussexes’ popularity has nosedived in the UK since they first started washing the family linen on Oprah Winfrey’s primetime laundrette, in the wake of 'Megxit' the public appears to find the royals even more relatable. Yes – William and Kate’s reputations took a bit of a kicking with tales of hormonal disagreements and fights over dog bowls. But one unintended consequence of Harry’s memoir has been to make his nearest and dearest appear, as the late Queen once put it, as 'like all the best families' with its 'share of eccentricities, of impetuous and wayward youngsters, and of disagreements'."
