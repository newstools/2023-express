The verbal feud between Nick Kyrgios and Stefanos Tsitsipas has ignited again after the Australian goaded his rival about the "lesson" he gave him in Wimbledon in 2022. The pair had a volatile third round clash at SW19, with the Canberra man prevailing in four sets, eventually going on to reach the final where he lost to Novak Djokovic. But all the talk afterwards was about the pair's antics, which saw both of them slapped with fines. Tsitsipas was fined £8,200, while Kyrgios was hit with a £3,300 bill, after he demanded the Greek player be defaulted for hitting the ball into the crowd and also asked for a "new referee."

He appeared in a Canberra court this week and admitted to assaulting an ex-girlfriend.

I know it wasn’t OK and I’m sincerely sorry for the hurt I caused.”
