I know that when disasters happen, the British public want to know that we will actually do something to help, putting our shared humanity first. And that the Government will grip the situation, making sure that life-saving support is delivered to the right place, at pace.  So I want to reassure Express readers that is exactly what is happening. Coordination is key. We learned that from the dreadful earthquake in Haiti back in 2010, where the international response was hampered not by lack of intent, but by the fact, people were not joined up. The first thing we did when these quakes struck this week was pick up the phone â€“ to the Turkish government. We asked how we could help and what they needed. And then we swiftly assembled a team. 77 specialists and four sniffer dogs, a plane load of state-of-the-art equipment and an emergency medical team to assess the situation on the ground. Our experts are some of the best in the world and we should be rightly proud that they now have their shoulders to the wheel, supporting the international effort and saving lives.  The situation in Syria is different and highly complex, after almost 12 years of brutal conflict, which has devastated this once-thriving country. The affected area is largely ungoverned and access to millions of men, women and children is extremely difficult. Fortunately, the White Helmets, a civil protection group funded by the UK for many years, have leapt into action to help there and will continue to receive our support. More needs to be done, so we will be working with the UN and other dedicated aid agencies to try to make sure support can get to where it is needed. But make no mistake, the UK stands with the people of Turkey and Syria and will be with them in their hour of need.
