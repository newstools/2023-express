Rita Ora, 32, left fans amazed as she was photographed in a number of stunning outfits in New York City during her promo time for her new single, You Only Love Me. The singer showed off her fashion credentials in the span of just 24 hours while she stepped out for a number of events. She looked incredible in a hot pink mini dress and a matching veil, before changing into a edgy grey denim co-ord with thigh-high leather boots. Rita oozed elegance as she slipped into a red caped gown that boasted a thigh-high split, which put her incredibly toned legs on display. The pop star attended American Heart Association's Go Red For Women Red Dress Collection concert. She performed her biggest hits to help raise awareness about the impact of heart disease on women in America.
