Customers have been left distraught after a major store owned by TK Maxx announced it is closing its doors. Homesense has long been a go-to shop for bargain homeware as well as ornaments, storage solutions, home decor pieces and plants.  For years, Homesense in Arndale, Manchester, has proven popular, so it has come as a huge blow to shoppers to find it is shutting its doors for good. Signs have been put up in the store's windows stating it will shut up shop on March 1st, reports Manchester Evening News. A spokesperson confirmed that all the staff will be offered jobs in other shops nearby. There are currently Homesense stores in Altrincham and Trafford, which will remain open for business.   Speaking about the closure, a spokesperson for Homesense said: "Our Homesense Arndale Centre store will be closing on 1st March and all associates have been offered roles in nearby TK Maxx and Homesense stores. “We’re very grateful to all our customers for supporting this store and look forward to seeing them find irresistible homeware in our neighbouring Homesense store in Altrincham."  The news of the Homesense store closure has gone down badly with shoppers who couldn't hide their disappointment. Rachael Moss said: "This is my go to shop when I need to escape my brain at work and just mooch and shop." Paola Fierro said: "There will be no shops left at this rate." Lindsay Neal-Wilkinson sobbed: "Noooooo, my favourite shop!! Never miss going in when in Manchester." Sarah Turner said: "I love this shop."  Ming Yip said: "Yes noticed this today tkmaxx will be even more packed now, would have thought they need the floor space." Joanne Joyce said: "Gutted love this shop. There’s not much left in town."
