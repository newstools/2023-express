Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene said an "insane" woman and her adult son attacked her while she was at a restaurant this week. Greene said the alleged altercation happened as she was having a working lunch with members of her staff and described how she did not notice the pair before they began to address her. The Republican politician shared details of the incident on her Twitter profile, claiming the abuse was politically motivated. She wrote: "I was attacked in a restaurant tonight by an insane woman and screamed at by her adult son. "They had no respect for the restaurant or the staff or the other people dining or people like me who simply have different political views. "They are self-righteous, insane, and completely out of control." Greene said she had been working with members of her team when the mother and son duo approached their table and started shouting until "they turned into demons".

"People used to respect others even if they had different views. But not anymore. Our country is gone." But rather than sympathy, her account of the attack had drew criticism from many Twitter users who highlighted some of her controversial views. Greene also made headlines for disrupting this presidential State of the Union speech - as well as last year's.
