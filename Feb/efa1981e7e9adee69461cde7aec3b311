 Dressed in a statement red coat with an eye-catching gold brooch, beige beanie and grey gloves, 91-year-old actress Rita Moreno stayed cosy in the chilly weather. She flashed a glimpse of her black leather trousers and knee-high boots hidden under the red coat as she smiled for the photographers. Attending the Cinema Vanguard Award Ceremony, the actress met up with some A-list pals as she led a string of celebrities down the red carpet. Earlier this month, the globe-trotting acting legend was spotted in Puerto Rico for a very special performance of West Side Story, in which Rita starred in 1961.
