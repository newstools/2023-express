We'll wait and see but we've got one more season which is amazing."Touching on what Call The Midwife could explore if it were to enter the 70s, show creator Heidi Thomas confessed there are many stories to tell.She previously said: “The order of nuns on whom the Nonnatus nuns are based stay in the East End until 1976.“I think, more importantly than that single historic fact, is that of women’s lives and the lives of the working classes as well. "There are so many stories to tell, medically, socially, even emotionally, and I think we could keep on going."Call The Midwife is based on the best-selling books written by Jennifer Worth.The trilogy of novels delves into Jennifer's work as a nurse whilst lying in the poverty-stricken East End of London in the 1950s.Although some of the characters and events that unfolded in the first initial seasons were based on her memoirs, the bulk of the show is a piece of fiction by Heidi.
