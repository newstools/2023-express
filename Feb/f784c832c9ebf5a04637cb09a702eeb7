Hello Games has released another major update for space exploration game No Man's Sky. The No Man's Sky Fractal update adds new content to the game, as well as quality of life improvements across all platforms. This includes new motion controls for Nintendo Switch, as well as full virtual reality support for Sony's brand new PSVR 2 device. Hello Games explains more: "Launching together with the new PSVR2 hardware, No Manâ€™s Sky is a more immersive Virtual Reality experience than ever. "Travellers can explore the universe in up to 4K resolution, pilot ships and wield Multi-Tools with the new ergonomic Sense controllers, and benefit from a vast number of gameplay and quality of life improvements." According to the patch notes, constructing a base in Virtual Reality is more intuitive than ever, giving players the ability to select placement options based on where they look. Navigating and selecting warp destinations in the VR Galaxy Map has also been improved, with players now able to travel through the centre of the galaxy in VR. Elsewhere, the latest update introduces the Utopia Expedition, which challenges players to reconstruct the Bakkin system. "The once-affluent system of Bakkin has fallen into decay: trade routes halted, the Space Station abandoned and rotting, intelligent lifeforms departed. Anomalous solar activity prevents the crafting of items beyond the shelter of a planetary base. "Thankfully, for the good of all, the generous Utopia Foundation is coordinating a grand reconstruction project. Join the communal habitation team, settler, and help make Bakkin beautiful and productive once more!" Other upgrades include new colour grading for HDR displays, dynamic scaling on PS5, and seamless transitions between deep-space exploration and low-altitude flights.
