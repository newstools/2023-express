Braving a chill spring evening, Julia Fox, 33, shocked onlookers as she wore three belts as a shirt, barely keeping her modesty and one of which sported a Diesel logo. The Italian-American actress also sported a tiny skirt featuring pictures of mouths and teeth along with brown knee-high boots and a floor-length puffer jacket. Julia stood out with her statement red hair and bright eyeshadow, bordered by dark eyeliner and paired with a dark lip colour. The mum-of-one showed off her slim figure and abs as the actress headed to a Diesel dinner event. Julia jokingly posed alongside a statue for photographs, stretching out her lithe figure even further and risking a wardrobe malfunction.
