Madonna, 64, flaunted her incredibly smooth complexion as she took to the stage at the star-studded Grammy Awards in Los Angeles. The Like a Virgin hitmaker showcased her youthful glow as she introduced Sam Smith and Kim Petras to the stage to sing their track, Unholy. Madonna went for an all-black ensemble consisting of a black jacket along with a long, black skirt that contained a thigh-high slit on the right side. Madonna added a white blouse underneath and completed the look with a classic, black tie to pull the look together. However, many fans took to Twitter to comment on the singer's unrecognisable appearance for the awards ceremony.
