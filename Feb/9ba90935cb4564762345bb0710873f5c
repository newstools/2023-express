 The 33-year-old braved the spring chill and showed off her slender silhouette in the see-through skintight body suit on Friday evening. The Fifty Shades of Grey actress paired her daring look with a patterned mini skirt as well as knee-high boots and sheer stockings. Dakota’s sheer bodysuit was patterned with the Gucci double ‘G’ emblem and kept her modesty with a black blazer. Appearing in Milan Fashion Week’s Gucci show, Dakota happily chatted with actress Salma Hayek and her husband François-Henri Pinault as they sat in the front row. Salma also turned heads in her own attire as the Magic Mike star sported a bright blue dress, cinched at the waist to show off her curvaceous figure.
