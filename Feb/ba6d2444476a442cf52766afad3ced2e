The German-owned supermarket chain Aldi has announced plans to create 6,000 new jobs this year as its rapid expansion across the country continues. Aldi currently has 990 stores and employs around 40,000 people in Britain. It last year overtook Morrisons to become the UK’s fourth-largest supermarket chain. It said it had attracted 1.3 million new customers in the past three months.  The discount retailer will be opening new stores in towns and cities such as Norwich and Newcastle, with the doors set to open on new stores in Huddersfield and Shrewsbury within the next month. Store assistants at Aldi receive a starting pay of £11 an hour nationally, rising to £11.90, and £12.45 rising to £12.75, within the M25. The company also recently increased pay rates for around 7,000 warehouse staff, who now receive a minimum starting salary of £13.18 per hour. Aldi’s Richard Thornton said the company “prides itself” on paying well and “prioritising value”. It reported double-digit sales growth for its strong Christmas sales period as the cost-of-living crisis continued to bite. Mr Thornton added: “What we’re seeing is shoppers prioritising value like never before, we attracted 1.3 million new customers in the last three months alone.”  Aldi has been expanding and growing its market share in the UK over the past decade and said it had invested more than £700m in expansion last year. Giles Hurley, CEO of Aldi UK, said: “Demand for Aldi has never been higher as more and more people realise, they can make significant savings on every shop without compromising on quality. "It’s more important than ever that we are making it even easier for more people to shop with us – including by opening dozens of new stores. “Our success is dependent on the amazing work that colleagues do, day in and day out, and we’re looking forward to welcoming thousands more colleagues to Team Aldi throughout 2023.”
