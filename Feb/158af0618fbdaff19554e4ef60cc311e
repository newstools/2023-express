Groundhog Day has seen Punxsutawney Phil forecast six more weeks of winter. The annual tradition saw the rodent emerge at dawn in Philadelphia to make his forecast. Per tradition, if Punxsutawney Phil sees his shadow there will be six more weeks of winter. If he doesn’t, spring comes early. However, at around 7.20am, the groundhog saw his shadow, forecasting yet more cold days ahead. Despite the Express’ earlier prediction, when Phil was placed on his stage in Punxsutawney, the organisers said the rodent saw “a shadow on my stage”. Paul Pastelok, Accuweather Lead Long Range Forecaster/Senior Meteorologist, previously told Express.co.uk that after the annual tradition: “Cold February 6th and mainly dry. “High temperatures in the 20s, lows in the single digits at night. “Next storm approaches either late February 7th or on the 8th with rain or ice possible. “Temperatures overall after the 9th turning milder, similar to the early to mid-January warm up.” And in his latest forecast for the weather agency, Paul rubbished Phil’s prediction and said: “The AccuWeather long-range team is concerned about a surge of cold and wintry weather right near the official start of spring. “Before then, it may feel like spring at times, particularly across the Southeast and mid-Atlantic."
