Nile (Wilson) is a gymnast. He knows how to fall, I know how to fall now. “That’s why I got so many injuries at the start, you learn how to fall and how to be dropped.“I was afraid of dropping her at the start and I still won’t drop her, but it’s that fear of it, it could definitely happen.“I’m always having to make sure that I’m comfortable and confident with all the crazy moves I’m trying to do.”Since appearing on the ice together, there’s been speculation that Joey and Vanessa’s relationship has developed outside of the rink.
