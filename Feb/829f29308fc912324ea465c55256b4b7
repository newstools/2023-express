Sexual harassment is rife in offices and other workplaces, an MP has warned. Some 10 million people have been targeted by sex pests while doing their job in the last 12 months, an official survey found.   Of these, 1.5 million have suffered because of a third party, such as clients. Liberal Democrat MP Wera Hobhouse said: “All this lays bare the ongoing epidemic in our workplaces. For too long, women and girls have been unsafe in the workplace. “For too long, the onus for challenging sexual harassment has been on individuals. “Our current laws mean employers do not know how to respond appropriately to cases, which leaves people who have encountered traumatic experiences unsupported.” Ms Hobhouse has introduced a Bill which includes imposing a new duty on employers to “take all reasonable steps” to prevent incidents in the workplace. It has Government backing and would also make firms liable for harassment by clients or customers if it was preventable.  Ms Hobhouse said: “It will prevent harassment and protect victims and it will drive a change in the culture around victim blaming.” The Daily Express is backing calls to make public sexual harassment a criminal offence through the Keep Women Safe On Our Streets campaign. A Bill outlawing it was scrutinised by MPs this week. Kathleen Spencer Chapman, of Plan International UK, and and Gemma Tutton, of Our Streets Now, said: “It was encouraging to see all sides of the House – and the Government – continue to support this Bill, as it took its next step on the legislative journey.” However, they criticised “loopholes” that force victims to prove the perpetrator intended to cause distress or alarm. They added: “We are pleased that the Government will revisit this issue and call on them to strengthen the Bill.”
