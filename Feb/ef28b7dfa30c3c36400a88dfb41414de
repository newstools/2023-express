A mum has hit back at critics after naming her baby the same unique name as Molly-Mae Hague's newborn. Indy Clinton, 25, has been a lover of Disney's Bambi since she was a little girl, and often read the book with her first-born, Navy, two. After originally planning on naming her second child Paloma, Indy said her daughter's "sweet, curious nature" and "big brown eyes" just reminded her of the cartoon doe.  She settled on the name Bambi for their little girl, now four months old, and say it was met with surprise by friends and family. Indy said she "couldn't believe the coincidence" when Molly-Mae announced she had named her daughter Bambi on Instagram earlier this week. Indy, an influencer and fitness blogger, from Melbourne, Australia, said: "Four months ago, when I was giving birth, I was convinced Bambi was the most unique, unusual name that nobody would use. "Good on Molly-Mae though, looks like great minds think alike.  "We were set on calling her Paloma at first. That was her name, and nothing was going to change that. But I was reading the book to Navy one night and it came to me. "I sat up and yelled, 'what about Bambi?' and from then it stuck." While people have been vocal about influencer Molly-Mae's name choice on social media, Indy doesn't care if others don't like it. She said: "You know, unique names are the new trend. "Bambi is going to fit right in with the Rivers, Bears, Forests, Stormis and Wolfs. Iâ€™d be more concerned calling my kid a name from the 1900s. People will criticise anything these days, so at least give them something to talk about."

She added: "Obviously in the movie Bambi is a male, but she has the sweetest features. "The big brown eyes, the long legs - just like Bambi from the film. "She couldn't be a Paloma now - she's my Bambilicious."
