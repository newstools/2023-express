Conor McGregor has returned to the UFC for his comeback fight after flying over to Las Vegas to begin preparations for the upcoming season of The Ultimate Fighter. McGregor is set to face Michael Chandler with the two being the coaches of the new show, in what will be the Irishman's first fight in over two years. McGregor is set to move up a weight class to 170, with Chandler doing the same in what promises to be one of the more exciting fights of the year, likely to take place at the end of the summer once the show ends. And McGregor's long-time coach, John Kavanagh, also looks set to be a part of the show, posting an image on Twitter making a joke to a fan who questioned as to why he'd not be flying with McGregor to the United States on a private jet. McGregor posted an image of him in his private jet, as he prepares to fly out with his family for what looks to be the majority of the year, as he prepares for his first fight in over two years. And Kavanagh posted an image of him getting on an Aer Lingus plane from Ireland writing: "On the road again. TUF leaving home again for a couple weeks...but ya gotta do what ya gotta do." A fan responded to Kavanagh as to why he was not on the plane with McGregor, before responding with an image of his first class seats with his feet up while stating: "I'll struggle on...". Kavanagh is the long-time coach of McGregor, being a part of his mixed martial arts journey and in his corner for every single fight to date. McGregor's comeback fight will be a tough one, up against one of the more explosive fighters in Chandler - who has been involved in some crazy bouts in recent months. The two will coach The Ultimate Fighter, which is set to begin in the next few weeks, before facing each other at the end of the show - with a date not yet announced.
