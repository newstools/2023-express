A family have said their "hearts are completely broken" after a seven-year-old boy was killed in a car crash. Alfie Tollett, 7, died after a collision near a rugby club on Sunday, February 19 in Plymstock, Plymouth. Alfie was rushed to hospital, but despite the best efforts of medical staff, he died a short while later. A 55-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. Devon and Cornwall Police have released him on bail until May, reported Plymouth Live. In a heartwrenching tribute, his family said they were "numb" and were "struggling to understand why this has happened." They said: "This has to be one of the hardest things we have had to do as a family. On Sunday, our precious little Alfie was involved in a horrible incident where sadly he lost his life. This has left a massive hole in our whole family. Our Alfie was not just our son and brother, but also a grandson, a cousin, a nephew and a friend to so many people.  “He was our special cheeky, funny and precious little man. Our hearts are completely broken. We are so numb and are struggling to understand why this has happened. We would like to thank you for the kind words of support we have received." They added: “To our Alfie moos, we miss you sweetheart and we will never ever forget you. Fly high our baby. Thank you for the best seven years of our lives. All our love Mummy, Daddy, Jack and Teddy. X”
