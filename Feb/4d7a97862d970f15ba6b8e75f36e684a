Pep Guardiola 'went mad' after his side were denied a penalty in the second half of Manchester City's fixture against Nottingham Forest on Saturday before being booked by the referee. The Premier League title race is hotting up heading into the final few months of the season after City beat Arsenal to take top spot earlier this week.  The Gunners then regained the lead in the table with a dramatic 4-2 win over Aston Villa earlier on Saturday. It was potentially only for a few hours with City back in action in the 3pm kick-off slot against Forest. Despite Forest's position in the table, they've held a strong home record on their return to the Premier League with their last loss at the City Ground coming back in September. But Guardiola's side took the lead in the first half through a sensational first-time effort from Bernardo Silva just before the break. City continued to dominate the match in the second half as they pushed for a second goal. Just after the hour mark Haaland appeared to be through on goal after getting past Joe Worrall before the Forest star put a hand on the striker's shoulder.  Haaland went to ground with huge protests from the City bench for a penalty. The referee waved away the initial protests to the frustration of Guardiola, who was seen storming onto the pitch. Pat Nevin said on commentary: "Pep is going made here! They have got VAR. They will have a look at it. Calm down.  "It's not a huge argument from Erling Haaland. He is not going ballistic. It is a massive call." But Guardiola's anger only grew when VAR agreed with the match referee's decision not to award a penalty. The BBC report that Guardiola was then booked for 'manhandling the fourth official'. Just moments later and Haaland had a golden opportunity to double City's lead once again from inside the six-yard box. And they were soon made to pay for their missed chances when Chris Wood popped up in the 84th minute for his first goal since joining Forest in January.
