 General Secretary of the FBU, Matt Wrack said: "Today, firefighters were given a new pay offer. This offer is testament to the power of collective action through the Fire Brigades Union. “Last year we were offered an insulting 2%. The employers have now revised their position. “We have achieved this increase because of the massive vote in favour of strike action by firefighters and control staff across the country, which made clear the strength of feeling among firefighters about cuts to their wages."

The month before, in November, members had rejected an offer of a five percent pay increase with unions arguing this was below inflation and would be seen as a real-terms pay cut by works. While the new offer may be considered an improvement by some in the FBU, it still represents a real-terms pay cut. Firefighters have experienced a 12 percent drop in earnings since 2010. The postponement by the FBU comes as the UK experiences another wave of strike action. Train drivers, nurses, physiotherapists, civil servants, teachers, and ambulance drivers have gone on strike in recent weeks. Their main complaints have been over pay, and a real terms pay cut in recent years. This has been driven by high inflation and a rising cost of living putting a financial squeeze on many public sector workers.
