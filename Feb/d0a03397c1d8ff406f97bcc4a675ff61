Succession's Brian Cox has admitted to a soft spot for his tough TV tycoon Logan Roy and revealed his childhood was poor too, just like the character's. The veteran actor strikes a debonair pose in the current Town & Country lifestyle magazine, with a giant cigar. He says: "I have a sneaking affection for Logan. I think he's a misunderstood man." Dundee-born Brian, 76, says he put a lot into his HBO role as the head of a family media empire, even imagining an elaborate backstory: "He's not Rupert Murdoch. He's certainly not Donald Trump. He is a self-made man, but there was something in his childhood.'" Brian and his sisters struggled growing up: his father died when Brian was eight, leaving Â£10. He adds: "We were left destitute."
