Malcolm actor Stephen Hagan spoke exclusively to Express.co.uk about one of Penn's worst scenes. The first five episodes of You season four saw Joe Goldberg start a new life in London. Under the new alias of Jonathan Moore, a university professor, his main mission was to stay under the radar. However, this all changed when he fell in love with his neighbour Kate (Charlotte Ritchie), who also has a dark past. Kate was in a relationship with the insufferable Malcolm (Stephen Hagan) who wound up dead on Joe's dining table. Actor Stephen said his character's death scene was a tough moment for Joe actor Penn.
