Jennifer Lawrence, 32, narrowly avoided a wardrobe malfunction at the party, hosted by W! magazine. The Oscar-winning actress posed with the publication's editor-in-chief, Sarah Moonves, while clad in a plunging low-cut top, which left little to the imagination. Her long blonde locks cascaded down over her outfit, but couldn't disguise her braless physique at Friday's event. Jennifer showed up at the star-studded Best Performances event in Beverley Hills, California, with husband Cooke Maroney by her side. Once rated the highest paid actress in the world, the Kentucky-born legend effortlessly commanded attention.
