A builder has been killed after falling 600ft whilst climbing in Snowdonia with friends, an inquest heard. Jack Carne, 23, suffered a multitude of injuries after the rock he was standing on gave way, while he was climbing Y Gribin. Mr Carne was “extremely unfortunate” according to mountain rescuers. Mr Carne was scaling the mountain with two friends, Matthew Belcher and Brendan Smith, when the tragedy occurred, whilst the trio were en route to the summit of Glyder Fawr. Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue Team rescued Mr Belcher and Mr Smith, after they raised the alarm about the incident. Mr Carne’s body was recovered by rescuers, but due to the poor weather was not retrieved until the following day, North Wales Live reports. The young builder suffered “multiple crush injuries” according to the senior coroner for North Wales east and central John Gittins. The provisional cause of his death, at present, are the crush injuries the coroner identified.   Mr Carne’s friend Connor Lindley said: "He will be missed by many he was never not smiling, he was there for everyone whenever anyone needed him. He will be missed by everyone he ever set eyes on." Others described Mr Carne, who was from Barnsley, as a "true gentleman" and the "nicest lad you'll ever meet". A £15,000 fundraiser has been set up in his memory. The proceeds of the GoFundMe page will be used to support his family "suffering so bad at the moment due to this tragedy". A full inquest will take place later this year, the coroner has confirmed.READ MORE: Putin may have sent UFO over US airspace, exploiting Chinese balloon 'blind spot'  Snowdonia National Park is very popular with tourists across the UK, with almost 550,000 visitors last year. The park is home to multiple climbing routes up Snowdon, the most popular of which is Llanberis Path. According to SnowdonExperts.uk, Llanberis is the easiest but also the longest route up to the famous Welsh peak. Mount Snowdon’s official names were changed in November 2022, after a petition signed by more than 5,000 people called for the Welsh name to be adopted as the official title of Wales’ highest peak.

Head of the Park's cultural heritage Naomi Jones said Welsh names were part of the area's "special qualities". She added that using Welsh names would "give people from all over the world the opportunity to engage with the Welsh language and its rich culture". "We have historic names in both languages, but we are eager to consider the message we wish to convey about place names, and the role they have to play in our current cultural heritage by promoting the Welsh language as one of the National Park’s special qualities," she said.
