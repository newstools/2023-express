Twelve months on from suffering a frozen penis at the Winter Olympics, skier Remi Lindholm is a gold medal winner once again. Lindholm suffered the bizarre injury when competing at the Beijing Games last winter. The Finnish star picked up the injury - and not for the first time - whilst competing in the 50-kilometre cross-country freestyle in Beijing. The 50km event at the Winter Games had to be reduced to just 30km by officials due to the freezing conditions in China. Lindholm clearly felt the effects more than most whilst out competing, describing the pain from his frozen penis as ‘unbearable’ to Finnish outlet IL. “You can guess which body part was a little bit frozen when I finished," he added. “It was one of the worst competitions I've been in. It was just about battling through." A year on though, his frozen troubles have seemingly thawed out after securing victory in the 15km freestyle skiing championship in Tampere last month. The victory was an important one for the 25-year-old Olympian, who took to social media afterwards to describe the win as a ‘day to remember’ whilst thanking his fans. Posting on Instagram, Lindholm said: “A day to remember. “Thank you so much to everyone for the great messages, for the encouragement at the track and for living in front of the TV [in reference to his friends celebrating his win from home]." The victory was a comprehensive one for the man from Finland. He saw off his nearest rival and double sprint champion Joni Mäki, who came in to collect silver in second, 20.8 seconds behind champion Lindholm. The man who followed in third was 19-year-old Niko Anttola, who crossed the lines 34.1 seconds behind the leader.
