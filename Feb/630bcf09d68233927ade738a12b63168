Alex Scott, 38, commanded attention on Sunday night as she stepped onto the 2023 Grammy Awards red carpet just hours after flying in for the coveted event. The BBC presenter looked phenomenal in a floor-length silver gown with a ruffle-trimmed thigh slit that flaunted her toned legs. The figure-hugging dress put Alex’s curves on display, with the broadcaster smiling from ear to ear as she took the centre stage. Alex completed her sparkly look with a pair of large silver earrings and a few dainty silver rings to go with the rest of her dazzling ensemble. She opted for wearing her natural, long locks down and slicked down in a middle part, framing her features. Alex matched her eyeshadow to her dress, wearing silver and brown tones - while enhancing her cheekbones with contour.
