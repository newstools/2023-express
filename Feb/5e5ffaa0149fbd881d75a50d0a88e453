Parties interested in purchasing Manchester United from the Glazers will submit their bids before 10pm as the Raine Group's deadline nears. Qatar are considered frontrunners for the takeover but face rival interest from Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the United States and Saudi Arabia. Raine, the US merchant bank enlisted to sell the club, will begin sorting through offers once the deadline strikes as the process moves forward. Some investors seem to think the Glazers are about to complete a big-money sale of United after the club's share price in New York soared by almost 10 per cent on Wednesday. Qatari investors will be confident in winning the bidding war that could reach up to Â£6billion. And they have already drawn out a plan to redevelop Old Trafford, United's training ground and the city of Manchester. There is also understood to be interest from China and Singapore, but the primary candidates in the frame will become clear beyond the 10pm mark on Friday evening. Follow LIVE updates below...
