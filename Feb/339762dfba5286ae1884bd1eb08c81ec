She explained: “As we near the end of February, it’s important to note savers have until April 5 to make the most of this year’s tax-free ISA allowance - which is £20,000. “With this in mind, keep an eye on the latest ISA interest rates as they have become more favourable in recent months. “Paragon Triple Access ISA (Issue 12) is offering a rate of 3.1 percent and if you are prepared to lock away your savings for a year, you can take advantage of Barclays One Year Flexible Cash ISA Issue 36 which stands at four percent.” The finance expert outlined why using allowances is crucial for getting the most out of a savings account. Ms O’Brien added: “Remember, everyone has a Personal Savings Allowance, entitling a basic rate tax-payer to earn £1,000 in interest before they are taxed. “However, if you are earning more money in interest then an ISA is worth exploring for tax-free benefits.” The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is set to announce further changes to interest rates on March 23, 2023.
