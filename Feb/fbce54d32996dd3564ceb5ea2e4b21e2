Holly Willoughby wowed on the red carpet as she posed confidently for photos in a low cut, floor length gown which featured jewels embellished on the design. The This Morning presenter sported the snug attiire which accentuated her petite curves and she accessorised her look with a pair of open-toe heels. The ITV favourite sported much longer locks which were styled in loose waves as her signature blonde tresses hung loosely down her shoulders. She wore a light makeup palette which included a smokey eye, pink gloss lips and a matching blusher to accentuate her high cheekbones.
