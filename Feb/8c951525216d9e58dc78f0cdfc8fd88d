US President Joe Biden met with Polish President Andrzej Duda on Tuesday as he began a series of consultations with allies from NATO's eastern flank to prepare for an even more complicated stage of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The meeting with Duda comes hours after Vladimir Putin threatened to take the war across its current boundaries. Putin said the more international weapons are handed to Kyiv, the farther Moscow will be forced to move the "threat from our borders.  In his hour-long speech, the Russian President also accused the West of starting the war in Ukraine. He said: "I would like to repeat, they started the war and we used force in order to stop it. "I would like to emphasise when Russia tried to find a peaceful solution they were playing with the lives of people and they were playing a dirty game." Duda greeted Biden as he stepped out of his limo in a damp courtyard at the presidential palace here. The two leaders are slated to meet privately before Biden delivers a speech. Last March, the US President delivered a forceful and highly personal condemnation of Vladimir Putin at the Royal Castle just weeks after the start of the war. Biden arrived in Warsaw on Monday after paying an unannounced visit to Kyiv on a mission to solidify Western unity as both Ukraine and Russia prepare to launch spring offensives. The conflict has already left tens of thousands of people dead, devastated Ukraineâ€™s infrastructure system and damaged the global economy.
