A couple faces a £160,000 legal bill after attempting to sue their millionaire neighbours. Gary and Kerry Hambling wanted their neighbours to tear down a 6ft-high fence installed, claiming it knocked the value of their house in Polstead, Suffolk by £100,000 and blocked their access to a field. But, following a seven-year battle the judge ruled that their neighbours Garry and Jenny Waker, can keep the fence up, leaving them with the large bill, the Mail reports.  The Hambling's moved into their home four-bed £600,000 in 2015 but "friction" quickly grew about a year later when they obtained planning permission to turn a field into a car park. The Wakerlys responded by building a six-foot fencer along their driveway, blocking access to the field, so the Hamblings sued their neighbours labelling the move "monstrous" and "deliberately and unpleasantly antagonistic".     In the seven-year battle the Hamblings said the fence blocked their view and devalued their home. But a judge ruled to that the fence can stay up, saying the couple have no right to the field from their cottage.

He said: "We're the fourth family to own this house in 20 years and we should have taken that as a red flag but we didn't. There's a reason so many people have sold. "We have used the drive just as every other family have used it."   The Wakerlys also erected a 1.8m high wooden fence along the edge of their drive and one side of the Hamblings front garden, boxing them in. In a ruling in 2021, a judge ruled the fence could stay because the right of way up the track was only for the use of the field while they had its own access on the other side of the property. Challenging the decision the Hamblings argued they had a right t use their front door from the track.
