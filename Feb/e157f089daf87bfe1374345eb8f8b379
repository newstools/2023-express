Lewis Hamilton will get behind the wheel this afternoon on the final day of pre-season testing in Bahrain. The Mercedes star will hope to bounce back after a difficult afternoon yesterday as George Russell suffered a failure. The 25-year-old peeled off track with 90 minutes remaining yesterday with a hydraulic problem. This forced the Silver Arrows to hold an unplanned meeting in the paddock in a bid to get a grip on the issue. Earlier in the day, team principal Toto Wolff confirmed the team's difficult porpoising issues had been solved. Express Sport gives you the latest updates as drivers get behind the wheel for the final time ahead of next weekâ€™s crucial first race.
