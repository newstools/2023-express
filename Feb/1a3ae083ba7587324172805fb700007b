Demi Rose took to her Instagram stories and the influencer shared a candid video as she visited aesthetician, Shane Cooper, for a non-surgical beauty treatment. The 27-year-old also enjoyed a relaxing facial before she jetted out of London for Ibiza. The model could be seen laid out in the treatment room giving a glimpse of her peachy bottom as the aesthetician got to work on the "bespoke cellulite treatment". Demi said: "Hi guys. I'm back in London with my favourite Shane Cooper to do my bespoke cellulite treatment." In a follow up story, the OnlyFans model shared photos while doing yoga inside a cave in Ibiza.
