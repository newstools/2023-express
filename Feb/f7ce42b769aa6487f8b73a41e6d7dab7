But that was Betty. Commanding, forthright, and authoritative - keeping order in the chamber and we politicians in check one minute – yet offering help to the newcomer, be it an MP, staff member, or indeed, fellow Speaker, the next.  Betty was from Dewsbury in Yorkshire, while I am a proud Lancastrian - so there was always a friendly rivalry between us.  Like me, she believed in the formality of the role of Speaker and the attire that goes with it, apart from the wig which she refused to wear - a tradition I have gladly continued. She regularly offered me advice – whether I wanted it or not, but always with a twinkle in her eye! "Lovey - you’re doing very well – BUT …." she would tell me, during our many calls and meetings. It was affectionate and well-meaning direction, from one Speaker to another – and I appreciated it. On the world stage, she was an icon too. Who can forget the image of her walking hand in hand down the steps at Westminster Hall in 1996 with Nelson Mandela, then the president of South Africa? "If you were to ask me which was my finest day? That was it," she later recalled, fondly. When Betty, latterly Baroness Boothroyd, announced she was retiring as Speaker in 2000, there was an audible groan in the House. When news came through of her passing yesterday, there was widespread sorrow. The country has lost a national institution, someone who broke the mould - but for me personally, I have lost a dear friend.
