President Joe Biden set out his plans for the country, while also discussing challenges including Ukraine, inflation, China and the economy, during his second State of the Union address. He highlighted the successes his administration has made since he took office in January 2021. Here are some of the president's claims during the speech have been fact checked: Facts: Biden's comments are true. The unemployment rate was at 6.3 percent when Biden took office, in January 2021, but as of last month, the unemployment rate was 3.4 percent - the lowest rate since May 1969. Facts: Biden's claim is true. According to the US Census Bureau’s Supplemental Poverty Measure, child poverty fell from 9.7 per cent in 2020 to 5.2 percent in 2021. It is a reduction of 46 percent, which is the lowest rate since the supplemental measure began in 2009. Congress enhanced the child tax credit for one year under its American Rescue Plan Act, increasing payments to $3,600 for each child up to six years of age, and $3,000 for ages six to 17.  Facts: His claims are accurate - the African American unemployment rate was 5.4 percent in January 2023, just above the record low of 5.3 percent in August 2019. This was 9.2 percent in January 2021 - the year Biden took office. Similarly, the Hispanic or Latino unemployment rate reduced from 8.5 percent the year Biden took office, to 4.5 percent in January 2023. Facts: Joe Biden's claim is correct. Under Donald Trump's four-year administration, the national debt increased by just under $8 trillion. This was in part due to Trump's major tax cuts but also due to Covid-19 relief costs. During the Trump era, the national debt spiked in the first half of 2020 but had already been gradually increasing the three years prior that Trump was in office. Facts: President Biden's number is accurate. As many as 12.1 million jobs were created between Biden’s first full month in office, February 2021, and January 2023. The number is higher than the number of jobs created during Donald Trump's four-year presidency. However, Biden took office following the significant disruption caused by Covid-19. The pandemic caused Americans to lose 22 million jobs over two months so it could be argued that an extraordinary number of jobs were created in 2021 and 2022 because so many were lost in early 2020. However, Biden's administration claims its stimulus legislation and policies helped the country gain jobs faster than it otherwise would have. Facts: It is true that the federal deficit fell by $1.7 trillion under Biden's administration in the 2021 and 2022 financial years. However, Biden didn't mention that one of the primary reasons for this is likely because it shot up so substantially under Donald Trump in 2020 because of Covid-19 relief spending. Instead, Dan White, senior director of economic research at Moody’s Analytics, told CNN in October: "On net, the policies of the administration have increased the deficit, not reduced it.” The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget said that Biden’s actions will likely add more than $4.8 trillion to deficits from 2021 through to 2031, or $2.5 trillion not including the American Rescue Plan pandemic relief bill of 2021. But Biden has been credited for his Reduction Act, which is expected to bring down deficits by more than $200 billion over the next decade. Overall, though, the deficit reduction of that bill will likely be swamped by other bills and policies signed off by the president.

However, the president failed to mention that gas prices are significantly higher today than they were when he first took office. But gas prices often have little to do with presidential policy and are more affected by global factors, such as the war in Ukraine. According to American Automobile Association, gas prices were on average $3.457 per gallon on the day of Biden's SOTU speech, which means they were down more than $1.50 from the record-high of $5.016 in mid-June. But it was still up from a national average of $2.393 on Biden’s Inauguration Day in January 2021, according to CNN. Facts: Biden's claims contradict data from the non-profit Freedom House, which states that democracy has been in global decline over the last few years. The company said 60 countries have regressed in the previous year, while only 25 countries improved their positions.  Facts: The president's claims are true if he was comparing year-on-year growth but not if he was measuring inflation itself. Food prices were up 10.4 percent in December last year compared to the year before but have been slowly declining since hitting a 40-year high of 11.4 percent in August 2022. Overall inflation, according to the latest Consumer Prince Index report, stated that it has declined for six consecutive months since hitting a 40-year high of 9.1 percent in June 2022. Facts: President Biden's figures are correct but "good-paying" is a subjective measurement and cannot be verified by the 800,000 people who have taken up the new job positions. However, 803,000 manufacturing jobs were created under the Biden administration - during his first full month in office to January 2023, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The job growth rate during Biden’s first two years in office was 6.58 percent. The last time a comparable growth rate was higher was in 1979.
