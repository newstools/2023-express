   In a TikTok video, viewed 8.2 million times, Ms Nelson says of her role: “Me driving down the road am realising I’m 21 with a 15-year-old. “No other staff members or parents at her high school are going to take me seriously. “I can already feel people asking me what grade I’m in when I go to her events.” Ms Nelson, from Kentucky, was hit with a series of questions after the short clip went viral.     One user wrote: "You were six when you had a baby?" Another questioned: "Omg, You had a kid at six? [sic]” The 21-year-old assured her audience she "did not have a baby when I was six", but explained that she was now the main carer for her younger sister, Gracie. She said: “I recently filed for guardianship of my sister a few months ago. I felt the best way to keep my sister safe, happy, and to have all her needs and wants met was to come live with me.” READ MORE: Mykhaylo Mudryk apologises after being caught up in racism storm   Ms Nelson explained her father passed away in 2015 and her half-sister, from North Carolina, lost her mother shortly after. Realising Gracie could be put into foster care, she applied for guardianship, describing it in the video as “100 percent legal”. The TikToker also revealed that Gracie initially protested the guardianship.       “I felt like I was doing what was best for her even if it was very hard for both of us," she added. Gracie advised others: "Put the kid’s safety and pride and necessities over their emotions. “Sometimes they’re not going to be happy about it. But you just gotta do it.”
