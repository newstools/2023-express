Strictly Come Dancing's Dianne Buswell, who was partnered with presenter Tyler West for last year's competition, has been away from her beloved beau Joe Sugg while she strutted her stuff around the country. The arena tour wrapped with an explosive final show in Glasgow last Sunday, and now the delighted pro dancer has taken the time to share some of her favourite behind the scenes snaps with her followers. Uploading a carousel of waist-baring snaps, the 33-year-old chuckled: "There was a lot of mirrors on tour! (sic)." Red-haired Dianne modelled everything from rainbow coloured crochet bra tops to fishnet tights and thigh-high suede boots - and according to her 898,000 followers, she looked stunning. She wasn't short of celebrity attention, as French First Dates star Fred Sirieix marvelled: "Ooh la la!" and Will Mellor's pro dance partner Nancy Xu also hit the comments to declare her a "sister" who was "hot".
