Prince Harry and Meghan are tipped to create more television content for the world to watch. The pair, who signed a Netflix deal in 2020, are planning on creating more "light-hearted" fiction material in contrast to their "non-fiction" docuseries Meghan and Harry. The Sussexes have even been tipped to break into the rom-com market in a push to diversify their content. They are said to have several "fun" series in the pipeline, including "feel good" programmes. The royals have admitted in recent months that they love the rom-com genre with Harry revealing he used to binge-watch friends in his memoir Spare. Meghan also said she would watch Harry Met Sally "a million times" on top of "all the Julia Roberts rom coms". "There will be more of a heavy focus on fictional, scripted content," a source told the Telegraph. "It will be rom-coms, feel good and light-hearted programmes." They’re understood to be set to have executive producer roles that are less time consuming so they can spend more time on other projects. Meghan professed last year: "People love love. I’m not excluded in that sentiment. And our definition of love is really expansive: Partner love, self-love, the love of community and family."    Talking to Vanity Fair, she added: We use that as the baseline of the kind of shows and documentaries we want out there." The couple have kept quiet after the release of Spare with no public appearances until today when they were spotted celebrating the vow renewal of Ellen Degeneres and her wife, Portia De Rossi. It was the first time they had been seen since being spotted in New York for the Ripple of Hope Awards in December. It is currently uncertain whether the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will attend the King’s coronation in May, despite recent reports the King has pushed for them to come. It is said the couple haven’t received any formal contact about the event yet.
