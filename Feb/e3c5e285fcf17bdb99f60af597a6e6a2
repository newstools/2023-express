  The Say So singer wore custom Jean Paul Gaultier x Vex Clothing latex on the red carpet. The star’s shiny, black, one-shoulder dress was paired with matching gloves and featured a long train. The Kiss Me More songstress opted for a bold hair and makeup look, with a severe, short black cut, bleached eyebrows, and some large false eyelashes, which she wore over dramatic smokey eye makeup. In contrast, I’m A Mess singer was positively glowing as she posed for the cameras in her bright pink ensemble. The dress featured a halter-neck and a large cut out at the front, which exposed part of her torso and left little to the imagination. When it came to her blonde tresses, the singer opted for a glamorous blow out and finished off the look with some large hoop earrings.
