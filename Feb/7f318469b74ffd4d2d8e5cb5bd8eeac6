Two missing children, aged 11 and 12, have been found more than 1,100 miles away from home with their alleged abductor. Police in the US made the discovery during a routine vehicle tag check near a grocery store.  During the check, officers learned the owner of the vehicle was a fugitive. The children, said to be using disguised identities, were with Kristi Nicole Gilley, 36, who allegedly abducted them in March 2022. She has been described as their "non-custodial mother" by police. The trio were found near a Winn-Dixie store in High Springs in Florida, police said.
