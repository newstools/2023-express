If Virgin Media is your current Internet Service Provider (ISP) there's some bad news looming on the horizon. The telecoms firm has recently announced record price increases which will hit bills this April. Virgin will begin informing users in the coming weeks about the full extent of the hikes which will push things up by an average of 13.8 percent. That means those currently paying £60 could see things rising by around £8 per month or almost £100 a year. With the cost of living crisis already hitting pockets hard, this increase couldn't be coming at a worse time for consumers but there may be a simple way to avoid that bill shock. Community Fibre, which supplies broadband to large parts of London, has launched an exclusive deal that's targeting Virgin Media users. In fact, the offer is only available to those already signed up to Virgin's broadband and it could definitely tempt some to make the switch. The bargain broadband discount includes ludicrously fast 920Mbps speeds for just £27 per month. That's incredibly cheap with Virgin usually charging over £60 for similar Gig1 downloads. With that technology beamed into living rooms it would take just 40 seconds to download a full HD movie. YOU CAN FIND THE COMUNITY FIBRE DEAL HERE As Community Fibre is keen to point out, Virgin Media customers affected by the price increase can leave their contract without paying any early termination charge through the company's website as long as they hit the cancel button within 30 days of receiving notification of the price increase. Letters and emails are currently being sent out to anyone affected so, if your Virgin bill is going up, it's definitely worth shopping around. Even if you can't sign up for Community Fibre's service there are plenty of other deals available on the market and making the switch could save some serious money.

Speaking about its upcoming price hike, Virgin Media said: “We know that price rises are never welcome, particularly right now, but like many other businesses we are experiencing significantly increased costs while investing to keep pace with growing demand, as broadband usage rose more than 10% last year and speeds increased by 40%. We’re committed to supporting customers in this tough climate and are freezing prices for vulnerable customers including those taking our social broadband tariffs." Of course, it's not just Virgin increasing prices with other suppliers such as BT, Plusnet and EE also announcing hikes with many customers being hit by increases of over 14 percent.
