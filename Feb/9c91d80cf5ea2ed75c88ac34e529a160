April 6 marks the start of the new tax year and with most new tax years comes a raft of changes. After a significantly turbulent end to 2022 following the fallout from Liz Truss’ Government’s disastrous mini-budget, millions of taxpayers will be paying the price this year to make up for it. But what tax policies are expected and how might they affect people? Millions of households will see a stark rise in their council tax payments from April - with some Britons due to pay up to 15 percent more. Councils have been granted a new authority to raise council tax this year without holding a referendum in a bid to balance rising cost pressures and “protect” local services. Out of the 114 authorities with published budgets, 84 have opted for 4.99 percent increases including social care precepts, while a total of 38 councils have yet to put forward their tax proposals for 2023/24. Only one council has so far chosen not to raise tax, while Slough and Thurrock have Government dispensation to raise theirs by 10 percent and Croydon by 15 percent.

Once earnings exceed £50,270 a year, people pay 40 percent tax on the income above that threshold. When they earn £150,000 or more, people pay 45 percent tax on that income. From April, the 45 percent threshold will be reduced to £125,140 instead, which means those earning £150,000 or more will pay just over £1,200 more in tax every year. Commenting on the change, Sarah Coles, senior personal finance analyst at Hargeaves Lansdown, said: “The cut in the higher rate threshold from £150,000 to £125,140 means more than 200,000 more people will be dragged into the 45 percent bracket, and additional rate taxpayers will pay an average of £1,200 more. “Those on higher wages tend to have more wiggle room in their budgets, but rising prices have created headaches for top earners.

But in April, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt announced during his Autumn Statement that the Annual Exempt Amount for capital gains tax will be cut from £12,300 to £6,000, and then to £3,000 from April 2024.  He also said the dividend allowance will also be slashed. People may get dividends if they own shares in a company and if the dividends personal allowance is exceeded, a tax on those earnings will need to be paid. In April, the dividend allowance will be cut from £2,000 to £1,000 and then to £500 from April 2024. How much tax is paid on dividends above the dividend allowance depends on the person’s income tax band and currently, the rates include:
