An 85-year-old woman has died after being mauled by a 10-foot alligator while trying to save her dog. The pensioner was dragged into a pond while trying to rescue her pet from the monstrous reptile, which weighed around 700lbs. Images show alligator trappers pinning down the beast after the woman's body had been recovered from the water outside a retirement home.  The shocking incident unfolded outside the Spanish Lakes Fairways retirement community in Fort Pierce, Florida, at around noon on Monday. The alligator was tied up and carried into the back of a pickup truck by police officers and wildlife officials. Trappers found the alligator lurking at the bottom of the lake and pulled it out. Robert Lilly, the trapper on scene, told local news channel WPBF: "Snagged (the alligator) on the bottom.  “He never surfaced. He stayed down the whole time. “Got a second hook in him and then a hard line in him so we could get him up.” Lilly said it was “definitely a fight” to secure the gator as it weighed between 600 and 700 pounds.

Twenty six of these bites resulted in human deaths. FWC’s Human-Alligator Incidents Fact Sheet stated that “as more people are drawn to the water, more alligator/human interactions can occur, creating a greater potential for conflict". It adds: “But, alligators seldom bite people and fatalities from such occurrences are rare. “Over the last 10 years, Florida has averaged eight unprovoked bites per year that are serious enough to require professional medical treatment. “The frequency of these serious bites is variable but there has not been a significant trend in the past 10 years.”
