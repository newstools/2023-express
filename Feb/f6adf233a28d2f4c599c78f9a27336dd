Over the past few months, fans of the ITV soap watched Max Turner (played by Paddy Bever) fall into a life of crime after becoming part of Griff Reynolds' (Michael Condron) racist gang. In scenes set to air next week, Coronation Street viewers will watch as the teen turns his back on David Platt (Jack P Shepherd) after being sentenced. Last month, things took an unexpected turn for Max after he was arrested for incitement to attempted murder following Alya Nazir’s (Sair Khan) stabbing.During his time with Griff, the teen helped make harmful propaganda videos targeting races and religions which made Blake (Adam Little) take action.Heading to the Speed Daal to attack Maria (Samia Longchambon), Alya stepped in the way and was impaled in the stomach, resulting in a trip to the hospital.Making it clear it was Max’s videos that inspired him to carry out the stabbing, he was taken into custody with his charge increased to Encouragement of Terrorism.

The judge gives Max a six-month sentence for the crime which he will do at a juvenile detention facility.Later on, David gives Max a hug as he assures him he’ll come to visit him as often as he can, although his son has other ideas.Giving him the cold shoulder, the teen shuts him out as he asserts that he doesn’t want to be visited over the six months at all.However, it looks as though he won’t have an easy time in the secure training centre as a group of boys make it clear they’ll make his life hell.

He said: “I think it's fair to say, he will, over the course of 2023 realise the error of his ways and a lot of what we're doing after that is about him, kind of being de-programmed and unbrainwashed, I suppose."There's a redemption for him on the horizon after all of what he's been through.“It reaches its climax in the first couple of months but after effects last for a very long time after that."Coronation Street airs Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 8pm on ITV.
