Ashley Roberts, 41, knew how to make an impression as she exited the show she shares with Amanda Holden in a bright red ribbed dress by Reiss, which sets buyers back almost £200. The former Pussycat Doll appeared to have gone braless underneath the figure-hugging dress, which she paired with an £1,800 red designer bag by Italian high fashion brand Bottega Veneta. She accessorised with a pair of beige calf high boots to shield her against the cold British wind, and threw a checked print coat casually over the top. This morning, the chic radio host met country music legend Shania Twain, who was in town to promote her new album Queen Of Me. Ashley, who is originally from the sweltering city of Phoenix in Arizona but now calls the UK home, told the songstress that being in her presence was making her "fangirl so hard".
