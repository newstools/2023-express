A Primark customer was "humiliated" after claiming he was made to strip down to his boxers on the shop floor. When Craig Heilbronn, 47, noticed his own jeans had ripped, exposing his bottom in the shopping centre, he selected a new pair of trousers in Primark. After trying them on in the dressing room, he asked a store assistant if he could keep the trousers on and take the tag to the till to pay. But when he reached the cashier, Craig says he was told Primark's policy was for labels to be attached to clothes before they can be sold. It was at this point the motor trader claims he had to take the new trousers off, Stoke-on-Trent Live reports. While Primark has apologised to Craig for the "misunderstanding", the firm denies the shop worker explicitly asked him to remove the trousers. However Craig, who visited the branch in Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, on Thursday, said: "I took them off in front of everybody. There was loads of people. There was a few people laughing. Some people were recording, I could see the recording light on. I was embarrassed and upset. "They made me feel that humiliated. They should have used their common sense and used a bit of discretion. It made a situation I was already embarrassed about even worse." The shopper says he left the shop without buying the trousers and went straight to his home in Ashbourne, Derbyshire. He has since lodged a complaint with Primark. A spokesperson for the company said: "We're sorry for any misunderstanding that occurred in the store. We do require an item and its tag to be presented together at the till point, but would not expect someone to change in the queue." It comes after a female Primark customer explained how two men had walked in on her while she was getting dressed in a gender neutral changing room at a different branch last year.
