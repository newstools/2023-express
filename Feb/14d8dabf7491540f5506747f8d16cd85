A dad whose son died in the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 disaster has paid tribute to his child ahead of an emotional trip to Wembley this weekend. Barry Sweeney's son Liam, 28, had been travelling to New Zealand to see his beloved Newcastle United play in a pre-season friendly when he was killed with 297 other passengers in the tragedy. Barry is preparing to watch Newcastle play Manchester United in the side's first cup final in more than 20 years. The 61-year-old father realises the day will be tinged with sadness though as Liam never saw their beloved side at Wembley Stadium. John Alder, a fellow Magpies fan, was also on the plane shot down by Russian missile in July 2014. They will forever be remembered as two of the club's most loyal supporters, reports Chronicle Live. Barry said: "I can just see the two of them smiling down. "Liam had never been to a cup final; he would have been over the moon."     Football fans across the country were united when Liam, from Killingworth, Tyne and Wear, and John, 63, and from Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, died. And Barry, from Longbenton, Tyne and Wear, says his son would have been one of the first to get a ticket for Sunday's game. But he is now preparing for an emotional trip to London to witness the occasion his son never got the chance to see. "Liam would definitely have been there,. He was married to Newcastle United. He would have been first in the queue for tickets," Barry continued. "I'm partly doing it for Liam and John. It's always there. They will be with me on Sunday."     The odds are stacked against Newcastle United though, with Manchester United expected to win the cup for the first time in six years. Newcastle have been in impressive form in the league this season but are without a Premier League victory since January 15. The Red Devils are unbeaten in nine games in all competitions, and Marcus Rashford has scored 14 goals in 24 Premier League games so far this campaign.
