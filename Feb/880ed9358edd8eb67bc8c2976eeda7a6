Shahin Darvish-Narenjbon, 34, attacked Brenda Blainey, 87, in an act of “appalling brutality” in January 2022. She had befriended the failed asylum seeker and given him a bedroom at her home. But Darvish-Narenjbon strangled Mrs Blainey, stabbed her in the chest and sliced her throat, a court heard. The Iranian national was originally charged with murder, but three consultant forensic psychiatrists concluded he has schizophrenia and his “retained responsibility” for the ­killing is “low”. He admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. Darvish-Narenjbon was sentenced to be detained indefinitely at Rampton Hospital, Notts. Mrs Blainey had let the Iranian live in her home in the picturesque North Yorkshire village of Thornton-le-Dale, also offering him the use of her study and a car. Prosecutors described the friendship as a “grandma-grandson relationship”, revealing they spoke regularly while he was away studying architecture at university in Leeds. Mrs Blainey even attended his masters degree graduation, it was said. She had originally met the student while she was on a shopping trip in Leeds. Judge Rodney Jameson said: “You killed Brenda Blainey in her own home in circumstances of appalling brutality. “I want to make it clear both to you and to the family of Brenda Blainey that this is not to say that your responsibility is extinguished – it is not.” The killer was born in Tehran before moving to the UK aged 15. His permission to remain in the country expired in 2015 and his application for asylum was unsuccessful. However, the Home Office failed to deport him. But the judge said during the hearing that due to the ongoing political situation in Iran he would not presently “be considered for deportation”. North Yorkshire Police said Mrs Blainey’s family remain too distressed to speak about the tragedy.
