Jake Paul and Tommy Fury’s long-awaited grudge match is nearly here. After two failed attempts to get it over the line in December 2021 and August 2022, both men are finalising their preparations for the hotly anticipated contest. The pair faced off in London to officially announce the fight last month before Artur Beterbiev and Anthony Yarde duked it out at the OVO Wembley Arena. However, Fury was nowhere to be seen at their launch press conference in Saudi Arabia but assures fans he will be there on fight night. The Brit was recently pictured leaving for the Middle East. The eight-round 185lb catchweight contest is set for Sunday, February 26 and will be held at the Diriyah Arena in Saudi Arabia. The undercard is set to commence at 5 pm UK time with the Paul vs Fury main event ring walks expected around 9:30 pm. Paul vs Fury will be broadcast live on BT Sport Box Office in the UK. The pay-per-view price has been set at £19.95. BT Sport’s coverage will get underway from 6:30 pm and can be live streamed via their app and website on all good internet-connected devices including mobile phones, laptops and smart TVs.

Quotes Tommy Fury told Express Sport: “To everybody that thinks this fight won’t go ahead, I mean on my part which is the only part I can speak for, I will one hundred million per cent be there in Saudi Arabia. I want to give a big shout to everybody in Saudi Arabia. I’m looking to put on a show for everyone in attendance and everybody watching around the world." Jake Paul: “I’m used to his behaviour at this point. He’s unprofessional, he’s a flake, he’s not a serious businessman, he’s not a serious fighter. I’m going to prove that, that’s why this fight is called the truth, because the truth is going to come out. He’s going to have to pay for all the times he pulled out, all the businesspeople he screwed over.”
