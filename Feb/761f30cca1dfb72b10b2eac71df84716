 The actress wowed in downtown Los Angeles as she appeared on the red carpet in a statement Versace dress. The jaw-dropping green and black number featured a daring neckline, thigh-high slit, and a flowing train with highlights of green flashing as the actress strutted. However, the fashion icon was not done for the evening as she took to the stage to present the Outstanding Motion Picture Award in an entirely different look. This time the Spiderman star appeared in a white vintage Prada two-piece, with a barely-there bralette top and floor-length skirt. The 26-year-old was nominated for the Outstanding Actress in a Drama Series award but was surpassed by 9-1-1 star Angela Bassett.
