Dame Helen Mirren, 77, donned a red and black tartan trench coat for the Shazam! Fury of the Gods photocall on Monday. The legendary actress posed up a storm at The London West Hollywood in Beverly Hills. Her mid-length coat was cinched at the waist with a matching belt and Helen accessorised with a red knot headband. Helen towered above many of her castmates in her six-inch, patent leather lace-up boots. Joining Helen at the photocall were Rachel Zegler and Lucy Liu, who play her sisters, and Zachary Levi who plays the lead character Shazam!
