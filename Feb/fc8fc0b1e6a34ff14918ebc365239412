Coleen Greenwood was conned by a fake fireman “hero” to who she lent thousands of pounds and with whom she had a child. Coleen, now 49, fell for James Scott’s web of lies when they met on a dating website in 2014. During their two-year courtship he would return to her house in Chester-le-Street, County Durham, in a fireman’s uniform, telling tales of that day’s brave rescues. He showed Coleen a thank you card that he said had been sent by a boy he rescued. He even lied about having a vasectomy, resulting in her falling pregnant with their baby boy 15 months into their relationship. But after taking up to £60,000 from Coleen and her sister for a “business venture” and twice cancelling their wedding, all the lies unravelled – and Coleen discovered “James” was in fact married, ex-soldier Greg Wilson. He had duped his wife and three sons, who lived 28 miles away. Wilson fled, but was caught by police and in April 2020 jailed for six years after pleading guilty to multiple counts of fraud. Coleen, now happily married, told BBC podcast Love-Bombed: “I lost a stone in a couple of weeks. I didn’t eat, I didn’t sleep…how do you cope?”
