Floyd Mayweather dominated Aaron Chalmers in his first outing across the pond at the O2 Arena, London. TBE was in complete control throughout as he played up to the fans in typical Mayweather fashion. However, the boxing legend was met with a muted response in the UK with the promoters struggling to shift tickets for the fight. The 20,000 capacity venue was almost completely empty at the start of the undercard and never looked to be more than half full throughout the evening. Organisers even reportedly had to sell tickets at a 20 per cent cut price in order to get bums on seats. Not quite the reception Mayweather would have hoped for. But regardless, as always, he came to entertain and entertain he did. Never truly getting out of second gear, the 46-year-old clowned and taunted Chalmers throughout as he cruised to what would have been a wide points decision if judges were working that night.
