Sam Smith, 30, turned heads as they slipped into a daring latex bodysuit that featured huge shoulder pads for a dramatic look. The Unholy singer paired the shiny black statement piece with matching gloves for an all-black look. They completed the edgy outfit with a pair of black leather boots, while accessorising with a pair of dainty pearl earrings to add a contrasting note. Sam styled their blonde frosted tips into short spikes and added a pop of shimmer with a glossy lip.
