Last week, Sam Smith’s controversial new music video I’m Not Here to Make Friends created a storm online. The singer, who identifies as non-binary and used they/them pronouns, was accused of “hyper-sexualised” depictions that “normalised pornography” for children. Now the 30-year-old’s latest content has been slammed after dressing up as a devil in a fiery horror movie-inspired stage performance of Unholy at the Grammys last night. Smith sang and danced to Unholy with Kim Petras shortly after winning the Best Pop Duo/Group performance. The controversial set piece covered in red lights and featuring strippers dancing in s cage was met with fury online. One viewer tweeted: “You don't have to be super religious to be disturbed by that Sam Smith devil-worshipping performance.” Another posted: “I know we on the right probably use the word satanic too often but this performance from Sam Smith is literally a tribute to Satan.” READ MORE: Madonna worries fans with unrecognisable appearance at Grammys 2023 One wrote: “I’m really so sick of the satanic and demonic references…even with the hypocrisy — I still wanna know WHY Nicki, Sam Smith, Lil Nas X, and so many others reference the devil.” Another tweeted: “How you go from those tributes to Sam Smith dressed as a devil? That devil-worshipping performance was trash. And it's been done so many times. I'm disappointed af.” Following the performance of Unholy, host Trevor Noah joked about how the satanic imagery and themes would probably infuriate some viewers. The comedian pretended to be on the phone with his mother saying: “No, mom, it wasn’t the actual devil... Yeah, you did warn me about Hollywood. She said she's praying for all of us.” SOURCE
