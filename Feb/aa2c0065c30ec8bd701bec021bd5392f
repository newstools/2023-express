Jon Voight, 84, has been pictured running errands in West Hollywood in a dark ensemble. The Hollywood actor appeared frail as he walked between cars in a black fleece and trousers, paired with smart brown shoes. Angelina Jolie's dad is rarely seen in public, despite being one of the most acclaimed actors of his generation. He won an Academy Award in 1978 for his Joan Fonda collaboration in Coming Home, and he was also nominated a further three times. He has also won four Golden Globes, which includes one for his riveting portrayal of gangster Mickey Donovan on Ray Donovan.
