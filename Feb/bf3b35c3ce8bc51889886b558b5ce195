Carol Vorderman, 62, sported another one of her skintight outfits as she headed to London on Tuesday morning. The age-defying TV star showed off her famous curves in a figure-hugging leather jumpsuit which was belted in the middle to highlight her tiny waist. In the Instagram caption, Carol poked fun at her messy hair saying: "Going for the 'what the hell happened to her hair' look at 6am this morning." In a separate post, the former Countdown host also quipped that she couldn't show off her full outfit because it had shrunk over the years. She laughed: "Can't show my shoes [because] this jumpsuit is so old it's shrunk and the trouser bit is halfway up my shins."
