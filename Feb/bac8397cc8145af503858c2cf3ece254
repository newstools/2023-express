Fortnite fans are getting ready for the release of update 23.50 on PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Android and PC. The final update of the current season will add new gameplay features and make countless bug fixes. Unfortunately, however, update 23.50 will be accompanied by a period of server downtime, which means you won't be able to login and play for at least a couple of hours. If you want to know when you can start logging back into Fortnite, check out the 23.50 downtime schedule below. Releasing slightly earlier than usual, Fortnite update 23.50 will be available to download from 8am GMT UK time on the morning of February 28. Matchmaking will begin to be disabled at 7.30am, while servers will be taken offline in full at 8am GMT. The news was announced by Epic Games on Twitter, alongside a sneak preview of what fans can expect from update 23.50. "3 18 1 3 11 20 8 5 3 15 4 5," reads the Epic tweet. "Downtime for 23.50 begins at 3 AM ET, with matchmaking being disabled shortly before." If it's anything like previous periods of server downtime, then downtime should end after a couple of hours, meaning the game will be back online at around 10am GMT. Express Online will keep this article updated with all the latest developments, including confirmation on when the game is back online. In terms of what fans can expect, the headline new feature of update 23.50 is the release of the Creed 3 movie crossover. Fans will almost certainly be able to purchase an Adonis Creed skin from the item shop in the coming days. Fingers crossed we'll also get a Rocky Balboa skin. Update 23.50 will also ay the foundation for the upcoming end of season event, which takes place within the next week. The numbers in Epic's teaser tweet translate to "CRACK THE CODE", which suggests some kind of code breaking element in the end of season finale.
