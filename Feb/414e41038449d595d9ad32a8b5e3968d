The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are stuck in a "limbo", a source has claimed. While the public focus is on whether Meghan and Harry will accept King Charles's invitation to attend his Coronation, the pair are said to be in the dark over whether they actually are on the guest list and which role they will play if they attend the historic event. A source described as a friend of the couple told the Telegraph Meghan and Harry are wary of making assumptions about the event. They added: "They’ll cross that bridge when they come to it. They do not have any insight. They’re in limbo." The Duke and Duchess, the publication added, won't make a decision on their attendance until an invitation lands on their doorstep in California. As previously revealed by Express.co.uk, the pair will be among the 2,000-strong crowd invited to Westminster Abbey. Those who want to attend will need to reply to the invitation by early April.
