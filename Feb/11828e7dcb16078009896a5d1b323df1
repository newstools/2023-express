The Duke and Duchess of Sussex broke their silence on the claims they were considering legal action against the US cartoon that took aim at them in one of its episodes. Royal commentator Neil Sean alleged in an article penned for Fox News the lawyers of the California-based royals were "casting an eye over the episode".A spokesperson for Meghan and Prince Harry, however, dismissed the report by simply telling Newsweek: "This is baseless and boring." The representative did not address another report, this time by the Spectator, which included sources claiming Meghan was "upset and overwhelmed" at how she and Harry had been depicted. Last week's episode of South Park - a show that over its 26 seasons has regularly made fun of celebrities, politicians and even the 2011 nuptials of the Prince and Princess of Wales - portrayed the "Prince of Canada and his wife" campaigning to protect his privacy during a "Worldwide Privacy Tour". While Harry and Meghan were not clearly named, the characters bore a physical resemblance to them and were even given similar clothes. FOLLOW THIS LIVEBLOG FOR UPDATES ON THE ROYAL FAMILY...
