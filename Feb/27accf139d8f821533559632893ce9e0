The state pension age is currently 66, after it previously stood at 60 for women and 65 for men before age equalisation. However, this is not the end of the changes as further increases to 67 and 68 have already been laid out in legislation. People are now spending a higher proportion of their adult lives in retirement than ever before, the Government has explained. Under the Pensions Act 2014, the state pension age for men and women will rise to 67 between 2026 and 2028. This Act brought the increase in the state pension age from 66 to 67 forward. However, the Act also included a different process of phased increases.
