The family of a boy who died near the area where Nicola Bulley went missing have said they "know her family's pain". Roger Jones, 16, was thrown into the River Wyre after a motorcycle accident. The crash took place only a few yards upstream from where Ms Bulley's phone was discovered in St Michael's on Wyre on the riverbank where the mother of two vanished.    It comes as the search for Ms Bulley was abruptly suspended by the professional diver in charge of the operation after he said that the mother-of-two was not in the water and dubbed the case "baffling". Specialist Group International leader Peter Faulding declared he had been "determined" to find Nicola but that he and her partner Paul Ansell, 44, were "relieved" that he hadn't. Paul was sighted on Wednesday morning in the vicinity of the Lancashire village of St. Michael's on Wyre, where Nicola was last seen, as Mr Faulding informed the worried father that "she's not here" after a third protracted day of looking. Mr Faulding said he was "baffled" after failing to find the mortgage advisor who vanished on January 27, after dropping her two daughters - aged six and nine - at school, then taking her springer spaniel Willow for a walk along the river.

Mr Faulding and his team, from rescue operation Specialist Group International, have been searching the area around the bench, the "entry point" where it is believed by police Ms Bulley fell in the water. But on the third day of his search, Mr Faulding said efforts had proved "negative".
