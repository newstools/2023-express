LeBron James made an interesting selection during the NBA All-sStar draft which made have been an indication of what he wants for the Los Angeles Lakers in the future. James was named All-Star captain for the sixth consecutive year, with the captains able to draft the players in recent seasons for their respective teams. The 24 best players in the league were made available for selection, with James first selecting Joel Embiid from the Philadelphia 76ers. And after fellow captain Giannis Antetokounmpo selected Jayson Tatum, MVP candidates Nikola Jokic and Luka Doncic were available for James to take, however, he opted to pick former Cleveland Cavaliers teammate Kyrie Irving. James has been very open on wanting to reunite with Irving, and hoped to see the Lakers to swing a trade for the superstar point guard when he asked to be moved away from the Brooklyn Nets. However, the Lakers offer did not better that of the one from the Dallas Mavericks, who he ultimately joined, alongside fellow superstar Doncic as they hope to bring Dallas it's first title since 2011.  This upcoming summer though, Irving will become a free agent and could join the Lakers for free - alongside James for the first time since 2017. Irving reportedly had interest in joining the Lakers and has spoken highly of his relationship and playing alongside James after the two won a championship together. Although the Lakers did bring in a point guard in D'Angelo Russell, it's fair to say that Irving would be a significant upgrade. The Lakers are set to have enough cap space to sign Irving, after they managed to trade away Russell Westbrook at the trade deadline who has struggled in recent years. As well as Irving, the Lakers are also expected to pursue Draymond Green from the Golden State Warriors, who is also to become a free agent.
