A devoted owner's tribute to his dog is moving people to tears. Brodie, a ten-year-old golden retriever, sadly passed away on Friday, February 17. Owners Peter and Jackie Dyer said Brodie "was the most loyal loving companion a human could ever need, he had a heart of gold". "Loved by many", the owners have left a very sweet treat for other local dogs. Announcing the heartfelt gesture, Mr and Mrs Dyer's daughter, Clare Syrett shared a photograph of her dad holding a box with a message attached. The box contains leads and multiple balls. A message attached to the box reads: "Remember Brodie. Please take a ball or two. He loved this park with all his friends. Jackie and Peter." Speaking to PlymouthLive, Mrs Dyer said: "Brodie loved his trips to Cornwall and swimming at Plymbridge. He was a very friendly dog with other dogs and people and he loved his all his family and friends. He was just a lovely boy to have around."   Mrs Dyer explained over the years, the couple never had to buy balls for Brodie and his brother Ollie, who sadly passed away last year. She added: "We didn’t have to buy balls as he found them. So now we are giving them back. "We saw loads yesterday up the park, so they have given some dogs some fun." The moving gesture has touched many people's hearts. Dozens of people said they recognised Brodie and he was a "beautiful" and "lovely" dog. One said: "Oh no so so sorry to hear this. We always had a chat in the park, bless him he will be safe over the [rainbow bridge] you are so kind leaving his balls for his friends and others to use."
