Aldi has announced it is now selling bags of food, which would have otherwise gone to waste, at a discounted rate. As part of a new partnership, the supermarket giant has joined forces with the biggest food surplus platform, Too Good To Go. It follows a successful trial in 2022 and will apply at all of Aldi's 990 UK stores. The so-called 'Magic Bags' will include food products that are almost out of date, but at a fraction of the usual retail price, In Your Area reports. They will be priced at £3.30 and contain at least £10 worth of groceries. To buy one of the bags shoppers will need to download the Too Good To Go app, search for their nearest Aldi store and then reserve a bag to collect. It is hoped the rollout will save 4,000 tonnes of food from being wasted and Aldi says it will continue to donate surplus food to local causes. Since 2019 the supermarket has donated more than 30 million meals via its successful partnership with Neighbourly. Liz Fox, corporate responsibility director at Aldi UK, said: “Rolling out our partnership with Too Good To Go is another way of allowing us to cut down on food waste, while also offering customers the opportunity to pick up our food at even lower prices. "With the rising cost of living impacting so many, Too Good To Go offers a simple and accessible way for consumers to save money and reduce waste.”   Sophie Trueman, managing director of Too Good To Go UK and Ireland, added: “We’re thrilled to be rolling out our partnership with Aldi nationally. "Having already had fantastic feedback during a successful trial period, I know our Too Good To Go community is going to jump at the chance to save Magic Bags from their local Aldi and prevent even more good food from going to waste."
