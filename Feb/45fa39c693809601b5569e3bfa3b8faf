With Spring on the way, transitional pieces are ideal for taking the wardrobe into the new season without having to break the bank.   The knitted polo is slim-fitting and perfect for layering, it could be worn with a knitted vest over the top or even as an underlayer below thicker jumpers. The high neckline is stylish and timeless, and the style is easy to elevate by accessorising with jewellery. The satin skirt features a bold floral design with a pleated structure and is in a classic midi-length which is versatile for wearing on different occasions, whether it's for the office or a party. The piece comes in UK sizes 8-18 and matches perfectly with the knitted top for Holly's outfit, however, it could also be worn with a black or light pink top to pick out the colours in the skirt. Outfits worn by Holly Willoughby can be quick to sell out, and sizes are already starting to become unavailable for the jumper, whereas most can still be bought for the skirt, but you'll need to be quick.
