Weather maps reveal that Scotland could be blanketed in snow at the end of the week. On Thursday, northern parts of the country are set to see temperatures plummet below zero.   This has caused Met Office forecasters to issue a cold weather alert as temperatures in some parts of the country are set to be colder than Iceland. A Met Office spokesperson said: “From Sunday to Tuesday will be cold, with overnight frost widespread in the south-east and the risk of freezing fog patches. “It will be rather cold compared to the average by day, with frosts possible overnight.” Weather experts said colder air from continental Europe is set to hit Britain, bringing icy conditions and overnight temperatures as low as -10C in northern areas.
