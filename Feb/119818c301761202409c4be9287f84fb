Amanda Holden wowed in a chic black dress, that was slashed to the upper thigh and featured sexy cut-out detailing. The Britain's Got Talent star shared a number of snaps and a video of her big night on Instagram, including the moment she was presented with a very unusual cake. Referring to a debate they had on their new show, pal and co-star Alan Carr had a bidet-shaped offering made. "Last night I celebrated my bday early with gorgeous friends and family," Amanda captioned her upload. "@chattyman bought me a BIDET cake. If you’ve watched Amanda and Alan’s Italian job on @bbc and @bbciplayer you will know." She also partied with Heart colleague Ashley Roberts, fellow BGT stars Alesha Dixon and Simon Cowell, his fiancee Lauren Silverman, as well as Kelly Hoppen, Angela Griffin and Lisa Faulkner.
