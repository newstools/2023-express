Princess Anne looked radiant in yellow as she stepped out in New Zealand. The Princess Royal attended a Service of Remembrance with Rt Hon Dame Cindy Kiro who is the governor-general. On February 15, 2023, the royal was pictured laying a wreath at the Hall of Memories at Pukeahu National War Memorial in Wellington. She is Colonel in Chief of the NZ Army's Royal New Zealand Corps of Signals. For the occasion, Princess Anne donned a fitted yellow coat dress which would certainly turn heads for its bright colour. The coat was very fitted, accentuating the royal's slim figure, especially as it flared out at the bottom.

The coat had a second pop of colour with navy lapels, which broke up the canary yellow. Princess Anne paired this expertly with a navy dress which just slightly peeked out over the top and at the bottom of the dress. The royal also opted for a pair of chic glove - also in navy - which appear to be satin. As for accessories, the Princess opted for a gold brooch shaped like a wreath. She paired this with all-gold jewellery, including a simple yet stylish gold chain. As is typical of the royal, she went for pearl drop earrings with a gold stud.

Her hair and makeup was very much quintessential Princess Anne. She wore her hair in her traditional stylish bouffant bun. Makeup was a classic pop of red lipstick and dewy foundation. Princess Anne often wears red lipstick despite royals tending to stick to more subtle shades.
