Specifically, the ex has accused him of conspiring to "maliciously administering, or causing to be administering poison or a noxious substance". The complainant alleges that it was some kind of date rape drug, although the specifics of the substance have not yet been given. here is no suggestion any rape or sexual offence took place. A source said: "The ex has accused him of plotting to drug them. One time after they met up they woke up with no memory of the night before. It is a very serious accusation and has only come to light recently." Laws in the Offences against The Person Act 1861 say giving drugs or causing them to be given can be punished with a five-year prison sentence. The allegation is part of a new dossier handed to officers on him.
