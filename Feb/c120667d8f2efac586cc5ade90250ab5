Liz Truss is expected to make a number of media appearances soon, having kept a low profile since becoming the shortest-lived prime minister in British history. The Tory backbencher will address a conference of global politicians in Japan on February 17, with her speech billed as centring on Beijing as a threat to Taiwan. Ms Truss’ disastrous mini-Budget of £45billion in unfunded tax cuts last September ensured her Downing Street tenure lasted just 49 days. However, her allies recently formed the Conservative Growth Group to push for her tax-cutting agenda. And her comeback may stoke divisions among Tory MPs, as many are more eager to hastily cut taxes and take a more aggressive stance on China. The Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, a campaign group that places international pressure on Beijing, is arranging the event Ms Truss will speak at. She is due to be joined by two other ex-prime ministers, Australia’s Scott Morrison and Belgium’s Guy Verhofstadt. An ally of Ms Truss said her talk will be “hawkish”, noting: “She’s expected to address Sunak’s decision to brand China a strategic competitor rather than a threat.” Mr Sunak had called China the “biggest-long term threat to Britain” in the leadership contest – but in November, he merely referred to the country as a “systemic challenge”.
