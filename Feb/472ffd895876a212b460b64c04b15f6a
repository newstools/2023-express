A man has been stabbed in a supermarket row that got "out of hand", eyewitnesses have recalled. Police were called to a local Asda in Chadderton, Manchester around 6pm on Friday with reports of a stabbing. Shoppers said the two men were "arguing among themselves" before one pulled out a machete, Manchester Evening News reports. One witness said the incident was "terrifying". They added: "I could just hear him screaming at the top of his voice. By the time they’d both gone outside, because the security had taken them outside everyone else just started screaming."   Police said the injuries sustained are not thought to be life-threatening and an investigation has been launched. They have made no arrests so far. Witnesses said the bust-up began when one said "come outside I'm going to show you what I can do" whilst jumping around at the front of the store. “The security guard came and tried to split them up but basically it was getting out of hand. He went to him, I’ll sort you out when we’re outside," the witness added. The witness recalled the moment one of the man "took a machete out" and "slashed" the other man. They said: "He just walked away and then they were there still saying things to each other.” “It was very terrifying first time witnessed it living in Oldham for over 40 years. I'm always shopping at Asda sometimes alone and at times with my young children."
