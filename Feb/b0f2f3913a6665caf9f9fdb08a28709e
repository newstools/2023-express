Richard Belzer, who is legendary for his performances on Law and Order: Special Victims Unit died today at his home in the South of France.He had been battling severe health issues, and reportedly let loose a barrage of colourful language in the moment before his death. His long-time friend Bill Scheft has now revealed his last ever sentence to the Hollywood Reporter, which was: "F**k you, motherf***er." The claim illustrates the feisty personality for which the acclaimed actor was known prior to his premature death. He was perhaps best known for his appearances on Law and Order, although those are far from the only credits to his name. The controversial actor started out as a stand-up star working the comedy circuit. However, there was a tragic history behind the way he seemed to so effortlessly embrace his skills. He alleged that his mother had been physically abusive, and that he had developed humour as a tactic to distract her from beating him. In adult life, he became a warm-up comedian to entertain the audience on Saturday Night Live, and made multiple guest appearances on the show during the 1970s. He also had minor roles in iconic movies such as Scarface, alongside Cafe Flesh, Fame and Night Shift.
