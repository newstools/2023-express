LeBron James has officially been ruled out for at least two weeks - and he could miss the rest of the season if Los Angeles Lakers fail to make the playoffs. James suffered the injury during the Lakers' comeback victory against the Dallas Mavericks. He was able to finish the game but hobbled on his right foot when seen afterwards. Losing James is a huge blow for the Lakers who have been thoroughly impressive in their last 11 games, winning seven of them after making significant changes to their roster. The Lakers were able to acquire D'Angelo Russell, Jarred Vanderbilt, Malik Beasley, Rui Hachimura and Mo Bamba and all have played their roles in the team's turnaround. But with the team still in 12th position in the western conference, three wins outside of the playoffs, losing James and still being able to be in the playoff hunt looks to be a huge ask. ESPN reporter Adrian Wojnarowski tweeted: "LeBron James’s right foot is expected to be reassessed in two weeks to see how much progress he’s made, but timeline on return expected to extend beyond that checkpoint. "Where Lakers reside in standings by then could impact how soon it makes sense for him to return." James had also posted a cryptic message on his Instagram beforehand where he posted a picture of his right leg with the caption "fkn sucks". With James out, the Lakers will look to fellow superstar Anthony Davis to step up, along with their new additions. The 38-year-old will certainly aim to come back as soon as possible, to avoid missing out on the playoffs for the second consecutive season.
