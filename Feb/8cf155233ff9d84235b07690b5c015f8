King Charles III caused a royal frenzy upon meeting mothers and their infants in the Unversity of East London's hub baby development lab in Stratford on Wednesday. The visit, which was for the campus' 125th anniversary, saw the 74-year-old meet with mothers and their infants in the lab. During the visit, one of the infants started to cry as the King sat down on the sofa. After witnessing the young child's cry, the King replied: "Oh dear." Aside from this interaction, the King later met with some schoolchildren and a young toddler in the capital. The toddler was spotted enthusiastically handing over a posy of flowers.
