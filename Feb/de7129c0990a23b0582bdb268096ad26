An evil stepmother killed her three-year-old autistic stepson after slapping him "multiple times around the head. Leila Borrington, 23, inflicted a broken skull and unsurvivable brain damage to Harvey Borrington. The defendant told a court Harvey "fell backwards" off a leather armchair to sustain the injuries.  Borrington stood trial, accused of murder, manslaughter, one count of wounding and four charges of assault. She was today found guilty of manslaughter, but cleared of murder. She has also been found guilty of inflicting GBH, cleared on three charges of assault, causing bodily harm, and found guilty of one charge of assault, causing bodily harm. The killer will be jailed at Nottingham Crown Court on March 16. Describing the findings of a post-mortem examination, Jonas Hankin KC, prosecuting, said: "He had suffered trauma to the head. "That had caused damage to the brain itself and bleeding overlying the brain." Harvey, who was largely non-verbal, suffered the injuries at home on August 7, 2021, reports Nottinghamshire Live. Borrington was also accused of five other attacks – including one in which the youngster suffered a broken arm. The woman, of Wilford, Nottingham, had denied wrongdoing.   But Borrington wiped away tears in the dock as the verdicts were read out to a hushed courtroom. Commenting on the verdict, Detective Inspector Simon Harrison, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "This was a tragic incident that shocked the local community. Harvey was a much-loved little boy who was cherished by his parents and his wider family. "As a police officer I am pleased with the decision of the jury in this case, but I acutely aware that it is of no consolation to those left behind. This has been a very lengthy and difficult investigation and I would like to thank everyone involved in getting us to this point." Borrington will be sentenced to all convictions next month.
