Aries You’re tired of having to count pennies and you just want to splash out on something nice for yourself. Extravagance, even so, can bring its own kind of punishment either causing you even more stress or making you short on cash over the days to come. Taurus You might discover you have not been a good judge of character. It’s annoying for you to have trusted someone who does not deserve your loyalty. Next time, you will be more careful about what you share with them. A colleague will be taking all the credit for your ideas and inspirations. Gemini Sadness will be connected to a close friendship when there has to be a parting of the ways. Jobs you are working on now can be enhanced by using your imagination and creative skills. Be aware of the present moment. Keep your mind in the present and this will help you appreciate what you have.                         Cancer Conversations are confusing. Everyone has a different view. Suggestions come your way from all directions and you’re wondering who to trust the most. This gives you a good reason to put off making a major decision until you have had time to think for yourself. Leo Acknowledging you can be stubborn occasionally will help you and a loved one reach a compromise. Whereas your friendships and social life improve with each passing day, a close relationship does not seem to be meeting with as much success. Virgo You may have to carefully go over another person’s contribution to a group project to improve on areas they have carelessly overlooked. Others seem less concerned about details than you and no-one seems happy no matter what you try to do for them. By the end of the day you will just want to be alone.   Libra You might wish you hadn’t taken on some family responsibilities when these are more time consuming than you had first expected. Still, you know how much your loved ones are relying on you and being held accountable for these commitments will keep you on track. Scorpio It doesn’t matter what other people might say, it is not being selfish if you concentrate on your own needs for a change, and no-one else’s. Someone has been relying on you too heavily. You might suggest they go off on their own and make their own choices and decisions. Sagittarius Conversations will touch on the mysteries of the universe, religion and spiritual matters. You won’t agree that there is truth in everything that is being said and some healthy scepticism will lead you to do some further research of your own.     Capricorn You have so much to do that you could do with more than 24 hours in a day. It will not help that you find yourself having to sort out difficulties caused by another. Ultimately, where the problem began does not matter. Instead of looking for whom to blame, look for solutions. Aquarius You’re attracted to some eccentric ideas but you won’t have the mental or physical energy to get involved in anything that is complex and complicated. A relative will have some humble news that reminds you how there is beauty if simplicity. Pisces People are banking on your practical support. You’re growing tired of being the one everyone turns to when things go wrong. You just want to lose yourself in imagination and although fantasy is your great escape, it will have to wait until another day when no one is depending on you.
