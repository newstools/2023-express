Six all-electric flights a day will connect three hospitals in largely rural Northumberland, cutting delivery times and also carbon emissions. If the four-month trial is successful, Northumbria Healthcare staff will increase the unmanned vehicles’ trips to 15 every day. The craft – which can transport a payload of more than 6lbs (3kg) – are managed by Skyports Drone Services and the project is an NHS partnership with medical drone firm Apian, developed through the health service’s Clinical Entrepreneurs Programme. The drones, which take off and land like mini-helicopters, will call at Wansbeck General Hospital in Ashington, Alnwick Infirmary and Berwick Infirmary. Project managers will assess the impact on patients, staff and the environment during the trial. Sir James Mackey, chief executive of Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, said: “Using drones has the potential to help us deliver important drugs and supplies in a better, smarter way.” The Civil Aviation Authority approved test flights from yesterday until May 12.
