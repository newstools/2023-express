Christina Applegate, 51, carried a black cane branded with 'FU [f**k you] MS', to the 29th Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Awards. The Hollywood star brought her lookalike daughter Sadie Gracie LeNoble, 12, to the awards ceremony. Christina cut a glamorous figure in a black velvet tuxedo-style gown, paired with sultry red lipstick. Sadie, who kept hold of her mother's hand, sported a black blazer, paired with a matching shirt and trousers. This comes as Christina sadly revealed that the ceremony may be her "last awards show as an actor" amid her battle with multiple sclerosis (MS).
