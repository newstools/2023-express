Russia is scrambling to boost its defences in southern Ukraine as Volodymyr Zelensky’s forces eyes a strategic breakthrough through which could offer access to Crimea. The UK Defence Ministry’s latest bulletin suggests Vladimir Putin’s forces were bolstering defensive fortifications in central Zaporizhzhia Oblast, especially near the town of Tarasivka. The statement explained: “Despite the current operational focus on central Donbas, Russia remains concerned about guarding the extremities of its extended front line.” This was demonstrated by continued construction of defensive fortifications in Zaporizhzhia and Luhansk oblasts and deployments of personnel, the MoD’s post continued. Russia’s front line in Ukraine amounted to approximately 800 miles with the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia oblast frontline at 120 miles, the Mod said. It added : “A major Ukrainian breakthrough in Zaporizhzhia would seriously challenge the viability of Russia’s ‘land bridge’ linking Russia’s Rostov region and Crimea; Ukrainian success in Luhansk would further undermine Russia’s professed war aim of ‘liberating’ the Donbas. “Deciding which of these threats to prioritise countering is likely one of the central dilemmas for Russian operational planners.”
