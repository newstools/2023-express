A German woman claiming to be Madeleine McCann has offered "evidence" on Instagram. A user with the username @iammadeleinemcann has become the latest user to offer unsubstantiated claims they are the missing girl. The woman claimed in a video that she started thinking she could be girl "a few months ago". In the live video, she told viewers she was 21 years old, but believes she could be as young as 13. She claims to have freckles and specks in the same places as the youngster, and that she wants to get a DNA test. Her Instagram bio appeals for help getting in contact with Madeleine's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann. She adds that she has attempted to contact police from the UK and Poland, who have ignored her. While unsubstantiated and unproven, the claims have attracted the attention of tens of thousands of people. She has 25,000 followers watching her further allege she is long-lost Madeleine. And her live video is now being circulated on TikTok, where users are calling for the original poster to receive "help". One repost of the video garnered 3.3 million views, with others receiving hundreds of thousands each. Madeleine McCann disappeared when she was three years old from her bed at a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz where she was staying with her family in 2007. Her whereabouts remain unknown nearly 16 years after she went missing.
