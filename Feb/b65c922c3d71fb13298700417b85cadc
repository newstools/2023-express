Davina McCall, 55, joined her fellow ITV presenter Amanda Holden, 51, in modelling JD Williams’ sizzling new lingerie range, launching just before Valentine’s Day.  The age-defying brand ambassadors put on a racy display in a sultry bedroom photoshoot, with The Masked Singer panellist Davina showing off her fit frame in a sheer red bodysuit, featuring a high neck and lace trim.  Davina clutched onto a red rose while lounging on a bed, before changing into a sexy black high-waisted lingerie set.  Amanda also wowed in the romance-inspired photoshoot, as she highlighted her endless legs in a bright red satin and lace set from the brand.  The Britain’s Got Talent judge reclined on a chair while running her manicured nails through her blonde curls. As part of its Valentine’s Day range, JD Williams is helping customers celebrate their romantic evening at home this February by giving away a free Yankee candle worth £24.99 when they spend £20 or more on lingerie or nightwear with JD Williams.
