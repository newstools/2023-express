The new Indiana Jones 5 trailer reveals that Harrison Ford’s adventurer first came across Mads Mikkelsen’s Nazi villain Jürgen Voller during World War II. Dial of Destiny is set to open with a flashback scene set during the conflict with the 80-year-old title star digitally de-aged. Indy and his ally Basil, played by Toby Jones, are on a train with the baddie and crates marked ERR – as spotted by fans who’ve decoded what it must be an acronym for. Given the World War II setting, ERR must stand for Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg which is translated as Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce. In real life, this was a Nazi organisation led by Head of Foreign Affairs Alfred Rosenberg that was dedicated to appropriating cultural property during the conflict. Hitler authorised the ERR to confiscate precious manuscripts and books from invaded nations, important artefacts of ecclesiastical authorities and Masonic lodges, all valuable cultural property belonging to Jews and, of course, art masterpieces. The Allies’ Monuments Men – the subject of the George Clooney movie of the same name – was tasked with recovering the stolen objects. So what’s this got to do with Indy?

Presumably, the Dial of Destiny – which some fans theorise is an ancient time travel device – is now the MacGuffin. Either the ERR have it in the opening, or Voller – who probably worked for the organisation during the war – is now seeking it in 1969 when most of the movie is set. If the device has the ability to travel back in time, perhaps he plans on changing history so that Hitler wins. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny hits cinemas on June 30, 2023.
