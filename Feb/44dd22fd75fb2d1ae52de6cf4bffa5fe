Aldi’s known for its wide range of Specialbuys, but one of its most loved items is its hanging egg chair. Shoppers will be delighted to know that it’s coming back just in time for spring. There’s no furniture item more loved on Aldi than the hanging egg chair which is perfect for relaxing in the warm weather. Having launched a few years ago, it continues to sell out instantly whenever its restocked and has over 2,000 glowing reviews from shoppers. Aldi is bringing the large hanging egg chair back online and it’ll be available for pre-order from Sunday February 26, 2023 onwards. It’s priced at £344.99, which makes it £155 cheaper than this one from The Range.

In addition, Aldi has also brought back its Gardenline Wildfire Fire Pit, which is £79.99 and praised by shoppers for its stunning design. Nige from Wales commented: “Great garden heat all around the area when people sit around it.” Freckles48 added: “Lovely fire pit, lovely to look at when burning wood which burns extremely well, such great value for money!” The retailer launched brand new garden furniture to its site including the Corner Sofa and Cover, which is priced at £299 and comes in light grey, dark grey and cream.
