Jennie Bond, 72, looked phenomenal as she posed for a candid swimsuit picture shared in view of her 10,200 Twitter followers. The BBC star took to the social media platform earlier today to offer her fans an insight into her holiday in Antigua while she “looked for frigate birds”. She could be seen basking in the sun wearing floral print swim wear in red, which she complemented with a wide brim hat. In a follow-up update, Jennie posed with her arms open on the beach while wearing a royal blue swimsuit. She also posted a snap while sunbathing poolside, showing only her feet and the stunning tropical landscape.
