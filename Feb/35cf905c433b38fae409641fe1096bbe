Manchester United continue to prepare for their crunch Europa League clash against Barcelona on Thursday, but the club's takeover situation still looms large in the background. Plenty is unfolding behind the scenes as the Red Devils move one day closer to a new start... or a new era under the Glazer family. On the eve of Barcelona's visit to Old Trafford, Erik ten Hag will speak to the media, where fans will hope he will provide some positive team news. Lisandro Martinez, Scott McTominay and Marcel Sabitzer are all available after missing the enthralling first leg at the Nou Camp, but Harry Maguire, Antony and Antony Martial's statuses are uncertain. Takeover talk unsurprisingly isn't going away, though, and Qatari businessman Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani is set to receive a transfer blow if he completes a takeover. FFP regulations may limit United's summer spending until sales are made, despite an expectation that new owners will splash the cash. Meanwhile, the timeline on which club officials want the Glazers' future to be decided has also been reiterated. And Ten Hag has also been spotted in a meeting that has excited all United fans after an image emerged on social media on Tuesday night. Follow LIVE updates below...
