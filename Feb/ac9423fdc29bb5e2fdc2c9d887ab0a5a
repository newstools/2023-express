Road workers have been slammed for painting "Britain's shortest set" of double yellow lines. Telecoms firm CityFibre has been installing a £52 million full-fibre network across Plymouth, Devon.  Hilarious photos show where fibre cables were installed, but only the top half of the words "LOADING BAY" were replaced, leaving the rest of the marking almost illegible. A tiny set of double yellow lines have also only been painted. The "bare minimum" repair job has been ridiculed by locals. "Haha, this is hilarious paintwork," one poster said.  Another added: "Do not worry, they will be back in a short while to dig it all up again." One said: "Maybe fix a pothole instead." "Britain's shorted double yellow lines. Farce," a fourth person said. A spokesperson for CityFibre said: "All members of our build team are given full training before they carry out these essential works, and are expected to deliver all works to high standards. "In this instance, we are investigating if any further work needs to be completed to ensure we meet these standards, and we want to assure the local community that we will make sure this is done with as minimal disruption as possible. "We would like to thank residents for their patience and apologise for any inconvenience caused." Express Online has contacted Plymouth City Council for comment.
