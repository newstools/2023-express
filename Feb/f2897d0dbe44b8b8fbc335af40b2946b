The Saving Private Ryan actor collapsed in his Los Angeles home, and once he arrived at the hospital, it was determined that he had suffered a brain aneurysm as a result of a stroke. The actor has remained in a critical condition ever since and has been placed in a coma in the intensive care unit. Tom's most recent role was in a new indie science fiction film, Impuratus, playing a police detective forced to believe in the supernatural. He rose to fame in the 1990s with films like Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man, Passenger 27 and True Romance. However, he got his big break in Steven Spielberg's 1998 war film Saving Private Ryan, in which he played Technical Sergeant Mike Horvath. The film went on to score a Best Picture nomination at the Academy Awards, leading Tom to go on to work with directors like Martin Scorsese, Ridley Scott and Michael Bay. However, the actor's life has been riddled with scandals, after he battled drug addiction, and had several run-ins with the law. DON'T MISS...
