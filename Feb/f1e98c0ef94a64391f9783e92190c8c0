The Sailing star texted pal Jim White while Jim was chatting on Talk Sport to Eddy Temple-Morris. DJ Eddy, 57, is patron of My Black Dog, and the charity is hosting a star-studded dinner next month. Rod was so touched by the chat, he stunned listeners by asking to be a part of the event. Jim, 65, said: “As Eddy is speaking I can see that Rod is lighting up my phone.” The veteran broadcaster said Rod, 78, began texting “I’ll come and help Jim!”, “I’ll be there, me old kilt!”. Rod and wife Penny Lancaster, 51, will be joined by stars such as DJ Chris Evans at the March 2 dinner in London. Chris, 56, told the Sunday Express: “My Black Dog is a superbly organised charity that saves lives, plain and simple.”
