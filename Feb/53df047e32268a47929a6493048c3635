 Carol Vorderman, 62, showed off her curves in a pair of skin-tight leather trousers on Monday morning. The television personality danced in slow motion to the tune of George Ezra’s Green Green Grass before turning to face the camera. Carol showed off her Perfect 10 cue card, signalling to her followers in the caption: “It’s Monday, and you know what that means... another daily quiz of Perfect 10. “Just head over to the link in my bio to listen to today’s episode, and please remember, come back to the comments and let me know how many points you got. I LOOOOOVE to hear about it.” The new clip comes barely two days after the media personality was spotted at Alison Hammonds birthday bash on Saturday.
