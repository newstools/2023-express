If you're looking to make some extra money to help tackle the rising cost of living, then you might want to check to see if you have any of these old PlayStation 2 games lying around. Video game collecting is becoming increasingly popular among retro gaming fans, with some games and consoles fetching thousands of pounds. Considering the popularity of the PS2, there's a good chance you're sitting on a fortune, without even realising it. Gaming site Solitaired has put together a list of some of the most valuable PlayStation 2 games based on the cash value offered by UK retailer CEX. At the time of writing, CEX is willing to pay £338 for a copy of PS2 horror game Rule of Rose, provided it comes with a manual. Survival game Michigan: Report From Hell will net you £292 at CEX, while horror games Kuon and Silent Hill Shattered Memories are worth £256 and £146, respectively. The Limited Edition of GTA clone The Getaway is worth £126, followed by Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner at £123.00, and The Silent Hill Collection at £101.00. Needless to say, CEX will offer less money for damaged versions of the aforementioned games, so maybe invest in a nicer box if you're looking to sell. There's also a good chance you could make more money by selling on auction sites such as eBay, although this can be risky. The full list of the ten most valuable PS2 games can be seen below.
