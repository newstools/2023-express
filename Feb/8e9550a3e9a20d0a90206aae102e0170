Kevin Durant has been told it was a "horrible career move" to join forces with Kyrie Irving at the Brooklyn Nets in the wake of the latter issuing a trade demand. Durant has been with the Nets since leaving the Golden State Warriors in 2019. The All-Star guard parted ways with team-mate Steph Curry in order to team up with Irving in Brooklyn. As soon as that move was made, the Nets instantly became one of the most stacked teams in the NBA, though they've struggled to back that up on the court. And now, it seems the Nets' duo is set to be split up, with Irving telling the team he wants to be traded before next week's deadline or leave in free agency this summer. Rival teams are now reportedly inquiring over Durant's reaction to Irving's trade demand, in hopes of the megastar becoming available. And NBA expert Colin Cowherd believes Irving's trade demand proves Durant made the wrong decision in leaving the Warriors for the Nets four years ago.  Speaking on The Herd, he said: "When Kevin Durant left Steph Curry I said this is like Patrick Mahomes joining the [New York] Jets because he has a friend. What are you doing? You're not going from Golden State to Brooklyn, you're trading Steph for cookie Kyrie. "That is nuts. And Durant did it! I'm not a backseat driver here, I thought it was a horrible career move. I thought it was a terrible move by KD, and I've been proven right. "Classic Kyrie bails. Don't go into business with unstable business partners. He was a bust in Cleveland pre-LeBron, he blew up Boston, the vaccine stuff we can agree to disagree on, but who you go into business with... years ago I asked Mark Cuban for advice on a business I was going into. He said 'ideas? Everyone's god ideas. Get good people.' "Brooklyn sounded like a good idea, but he got the wrong people - Kyrie Irving."
