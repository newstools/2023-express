Heidi Klum, 49, showed off her supermodel looks on Instagram this week as she posed in tiny sparkly high-waisted shorts, exposing her endless toned pins. The blonde beauty paired her hot pants with a feather-trimmed top and a matching trench coat. She accessorised with sparkly tights and gold Christian Louboutin heels. Heidi shared her show-stopping ensemble on Instagram in view of her 10.5 million followers, with the simple caption: "Las Vegas." The blonde bombshell also shared an Instagram reel of her outfit, with the camera panning from her feet to unveil every detail of the ensemble. Heidi then showed herself glammed-down the next day as she posed in just a towel looking out of the window to the Vegas skyline with her morning coffee.
