Anthony Joshua opened up on what life is like under new trainer Derrick James at the launch press conference for his April 1 encounter with Jermaine Franklin. Joshua recently relocated to America to work with James and has been doing nothing but training since touching down in Dallas, Texas. "I ain't seen anything," said Joshua when asked about his new home. "I'm a serious person I'm not there for anything else. Throughout my career, this is probably the most serious I've taken it, my food, my sleep, the way I'm training, I study the game. "Everything I've learned good or bad I'm always putting it in another camp. So, I'm not really there to go out for coffees or talk about bulls***, I'm there to f***ing work and put my head down and get ready for a fight." The Watford powerhouse acquired the services of the 2022 Boxing Writers Association of America trainer of the year after parting ways with previous lead Robert Garcia. Joshua and Garcia had only been working together for four months before the split, whilst preparing for AJ's second clash with Oleksandr Usyk.
