The new F1 season is just days away from lights out with anticipation building ahead of the Bahrain Grand Prix. Red Bull, Ferrari and Aston Martin all enjoyed strong pre-season testing last week, but it was a different story for Mercedes. Lewis Hamilton and George Russell both struggled for pace and grip with the former even being let loose to put in a flying lap on the final day of testing. Mercedes boss Toto Wolff doesn't think his team have a chance of being competitive from the get-go, but they do appear to have solved the porpoising issue from last year. There's also the ongoing uncertainty over Hamilton's future at Mercedes with the driver still yet to sign a new contract. Both Hamilton and Wolff indicated a new deal was practically agreed on several occasions last year. But the seven-time world champion is yet to officially put pen to paper and Jenson Button wonders whether his compatriot is waiting to see how Mercedes perform this year. Express Sport brings you all the latest news from the world of F1 as we look ahead to the Bahrain Grand Prix.
