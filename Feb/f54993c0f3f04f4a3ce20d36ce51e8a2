Valentine's Day is a very special one for many lovebirds out there. However, some are left disappointed when they have different expectations from their boo. An anonymous woman took to Mumsnet to vent about a negative Valentine's Day experience. Mumsnet user @scarlettcarbonara was "put out" that her husband failed to get her a Valentine's Day card this year. She told the forum that her "darling husband" had been unwell for a week so had not managed to pop out. However, she made a little dig at his unwillingness to order a card online - "seemingly he's also forgot how to use Amazon/Moonpig etc". She explained that while she didn't "make a fuss", she did feel a little "put out".

The disappointed wife told the forum that she did not expect an extravagant gift or grand gesture. But she admitted to feeling a little hurt that he had made no effort. She explained: "For me a small card is just a token of appreciation. It shouldn't really be a chore and it's not hard work." What made matters worse is that her husband started talking to her about how he should pop out to buy her a card. She felt that this offer was too little too late: "He's made noises about how he really ought to get to the shop to get me a card which to me just screams of him wanting me to tell him not to bother and don't worry about it. "I've calmly tried to explain that there's no point bothering now because he's made it into such a drama and faff that's not what it's about. "If he really wanted to sort something he could have popped out and got one without saying anything like I did with his weeks ago." Lamenting to the forum, she asked her fellow mums if she was being "unreasonable" to think this is "p**s poor".

She did add, however, that usually her husband is very attentive so perhaps just does not "care" about Valentine's Day. Fellow mums, wives and partners flocked to the comments section to say their piece on her grievance. Most were on the husband's side, arguing that Valentine's Day is for honeymoon period couples and teenagers. @originalusername2 offered: "You’re making it a thing when it really doesn’t need to be a thing! Are you in a grownup relationship? I had no idea it was tomorrow and I love my DP to bits." @afs1 seconded this: "Do people in long-term relationships bother with Valentine’s Day? "I always thought it was for teenagers and people in the first couple of years of dating." But others appreciated the wife's disappointment. @lozrox90 commented: "Seeing as everyone seems to think you are being unreasonable, I thought I'd say that I'd feel the same as you. "Been married to darling husband for four years, together 13, and whilst I'm not one for big gifts and gestures I always like a card - it's not too much to ask especially now you can order them online! I would feel put out too."
