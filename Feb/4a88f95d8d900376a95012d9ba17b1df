However, oblivious Sonia isn’t aware that the newcomer has had a change of heart. In next week’s episodes, Reiss is still jealous of Sonia’s new free-spirited lodger. Jed made a huge impact when he arrived in Walford this week and instantly upset Sonia with his questionable living habits. However, she begins to wonder if she judged too quickly when he becomes an instant success with her neighbours. Jed gets the residents of Walford on side when he sets up a community text group.

Realseanslater tweeted: “Wonder if Reiss will be a serial killer, he might kill off a huge character like honey or Ben Mitchell or someone, even Karen Taylor maybe? Would be interesting to see. Obviously he wouldnt be like Gray though #EastEnders.

If that *is* it, I sure hope he doesn't succeed. #EastEnders.” EastEnders airs on BBC One from Monday to Thursday at 7.30pm.
