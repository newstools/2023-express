Millions of families across the UK will receive cost of living support this year from the Government. Some will get £301 this spring as part of the £900 payment, many pensioners could get £300 this winter and those on disability benefits could get 150 for this summer. The £301 payment is the first of five direct cost-of-living sums for the most vulnerable households, including pensioners, with the total amount of support reaching up to £1,350. On the support, Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride said: "These direct payments will help people right across the UK over this year and the start of the next, as we continue to provide consistent, targeted and substantial support for the most vulnerable." The £300 Pensioner Cost of Living Payment will be paid to all households in receipt of Winter Fuel Payments, in the same way as 2022/23 payments were made. Last year, people got a Winter Fuel payment if they were born before September 26, 1956.
