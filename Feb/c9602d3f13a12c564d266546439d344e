Maya Jama, 28, has been taking the UK by storm as she made her debut on Love Island last month as its new presenter, replacing Laura Whitmore. The presenter recently partied the night away with pals in Dubai, taking a break from her ITV role, and shared a fun Instagram video of her evening. Maya showed off her incredible figure in a skintight black dress, with revealing cut-outs, highlighting her curvaceous figure. However, as the ITV presenter danced for the video in the skimpy dress, her assets nearly spilled out of the side cut-outs. She then rushed to grab her cleavage before it was exposed and continued to dance the near-malfunction off.
