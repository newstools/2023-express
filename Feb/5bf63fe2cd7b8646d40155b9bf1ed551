Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts might be one of the best players in the NFL right now, but his unconventional road to the top means his net worth is dwarfed by his Kansas City Chiefs counterpart Patrick Mahomes. Hurts is currently in the penultimate year of his rookie contract, which he signed when he was drafted in the second round in 2020. The 24-year-old earns a reported $4million per season, just 10% of his counterpart Mahomes, who inked a then-NFL-record $500m contract after his rookie deal ended. Despite his current deal, Hurts could end up inking a massive new contract later in the year. The Eagles are reportedly ready to work together with Hurts to negotiate a new deal with the quarterback which could be worth upwards of $200m. Eagles CEO Jeffrey Lurie told ESPN: "I don't think he has anything to prove [to be the long-term answer at quarterback]. He is an MVP-caliber quarterback, an incredible leader of the team on the field, off the field. "He's 24 years old, incredibly mature and, most importantly, driven to be even better. What we're seeing today I think is just the beginning for Jalen. This guy will attack every weakness as he has since high school, since college. The future is bright and very exciting for all of us." As a result of his relatively modest contract, Hurts has a listed net worth of $6m, according to Sportskeeda. Part of the reason for that $6m net worth is his $75,000 workout bonus for each of the three years he's been under contract. The workout bonus means Hurts earns $75,000 for participating in an agreed-upon percentage of the team's off-season workouts.
