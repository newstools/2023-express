Kyle, 33, had travelled from West Yorkshire to Glencoe on February 18. He told loved ones he planned to walk and wild camp on Buachaille Etive Mor and return home three days later. When he did not return, loved ones raised the alarm and a search began with his car located soon after. A body was found in the Glencoe area at around 2.15 on Saturday afternoon following an extensive search by mountain rescue teams and the coastguard. A police spokesperson said: "Kyle's family wish to thank all involved in the search and have requested their privacy be respected. There do not appear to be any suspicious circumstances and a report will be sent to the procurator fiscal."
