 Sarah Jessica Parker, 57, and John Corbett, 61, had a passionate reunion on Thursday night as they filmed a scene for And Just Like That. The follow-up series to the hit show Sex And The City has seen Sarah reprise her role as Carrie Bradshaw to universal acclaim from fans, and now another old character is returning to the show. And Just Like That is filmed on-location in New York City, giving passers-by an entirely new insight into how the show comes together. The actors appeared lost in the moment as they filmed a PDA-packed scene together, with a friendly hug turning into something far more passionate. John last appeared as hunky love interest Aidan Shaw in the 2010 film Sex And The City 2, although he made his debut in the series in 2000. In 2021, the actor teased that he would be in the upcoming Sex And The City sequel series, but fans were left dismayed as he was notably absent for the entire first season.
