And 55 percent of those over 65 also claim to have never ruined a meal on their watch. But those under 34 are most likely to have started from scratch after ruining a dish – or simply ordered a takeaway. It also revealed the most common kitchen mishaps of all respondents were caused by a lack of enthusiasm to cook (27 percent), missing ingredients (22 percent), and lack of time (18 percent). A spokesman for Tesco, which commissioned the research to mark the expansion of its express delivery service, Whoosh, to deliver food within 60 minutes, said: “Whether it’s a special date night or a cosy evening in front of the telly, mealtime moments are an important part of our day. “Though kitchen calamities can be dramatic, the research reveals that most mishaps are down to us simply not having what we need, when we need it – whether that’s a vital ingredient for a recipe, or a quick meal option when time, energy, and enthusiasm are lacking.” The research also revealed some of the kitchen calamities experienced by respondents, including propelling pancakes onto the ceiling which don’t make it back to the pan, and cooking everything for a Sunday roast – except the chicken. Another confessed to over-spicing a dish to the point it was too hot for guests to handle. Most kitchen mishaps tend to happen when people are preparing their midweek dish (22 percent), cooking the Sunday roast (15 percent), or when there are large gatherings of family and friends around (10 percent). It was also found dinner time is the most common time for things to go wrong in the kitchen, according to 49 percent of those polled. As a result, 44 percent would like to get the food they need for their meal delivered to them quickly as and when they need it, according to the study via OnePoll.
