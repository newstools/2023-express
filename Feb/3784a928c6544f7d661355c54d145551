Kate and Prince William were almost blocked from living together as students due to an "unfortunate experience" with their landlord. Following their first year at St Andrew's University, the royal couple hit an unusual speedbump owing to issues the landlord had with some previous male tenants. Having gone for viewings of the property on Hope Street, the future Princess of Wales learned there may be trouble which could prevent her living there with William and two other friends, Fergus Boyd and Olivia Bleasdale. Landlord Charlotte Smith, explained to ivillage.co.uk: "We’d had an unfortunate experience with some boys in the flat once before and we were determined not to have young men there again.

"I said to this young lady we’d really rather not have more boys and she said, "What if I were to tell you that it was Prince William?".
