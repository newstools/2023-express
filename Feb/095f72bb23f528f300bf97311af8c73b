Speaking about their relationship in the Sunday Times, Emer said: "I was boy-crazy throughout my teenage years and early twenties, and often heartbroken, but when I met Rick I was so calm. I felt more myself with him than I had ever felt before. "We make each other laugh constantly. Even when we're arguing or we're both tired or stressed, we find each other funny. I think that's the key to us. We talk about everything, to the tiniest detail of each other's work, because we just really trust each other's opinion."
