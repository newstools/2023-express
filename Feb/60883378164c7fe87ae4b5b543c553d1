An elderly dog abandoned on a country lane in the freezing cold by heartless owners has had to be put down despite the best efforts of vets. The injured German Shepherd, who was named Sebastian by his rescuers, could not stand on his back legs.  Cruel owners had dumped him on Yew Tree Lane in Frankley, Worcestershire, on January 30. He was spotted by a member of the public, who reported the sighting to a local charity, Pet Search Rescue West Midlands. Volunteer Lin Reeves rushed to rescue the dog, but little could be done to save him. Sebastian was put to sleep on "welfare grounds" after vets found severe internal bleeding in his stomach, reports Birmingham Live.     A spokesperson for Pet Search Rescue West Midlands said: "I'm absolutely disgusted with whoever dumped Sebastian and left him in such a cruel and wicked way. "How I'm restraining myself from swearing is unbelievable. "Fly-tipping an elderly dying dog alone up a country lane, freezing cold at night like an old mattress or fridge-freezer. "Someone needs to be punished for this - rest in peace Sebastian." Tributes to Sebastian have poured in on social media from heartbroken members of the public. One person commented: "Absolutely soul destroying that anyone could do this to such a loyal companion. I honestly just can’t understand. "Such a shame it wasn’t a happier ending for this beautiful boy, however his crossing over the rainbow bridge with someone there to love him would’ve made him happy enough." Another person said said: "So happy that he was picked up so he didn't have to die cold and alone on the street - sleep well baby." A third person added: "Whoever knows the evil owners, name and shame them… absolutely disgusting to abandon this poor dog.. Your dogs are your family."
