Research found one in 10 mothers are tired of getting make-up and skincare products, or handy appliances such as hot air brushes or air fryers – in fact almost half have either thrown away, given them away or not used them. Instead of the 1,500 mums surveyed, almost half (45 percent) preferred to ditch the flowers, perfume and chocolates for some quality time with their children on March 19. But according to the data, this might be trickier than it seems, with one in 10 parents only seeing their grown-up kids once a year – with the main reason that they live too far away (54 percent). One-fifth of mums say their children reside more than 5,000 miles away and 87 percent agreed that the most important thing about being a mum is enjoying family time. Now – on a mission to reconnect families – Red Letter Days who conducted the survey are stepping in to give mums what they really want in 2023 … time with their kids even if they live far away. The leading gift experience provider has launched a brand-new offering on its website – the option to apply for flights home to see mum. Launching now, Brits from all over the world can register their interest in a homecoming for the ultimate reunion surprise. Christine Ducker, the senior comms manager at Red Letter Days, said: "When Mother’s Day rolls round we routinely give mums the same things without really thinking about what they actually want – as our research proves. "But sometimes the best presents are the simplest and we need to prioritise time with our mums over sending token flowers. "At Red Letter Days, we pride ourselves on helping people create connections through experiences and what better way to do this than reunite mums with their children by offering people a flight home for Mother’s Day." * Anyone hoping to be in with the chance to fly home and see mum this Mother’s Day, needs to fill in the form here. The competition closes on March 5 with winners chosen on a case-by-case basis.
