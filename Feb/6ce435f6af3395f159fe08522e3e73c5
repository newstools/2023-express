Hollywood actress Salma Hayek, 56, dazzled as she arrived at Gucci's Milan Fashion Week show alongside her husband François-Henri Pinault, 60, who is the founder of Kering, the owner of the luxury designer brand. The couple were accompanied by their daughter Valentina, 15, who looked just like her mum in a pastel blue shirt, paired with a leather pencil skirt and Gucci platform heels, to pay homage to the Italian label. The trio were also joined by Valentina's half-sister Mathilde, 22, who is one of businessman Pinault's three older children from previous relationships. Mathilde, who looked chic in oversized sunglasses and a little black dress, is Pinault's child with his first wife Dorothée Lepère. Alongside Gucci, Pinault's company also owns Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta, Alexander McQueen, and Yves Saint Laurent.
