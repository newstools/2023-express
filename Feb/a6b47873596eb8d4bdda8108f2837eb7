 Cruz Beckham celebrated his 18th birthday with his world-famous parents, Victoria and David Beckham, as he enjoyed his first legal pint. The aspiring musician also casually showed off a suave new gold Rolex in snaps his mum shared with her 30 million Instagram followers. The distinctive watch, believed to be a Rolex Submariner Date, is usually priced around £32,900, with vintage editions costing up to £48,990. This isn’t the first time the youngster has seemingly received a regal watch for his birthday. On his 16th the teenager donned a silver Submariner, albeit a far less valuable item costing around £9,100. Cruz’s social media was flooded with birthday wishes from his family, with Victoria and David posting sweet throwbacks while his older brothers shared some poignant memories with their “lil bro”.
