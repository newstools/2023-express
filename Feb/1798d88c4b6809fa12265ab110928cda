Carol Vorderman, 62, sent fans into a frenzy earlier today as she posted a video of herself strutting in slow motion. The former Countdown star took to Instagram to share the clip in view of her 312,000 followers, announcing: “Slow mo strutting my way into Friday’s.” She could be seen making her way through the ITV studios sporting a big smile as she posed for the camera. Carol chose to flaunt her curves in a figure-hugging printed pencil skirt and a skin-tight long-sleeved top in stone. She also cinched her svelte waist using a large black belt, while completing the look with matching platform shoes.
