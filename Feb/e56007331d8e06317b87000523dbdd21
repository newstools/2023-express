In their first to the county since becoming the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall, Kate and William visited the National Maritime Museum, where Mr Embury now volunteers since relocating from Berkshire, where Kate grew up. The pair hugged and chatted after she spotted him in the crowd, as she told him: "The things you taught me, I now teach to my children." Mr Embury told the MailOnline: "I hate to think what those children are learning!" He said: "It was an incredible meeting and the first time I had seen Kate in 25 years. She hasn't changed, not one bit, and is just like she was - conscientious, considerate and exuberant." Mr Embury, who came into the museum on his day off to see the princess, added: "She is a wonderful woman. I didn't know she was coming to the museum until 6am this morning. "It was my day off and I only work Fridays. We were asked if we would be available to be on standby for the royal visit, and of course I wanted to. "The prospect of meeting Kate after all these years was very exciting so I went in on my day off."
