He was family and taught me so much about taking risks, and creativity and trust.  "His professionalism, talents and dedication to the craft made him a pillar in the industry, but it was his humour, compassion and loving heart that made him family. "Our condolences go out to his loved ones as we join them in mourning his loss, but also in celebrating his memory."
