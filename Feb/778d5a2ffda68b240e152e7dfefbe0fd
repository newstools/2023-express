England's 50 "worst places to live" have been revealed after more than 100,000 people took part in an annual survey. Each year, satirical website iLiveHere asks residents across the nation to consider whether their town or city should have the dubious accolade. It's 2022 list was topped by Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire which voters dubbed an "eyesore concrete jungle".  Huddersfield and Liverpool also appeared in the top 10 last year. This time around the "worst towns and cities" are somewhat different - with a port city and a quiet commuter town emerging in the top six. But it's Luton in this year's number one slot with one voter saying: "The town itself is not easy on the eye." Another stated: "It makes Slough comparable to the Playboy tax haven of Monaco." The Bedfordshire town, which sits by the M1 around 35 miles north of London's centre, was called an "absolute hole" in the poll last year, when it came third. Last year, one person on the iLivehere website said of Luton: "I kid you not, I saw a police raid on a house using a battering ram to bash down the door to a drug den. I wouldn’t mind but this was just before 8am in the morning. You can imagine what it was like walking home at night. "As summed up by someone at work who was visiting from the Prague office, 'I didn’t know what to expect from Luton. I was a little concerned because most friends I spoke with described it as England’s toilet'".   Peterborough, which is in Cambridgeshire, slumped to second - two years after topping the charts. The comments about the cathedral city, home to around 180,000, were rather blunt, with one stating "it should have been destroyed during World War Two but even Hitler and Göring didn't think it was worth botherng with." The voters also didn't like Portsmouth, the port city in Hampshire and home to around 210,000 people. "Portsmouth was an island and I bet people are wondering why they connected it to the mainland, and didn't let it just drift away," one voter said.   Slough in Berkshire pops up at fourth this time - after only reaching ninth in 2022. It was slated for its unaesthetic appeal. One voter said: "If the Earth ever requires an enema, Slough is undoubtedly where the tube will be inserted." Despite being regarded as the "worst place to live in England" last year, Aylesbury only reached fifth in the list this time. It has again been slammed for traffic problems and "thrashy" locals. "Being stuck in the traffic allows you to observe the magnificent beauty of all the 'thrashy' citizens that live there," one comment reads. The website compiles the 50 worst places to live - and the 50 best places to live - in England. Often, towns and cities make the list on consecutive years. And many of the usual suspects, including Jaywick, Andover, Middlesbrough and Stoke-on-Trent, have made the list again in 2023. 50. NORTHAMPTON 49. IPSWICH 48. HULL 47. CANTERBURY 46. JAYWICK 45.
