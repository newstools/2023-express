Popular kitchen appliance manufacturer Cosori is recalling two million air fryers after receiving 205 complaints of them overheating, melting, smoking and catching fire. Users have reported minor burns and property damage as a result. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has ruled the Cosori appliances to be a fire risk and unsafe for users. Among the 205 complaints, 10 reported minor burns and 23 reported minor property damage, according to the product safety agency. The CPSC announced it would be recalling the products on Thursday morning and has urged consumers to immediately stop using the appliances. The recall includes several different model numbers in 3.7-quart and 5.8-quart sizes. The model numbers can be found on the bottom of each unit and in the user manual. The fires are believed to have been caused by a wire connection, which is prone to overheating and can burst into flames if it gets too hot. In a statement on its website, Cosori said: "After a thorough investigation, we determined that in extremely rare circumstances, the closed-end crimp connectors within the recalled air fryers — which are responsible for establishing electrical connections between certain wires — can overheat, posing fire and burn hazards." As well as recalling the items in the US, about 250,000 in Canada and 21,000 in Mexico have also been recalled. Consumers are asked to contact the company at recall.cosori.com and they will receive a free replacement air fryer or a different product from their range.
