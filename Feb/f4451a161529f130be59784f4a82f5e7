Russia could receive hundreds of Chinese kamikaze drones that would allow it to carry out deadly attacks on Ukrainian cities, it has been claimed. The Russian military is in talks with Chinaâ€™s Xi'an Bingo Intelligent Aviation Technology over the mass production of the destructive weapons, according to a report from German newspaper Der Spiegel. A source told the publication the design could be similar to that of Iran's Shahed 136 kamikaze drone, which were used to attack cities and power plants in Ukraine. Xi'an Bingo Intelligent Aviation Technology has agreed to produce and test 100 ZT-180 prototype drones before delivering them in April, according to the report. The Chinese company is then reportedly planning to deliver components and know-how to Russia so it can make around 100 drones a month itself. Military experts have warned the ZT-180 could be capable of carrying a warhead as heavy as 50kg. This possible development comes with China calling for peace talks and a ceasefire in the Ukraine war in an extraordinary intervention as the country tries to become a peacemaker.
