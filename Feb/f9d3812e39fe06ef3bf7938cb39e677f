King Charles has "played a blinder" in the way he handled the issue of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex attending his Coronation, a commentator has claimed. Former BBC Royal Correspondent Michael Cole argued the monarch left the difficult choice of accepting or rejecting the invitation - and the following consequences - to the historic event to Meghan and Prince Harry. Speaking with Sky News Australia host Paul Murray, Mr Cole said: "The King, actually, has played a blinder here. He’s made it clear from the very beginning that his youngest son, and his youngest son’s wife, are perfectly welcome at the Coronation. And of course, that puts the ball in their court – they have to decide, if they decide they don’t come it will make them look a little bit petty and mean-spirited. And of course, if they do come, it will leave them open to the charge of hypocrisy." FOLLOW THIS LIVE BLOG FOR UPDATES ON THE ROYAL FAMILY
