Russia’s major spring offensive could have already started as they step up attacks across eastern Ukraine, increasing strikes on conflict areas and massing hundreds of thousands of soldiers. Ukrainian officials have warned that they are on “the eve of a very active phase of the war”, while President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested such a period had “started” already. NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said earlier this week that “more than 200,000” Russian soldiers are “preparing for more war”. It comes as Putin prepares to make a speech later today from the city formerly known as Stalingrad to commemorate the Soviets’ defeat of the Nazis in a decisive World War II battle. His last speech, in September, included the mobilisation of 300,000 Russian soldiers to Ukraine. But Ukraine's defence minister Oleksii Reznikov said the number could be closer to 500,000. He added: "We do not underestimate our enemy. Officially they announced 300,000 but when we see the troops at the borders, according to our assessments it is much more."
