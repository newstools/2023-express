Carol Vorderman, 62, made jaws drop as she showcased her pert bottom in red leather trousers in a cheeky Instagram video this morning. The former Countdown host wiggled her bottom before slowly turning to face the camera as she announced another week of her Perfect 10 programme. Carol wore skintight leather trousers paired with a cow print high-neck jumper and suede black boots. Her hair was highlighted honey blonde and worn in loose waves. To complete the look, the age-defying maths expert wore a smokey bronze eye with nude lipstick. Carol typed: “It’s Monday and you know what that means… another week of Perfect 10! 10 questions, 10 points, all done in 10 minutes @perfect10carol. Are you ready for a brain workout?
