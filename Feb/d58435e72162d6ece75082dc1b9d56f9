King Charles III's second cousin Lord Ivar Mountbatten has upset locals over his reported plans to begin charging people to walk their dogs on his estate. The rumoured charge is £60. Lord Ivar explained in the local parish magazine that the cost of living crisis was taking its toll. He said: "The rise in living and operational costs in the past 12 months means our maintenance, management and operational obligations have spiralled far higher than the return of coffee, cake and community events can cover. "James and I are left with some tough decisions for the year ahead. "I want to continue to offer access to the Orangery and Parkland across seven days a week."

Speaking to Mail Online, one dog walker said that people "are not very happy". They added: "It is one thing charging non-locals a day fee to visit but quite another exploiting what is really a captive audience. I don’t think people will pay it." They continued: "It is a pleasant enough park, but you have to keep your dog on the lead because of all the deer roaming around and all the water birds on the lake."
