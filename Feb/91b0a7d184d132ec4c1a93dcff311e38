A family have paid tribute to their "smiling and happy" baby girl after their 10-month-old died tragically while in the bath with her two brothers. Little Sara Moosa drowned in just five inches of water after a plastic toy got stuck over the plughole, causing the bath to fill. An inquest at Leicester Town Hall heard how Sara's mother had put her in the bath with her two brothers, who are twins and had the tap running without the plug in while she bathed them. One of the boys asked for his shark toy and his mother went to fetch it. But when she returned, little Sara was lying on her side in the bath with her face under the water. In a statement from the family to the inquest, Sara was described as a "smiling and happy" little girl, reports Leicestershire Live. She was pronounced dead at Leicester Royal Infirmary on August 14 last year. A post-mortem examination was carried out and concluded she had died from drowning. Summarising what happened, coroner Isobel Thistlethwaite said: "Sara and her two siblings were in the bath with the water running but no plug in. "One sibling requested a toy. The mother returned and she noticed another toy had blocked the plug hole. The two siblings were standing up and Sara was on her side, under the water." The family called 999 and, following the instructions of the ambulance operator, tried to perform CPR to get Sara's heart beating again. A statement was read out from a paramedic who arrived to find Sara downstairs on the kitchen counter where her family were performing CPR.  The paramedics took over and then took Sara to an ambulance to continue trying to resuscitate her. They went to the hospital with Sara and her mother but she could not be saved. Miss Thistlethwaite recorded a conclusion of accidental death. She said: "No concerns were raised by the police following an inspection of the scene."
