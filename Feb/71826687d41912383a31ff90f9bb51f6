The decision marks a departure from previous coronations, the role was previously carried out by duchesses and is considered one of the most sacred parts of the ceremony. A source said: “The Queen Consort has said she does not want duchesses. She would like it to be her grandchildren. It’s a significant decision given the fact Camilla's grandchildren have been largely shielded from the spotlight over the years.” However, sources close to the King and Queen Consort say they are keen to get them involved to reflect their reality as a blended family and show how close they are to the teenagers. Lola and Freddy are children of Camilla’s son Tom Parker Bowles’ while Eliza, Louis, and Gus are the children of her daughter Laura Lopes. Alongside the teenagers, the future King, Prince George is also expected to be handed a role.
