Roaring lions, giraffe sculptures and a troop of gorillas, alongside wallowing hippo arrangements, will be the star attractions among the stunning displays the Princess of Wales Conservatory. The arrangements take place across the 10 different climatic zones which make up Kew’s conservatory, replicating a series of global ecosystems under one roof. Horticulturists Henrick Röling and Solène Dequiret worked tirelessly at the west London venue yesterday to maintain the iconic lion-inspired showpiece – a key attraction at the Cameroon-themed floral display. Orchids After Hours will also return for 2023, with live music, food and drink. Entry to the orchid experience is only £1 for recipients of Pension Credit, Universal Credit and Legacy Benefits.
