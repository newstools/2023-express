 The celebrity chef, 50, and television producer Louise, 46, have been in a steady relationship since 2011. Despite their 12-year-long romance, the couple are rarely spotted together, as James Martin endeavours to keep his private life out of the public eye. Louise, who walked arm-in-arm with the star, undoubtedly turned heads in her colourful, patterned coat, while he looked smart in a waistcoat. The adorable couple met in 2010 when James appeared on Celebrity Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. While the chef wasn’t able to take home the prize on-screen, he caught Louise’s eye and they have been one of the most steadfast, although rarely seen, couples in British television. In 2019, James revealed he actually has no plans to propose or walk down the aisle. He told Sunday People: “I don't need to spend 60 grand on a day, no, I'm more than happy thanks."
