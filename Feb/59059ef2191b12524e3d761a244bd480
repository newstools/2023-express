A source at the time confirmed to PEOPLE that the pair were not romantically involved. The source said: "They are both single right now and get along great. "Sean has always said that Robin is the love of his life. He regrets many things that happened during their marriage. He really enjoys spending time with her now." The sighting was the first time the pair had been seen together since 2017, when they had a similar outing to visit their son Hopper. Both Robin and Sean recently ended their new relationships last year, with Penn finalising his divorce from Leila George in April 2022.

Worse than that. "One of the reasons why we got back together and broke up so much was trying to keep the family together. "If you've got kids, it's a family, and you try again, and you try again. We did that for a long time." Penn also spoke to Vanity Fair just after the divorce in 2010, saying that Wright was "a ghost to me now." He said: "We spent all those years together. Now she's just gone." Sean also discussed his life after Robin filed for divorce in 2018 on the WTF With Marc Baron podcast, admitting that the couple "don't have a lot of conversation". He added: "We don't not get along. We have very separate relationships with our kids at this point and it seems to work better that way because they are making their own decisions. "As it turned out she and I did not share the same ethical views on parenting, including the continuing parenting of adult children."
