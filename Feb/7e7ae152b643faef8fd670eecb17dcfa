Commuters faced rush hour chaos this morning after a lorry ploughed into a car on the M6. Traffic was stopped in both directions on the motorway following the crash on the southbound carriageway near junction 10 for Wolverhampton, West Midlands.  Authorities expected drivers to face delays of an hour as the motorway remained closed until 10.30am. Traffic was back to junction 7 for Great Barr, Birmingham, on the northbound side and back to junction 11 for Cannock, Staffordshire on the southbound carriageway. National Highways West Midlands tweeted: "Traffic is stopped in both directions on the M6 within J10 Walsall due to a collision involving a lorry and a car. The lorry has overturned and come to rest on its side. Delays are building in both directions. Please avoid the area if possible and allow extra travel time." The HGV overturned and came to rest on its side, reports Birmingham Live. In a statement issued at around 7am, National Highways said: "No serious injuries occurred in the incident however there is a significant infrastructure damage to the central reservation and a lamp column. In addition due to the lorry involved having overturned it is anticipated this closure will be on for a protracted period for a complex recovery, clean-up and repair operation. "This incident is currently causing a delay of 60 mins in both directions and there is approximately six miles of heavy congestion southbound and four miles northbound. "If this incident impacts on your planned route, please allow extra journey time. Plan ahead, you may wish to re-route or even delay your journey." Diversions were in place for motorists on both carriageways, exiting M6 at junction 10 for Wolverhampton. The M5 was slow as a result of the queues, with northbound traffic congested from junction 2 for Oldbury, West Midlands, to the M6 link itself.
