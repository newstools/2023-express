Judge Robert Rinder, 44, sparked concern this week after sharing pictures of himself in hospital, after having issues with a "prolapsed disc" in his back. However, the ITV star appeared to be healing well as he was pictured posing up a storm yesterday, alongside Alan Carr at The Reluctant Traveller European premiere. Robert cut a stylish figure in black trousers and a royal blue shirt, with the buttons at the top left open. Meanwhile, Alan went for a brown blazer, paired with lighter trousers and a paisley-patterned shirt underneath. Robert also made his social media return as he shared an Instagram story of a bunch of roses he had been gifted for Valentine's by singer Lulu. THE RELUCTANT TRAVELLER will be out on Apple TV+ on 24th February
