Princess Anne has returned to a maternity hospital that she opened more than 40 years ago. The Princess Royal toured the Princess Anna Hospital in Southampton, meeting parents Amy Hartnell and David Austin, who had their son Albert George on Thursday. Anne opened the hospital back in March 1981. Ms Hartnell said her father was part of the police escort that transported the royal to the hospital on that day. Anne also spoke to parents Siobhan and Joe Biles, from Southampton. They introduced their little boy Cody to the princess. Anne is a Patron of the Royal College of Midwives, and has carried out a lot of work related to childbirth and midwifery. The Princess Royal stopped to speak with midwives at the hospital, where staff provide a wide range of services including home births. The hospital also serves as a hub in the local area for foetal and maternal medicine. Care is provided for women with medical problems during pregnancy. Emma Northover, director of midwifery at Princess Anne Hospital, said: "I know our midwives and hospital staff very much enjoyed having the opportunity to speak to her and highlight the great work happening across our midwifery teams." While in Southampton, Anne also attended a reception at Southampton Civic Centre to acknowledge the city being awarded Lord Mayoralty status as part of the late Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations. Southampton was given the prestigious award in May last year, meaning the city's mayor will now be known as a Lord Mayor. This status was previously given to Chester in 1992, Exeter in 2002, and Armagh in 2012.
