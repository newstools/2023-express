In a letter Hugh Nicol, factor of Argyll Estates, said reports from the local area suggest it is the “wealthier residents” who are were involved. Mr Nicol added “the reasons for this may not always be need, but perhaps greed”. Argyll Estates owns part of the shoreline from the high to the lower water mark around Tiree, an area with a population of 650. In his letter, Mr Nicol wrote: “I have had credible reports of substantial illegal commercial sand and gravel extraction on Tiree shores and beaches. “This is not new, but I understand the theft this year is again out of hand. Neither is it new for very few people to note it now and then for many to grumble in spring and summer at the winter damage that they watched happening without comment or challenge.

I’m just trying to get something done to stop this happening”. Meanwhile, community councillor Dr John Holliday said the sand was being used to look after livestock. In a statement, Tiree Community Council (TCC) said: “TCC is very clear in recognising the value of crofting and farming to the island’s economy, culture and population.  "TCC is also clear that local sand and gravel currently play a key role in making this industry more economically viable here, and in improving the welfare of livestock. TCC shares the concerns of many of our constituents about the erosion of parts of the island’s coastline. "TCC would encourage Argyll Estates to work constructively with the crofting community to provide more clarity on what constitutes acceptable and sustainable use, and guidance on locations where long-term impact on coastal erosion would be minimal, or entirely balanced by natural replacement.”
