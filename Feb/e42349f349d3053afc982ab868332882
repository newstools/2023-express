Mark Edwards (played by Riley Jones) first met DCI Vera Stanhope (Brenda Blethyn) after he discovered the body of a mum at the side of the road. However, it didn't take the officer long to impress the detective as he quickly became an integral part of the team and is often seen doing the background work for the detective. After spending 12 years in the role, Riley opened up in an exclusive interview with Express.co.uk about his future on the show. The actor went on to address whether there are plans for a series 13. Fans were left gutted last weekend when the final episode of series 12 played out, and while series 13 hasn't been confirmed, Riley shared his hopes of a return. "Yeah, I don't know," he admitted when quizzed on whether series 13 is on the cards. "I obviously hope there is and I'll be waiting to see if we get that call.

When asked whether he thinks about his future as Mark and where his character will be in five years' time, Riley explained he tries not to. "I tend not to really because all of that is out of your hands as an actor really," he shared. "You just do what you can and then when the scripts come in, and you read them, you can't really have much influence over that." "So it's nice," the Mark Edwards star added as he paid a tribute to the "brilliant writers". "I mean, obviously all of the writers are brilliant, but what I think Sally does really well, is that she does think about the ensemble and some of those nicer moments. "What's nice about Sally's events and things, is it's really interesting to get to talk to the writers because we don't get to do that very often." "I am happy to be working and doing the job," he explained.
