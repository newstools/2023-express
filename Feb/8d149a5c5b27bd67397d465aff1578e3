Liz Truss inflamed the growing Tory taxation row as she took a swipe at opponents in the party for thwarting her plan for Britain. In her first broadcast interview since being forced from power, the former Prime Minister said the Conservative Party was not “fertile ground” for the tax-cutting agenda she tried to implement.  She said her party “had not moved in a free market direction” in the past decade and needed to “start building more of a strong intellectual base”. Her remarks come amid bitter Tory divisions over whether the government should cut taxes to help boost growth and ease the burden on hard-pressed families. Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt have indicated there are unlikely to be tax cuts in next month’s budget as they focus on tackling inflation. But a growing number of Tories, including former PM Boris Johnson, have urged Mr Sunak and the Chancellor to release the handbrake and slash taxes. In the interview with Spectator TV, Ms Truss conceded her plan to abolish the 45p top rate of income tax was “a bridge too far”.   Taking aim at the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), Ms Truss said: “The OBR and its position is taken very seriously by the market, so it effectively constrains what the Government can do. “It’s very important that forecasts are honest, but I think we have ended up in a place where they’re done so separately of government that it ends up driving fiscal policy.” Despite her disastrous time in No 10 – which saw the pound crash and interest rates soar – Ms Truss said she did not regret going for the top job. But she said she does not want to be Prime Minister again. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his “heart sank” as Ms Truss returned to offer her thoughts on the economy.
