Brooklyn Beckham, who is clearly head over heels in love with wife Nicola Peltz at just 23, tied the knot with her in a fairytale wedding reportedly costing millions last April. Now he has spoken out about expressing his love for her through body art, revealing that the experience has been "addictive". The son of football legend David Beckham and fashion entrepreneur Victoria claimed that more than 20 of his tattoos are dedicated solely to Nicola in a new interview with E! News. "They're very addictive, especially when you love someone you just want to cover everywhere!" he declared. He even had his wedding vows etched on his arm, an unexpected gesture of love which made Nicola well up with tears.
