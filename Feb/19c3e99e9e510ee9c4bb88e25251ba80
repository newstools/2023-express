Seven more Memphis police officers are facing disciplinary action over the death of Tyre Nichols. Legal officer Jennifer Sink has announced new internal charges are being considered, which would take the number of disciplined officers to 13.    Six have already been fired in connection with a January traffic stop which led to the beating and eventual death of Mr Nichols, 29. The latest action is internal and not the same as criminal charges. However, five officers have been charged with second-degree murder in connection with Mr Nichols’ death. Ms Sink made the announcement during a Memphis council meeting on Tuesday - one month after Mr Nichols was stopped by police in the city for what they said was a traffic violation.   Video released after pressure from Mr Nichols’ family shows officers holding him down and repeatedly punching, kicking and striking him with a baton as he screamed for his mother. The FedEx worker and father to a four-year-old boy died in hospital three days later. Officers Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, Emmitt Martin III, Desmond Mills Jr and Justin Smith were fired following an internal probe and face second-degree murder charges.
