A teacher has died after being fatally stabbed by a student at a Catholic school in France earlier today. The pupil was arrested after the attack, which took place in the town of Saint-Jean-de-Luz.    A student told French media that the attacker got up from his seat during a lesson, holding a bladed weapon between sheets of paper. He had reportedly blocked the door of the classroom before lunging at the teacher with the 10cm long knife and stabbing them in the chest. Paramedics arrived at Saint-Thomas d'Aquin Catholic high school but could not revive the teacher. A top government official, speaking anonymously because he was not allowed to discuss the issue publicly, but police suggest the attacker has severe mental health issues.   French media reported that the student, born in 2007, said he heard voices telling him to kill the 53-year-old teacher of Spanish at the private Catholic school in Saint-Jean-de-Luz. Education Minister Pap Ndiaye was to head to the school later today. French government spokesman Olivier Veran, speaking after a weekly Cabinet meeting, expressed the government's support for the education community and said the event represents a trauma for the nation. Pyrénées-Atlantiques Senator Frédérique Espagnac has sent her condolences to the teacher's family and said she "totally condemns this act of violence against a teacher".   In 2020, teacher Samuel Paty was killed outside his school in suburban Paris by an 18-year-old refugee of Chechen origin who was angry that he had shown caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad in class after the images were re-published by a satirical newspaper targeted in a 2015 attack.
