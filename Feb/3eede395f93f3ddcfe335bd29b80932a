A Lotus Esprit - the model immortalised in the 1977 James Bond film ‘The Spy Who Loved Me’ - could be sold for just £20,000. The Esprit was made famous not just by builder Colin Chapman’s technical expertise, but by its keynote role as getaway car and submarine in the iconic film. However, while the car in question looks like Bond’s Esprit, it wasn’t actually used in the making of the film. The car in question is a 1982 Lotus Esprit v3, one of just 1,053 ever built by renowned road and racing car builder, Lotus. The car was bought by a farmer who, having seen the Bond film, wanted a car which looked just like it. In subsequent years, the farmer enjoyed the car, but had to retire it to a barn after falling ill.

Despite the accumulation of nature on the bodywork, the family believe the car will sell for around £20,000 when it goes under the hammer at Charterhouse Auctions in Sherbourne, Dorset. Auctioneer Richard Bromell told The Sun: “Arguably the most famous Lotus Esprit was the one used by Roger Moore as James Bond in The Spy Who Loved me which morphed into a submarine and this was the car which inspired the owner to buy his white Lotus Esprit 3. "Today it looks slightly sad covered in a film of dust and dirt in the barn but that is only superficial. I am sure the lucky new owner will have this Lotus back on the road in no time.” One of the original Lotus Esprits used in the making of 'The Spy Who Loved Me' was bought by Twitter owner Elon Musk who reportedly intends to make it capable of travelling on land and sea.
