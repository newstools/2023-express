On Tuesday’s instalment of BBC’s The One Show, hosts Alex Jones and Jermaine Jenas welcomed Danny Dyer, Ellie Taylor, Joel Dommett and Tom Grennan onto the sofa. Although when speaking about Danny’s upcoming BBC gameshow, the presenter took a brutal swipe at the 45-year-old. Introducing the duo to viewers, Alex asked them to explain a bit more about what people can expect in their new quiz show called Cheat.The former Strictly star informed the hosts contestants taking part can answer the question if they know it, but if they don’t they’re able to press a button to give them the answer.However, the 39-year-old revealed the other players won’t know who has pressed the button or not, which means they have to work out who among them is lying.After playing a snippet of the upcoming series, Jermaine questioned the duo on what their roles are in the show.

When we were filming I thought I was doing a lot but actually, when I watched it, I thought, ‘you’re not doing much in it’.“I just float about and I try to stir the pot because what you want is the contestants kicking off with each other, throwing shade and it’s about the psychology.” DON'T MISS...

However, Danny Dyer fans will be able to see him on-screen once again in another drama as he’s set to star in Channel 5’s Heat.Speaking about his decision to join the cast, he told Alex: “I left EastEnders, it was a very emotional thing for me and I signed up for this other job.“I literally left, packed a bag and then flew to Australia. The only reason I did it, it was a really good script and everything, but I wanted to work in the sunshine.“I got to Melbourne and it rained every single day.”The One Show continues weekdays on BBC One from 7pm.
