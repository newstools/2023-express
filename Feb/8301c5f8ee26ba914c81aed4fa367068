Amanda Holden, 51, embraced winter fashion as she strutted into the Heart FM offices in a skintight tan knitted dress and a matching pair of sexy thigh-high boots.  Explaining her sartorial choice, the Britain’s Got Talent judge and radio host told her 1.9 million Instagram followers: “Today I thought I would go snug and saucy.”  However, after slapping her thigh while showing off her boots, the star suffered an unfortunate wardrobe mishap.  After spotting one of her boots slipping down to create a sagging shape at her knee, Amanda admitted: “That’s not sexy.”  While quickly pulling the shoe back into place on her leg, the blonde beauty quipped: “That’s not bad for her age.”
