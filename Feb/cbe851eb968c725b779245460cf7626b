She tops a galaxy of UK stars telling Elle how they push the boundaries through their varied projects. Emma, 27 – Diana, Princess of Wales in Netflix’s series The Crown – identifies as non-binary. She appears in a punk-rock version of Virginia Woolf’s 1928 novel Orlando about a poet who changes gender, at the West End’s Garrick Theatre. On her inspiration to grasp the role, Emma says: “It’s such a brilliant book that teaches you so much about identity and love – all these fundamental questions that we ask. The adaptation is very much a celebration of theatre as well as a celebration of queer joy.” Outfits for her shoot were provided by stylist Harry Lambert, a friend since they worked on The Crown and Emma’s portrayal of the late Royal. She adds: “He’s always wanting to advocate for young British designers.” Bafta-tipped Micheal Ward and Daryl McCormack plus Anya Chalotra, Rosy McEwen, Jonah Hauer-King and Dafne Keen are also in the March issue of Elle, on sale now.
