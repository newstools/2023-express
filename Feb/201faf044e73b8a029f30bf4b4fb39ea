After weeks of waiting, Samsung has finally unleashed its new Galaxy S23 range of devices which will all go on sale later this month. These latest call makers, which include a standard 6.1-inch model along with a bigger 6.5-inch S23+ version and ultimate S23 Ultra, all include a faster Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor, better battery life, more eco-friendly design and improved cameras. In fact, the S23 Ultra gets a massive 200-megapixel lens which can even shoot perfect pictures of the night sky thanks to its Atstrophotogrphy settings. Prices start from £849 for the standard model with things rising to over £1,200 for anyone who fancies taking delivery of that super premium Ultra. That is a slight cost increase over last year's Galaxy S22 models but Samsung is trying to soften the blow thanks to some very enticing trade-in deals. There's even the option to hand over certain Android devices and get a whopping £600 off something new. That means you could take delivery of the Ultra for under £700 which is a bit of a bargain. Along with getting all of that money knocked off the asking price, there is also six months of Disney+ for free and the option to pay things back over 36 months without incurring any interest. That deal allows you to pocket the S23 for as little £23.59 per month. One final pre-order offer that's definitely worth checking out is the option to buy boosted storage versions of the S23 for the same price as their smaller siblings. For example, the S23 with 128GB of storage usually costs £849 but you can pay exactly the same for the version with a more useful 256GB of memory. Opt for the whopping 512GB S23+ or S23 Ultra and you'll also get it for the same price as the smaller 256GB option - now that's a deal Apple needs to follow! If that all sounds enticing here are all the offers and how much Samsung is giving back when you trade in your old device.
