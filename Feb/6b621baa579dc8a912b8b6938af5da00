As one of the biggest weeks at Manchester United since Sir Alex Ferguson's 2013 retirement continues, the takeover developments keep coming. And the Glazers maintaining control of the club is slowly emerging as an increasing possibility amid trouble in the water with bidders. The Glazer family have reportedly told Qatari banker Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani and INEOS chief Sim Jim Ratcliffe to stop their 'vitriolic' public statements. These include part of Sheikh Jassim's public pledge where he said he was determined to return United to their 'glory years'. It has been viewed as a criticism of the Red Devils' current owners and may have increased the possibility of them staying at the helm. Elliott Investment Management are said to be ready to finance that outcome in what would be a nightmare scenario for most supporters desperate for change. The Raine Group are claimed to have set the end of March as the deadline to wrap up the process, whether it's a takeover or minority investment. If not, United's ownership picture is bound to be clear by the end of the season at the very latest. Follow LIVE updates below...
