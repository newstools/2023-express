Madonna, 64, looked younger than ever as she took to Instagram to tease more dates for her comeback Celebration Tour. The Like a Virgin hitmaker posted three pictures, marked with the exciting message: "Add More Shows?" Along with the tour teaser, Madonna showed off her ageless appearance as she posed in a revealing fishnet lace top. The Vogue singer also flaunted her toned legs in skimpy high-waisted black shorts and chunky black boots with a diamond-style sole. The Hollywood star posed seductively beside a bathtub as anticipation grew around her 40th-anniversary world tour.
