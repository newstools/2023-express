Boy George and Culture Culture are celebrating their triple platinum album Colour By Numbers’ 40th anniversary with a special one-day-only cinema event for fans. The band will be streaming a live show from Los Angeles for the first time ever, being made available across the globe including in over 100 British and Irish cinemas. A career-spanning set full of their hits will be played on the big screen and the singer himself could be more excited. Boy George said: “Having played thousands of concerts worldwide, I’m thrilled that we have the technology now to allow us to bring our electrifying performances directly to the cinemas LIVE across the globe. This will be a truly amazing experience for our fans!”. The concert event will be a delayed live performance, with many participating UK cinemas offering two screenings at 5pm and 8:30pm.
