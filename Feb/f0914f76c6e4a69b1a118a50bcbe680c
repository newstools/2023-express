  The Heart Radio presenter cheekily posed in the black ensemble, which featured a plunging V-neckline and a tasteful cut-out section at her midriff. She paired the look with some shiny, matching stilettos that added inches to her slender frame. The star wore her blonde hair down, while she opted for a glamorous smokey eye makeup look. Amanda later took to the street to debut her look in view of cameras, throwing a long black coat over her shoulders as she headed from the Heart FM studio. She also tagged the look for her fans, who can recreate the ensemble by visiting fashion brands Reiss and Valentino.
