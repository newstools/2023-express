Desperate to let your hair down and do something bonkers? This randomised fun generator could be the answer. A poll of 2,000 adults found 67 percent have pledged to make some kind of change in their lives over the coming months. These targets range from “little” things like reading more books, to “big” things like moving to another job. But 64 percent believe there’s too much of a tendency to set overly serious goals – and believe greater emphasis should be on having fun. As a result, 888 Online Casino, which commissioned the research, has revealed its randomised fun generator – which will assign you a completely bananas goal for 2023. The study also found most adults (59 percent) have set themselves a goal of some sort in the past. And 33 percent of those who have done so tend to write a list of things they want to improve about themselves, and then pick one. Success, however, seems to be relatively low – as just three out of 10 goals set are achieved. But if you have hopes of doing something special this year, don’t let this revelation put you off – as almost half (46 percent) are optimistic over their aims for the next 10 months or so. And even more reassuringly, 28 percent have set themselves a goal that has led to permanent positive changes in their lives. The research, commissioned by OnePoll, found the most common aims among those polled at the moment are to exercise more, lose weight, and save more money or spend less of it.
