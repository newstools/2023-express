Job Centre workers will receive bonuses for getting people into work under a new Government scheme. The plan is part of a pilot in 60 job centres and aims to get more Universal Credit claimants into employment. The pilot will also make it compulsory for Universal Credit claimants who have been on the benefit for 13 weeks to visit a job centre every weekday for a fortnight for "intensive support". Failure to attend could lead to sanctions. An internal document seen by the BBC says Mel Stride, Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, has called for the pilot to "apply more mandatory activities to increase movement into work".   The DWP says the 13-week mark is crucial because it is at that point when a claimant's chances of getting into work decrease significantly. Under the current set-up, Universal Credit claimants usually meet with a work coach once a week for the first three months and once every two weeks after that.

Civil servants working in the Government's biggest department started 20 days of strikes earlier this month as part of a long-running dispute over pay, jobs, pensions and conditions. Members of the PCS union who work for the Department for Work and Pensions in a number of jobcentres and other offices are involved in the action. DWP staff have been offered a two percent pay increase for 2022-23, but they are demanding a rise of 10 percent.
