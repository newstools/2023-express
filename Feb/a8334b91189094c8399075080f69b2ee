King Charles's Coronation will maintain the focus on the monarch himself and his direct successors, a royal historian believes. This means Prince George, who turns 10 in July, will be seen multiple times during the historic event, author Dr Tessa Dunlop said. Appearing on the Mail+'s programme Palace Confidential, Dr Dunlop said: "You want to keep it focused on that line of succession. So we are going to see a lot of camera shots of Charles, of William, of George." During Queen Elizabeth II's Coronation, the now King Charles was only five, but was included in several shots taken inside Westminster Abbey as he stood prominently on the royal box between the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret. The Coronation will take place at Westminster Abbey on May 6. FOLLOW THIS LIVE BLOG FOR UPDATES ON THE ROYAL FAMILY
