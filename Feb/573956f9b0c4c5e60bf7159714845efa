Heather Locklear, 61, was completely ageless as she took to social media to share a rare mirror selfie in a brand new update. The Melrose Place looked cosy and comfortable in her activewear yesterday as she appeared to be enjoying a gym session. She posed alongside the elliptical machines while stunning with her natural complexion in a fresh-faced look. The TV star wore a pair of black leggings and a white hoodie, which she complemented with a nude scarf. Heather, who has previously starred on Dynasty and TJ Hooker, finished off the look by matching her platform trainers to her scarf. In the caption, Heather said: “Finally figuring out how to take photos. Can we get back to Polaroids where I look 70 years younger?”
