Amanda Holden, 51, sparked comparisons to women half her age as she took to Instagram to share two very sultry underwear snaps. The blonde bombshell, who is a JD Williams ambassador, wowed her 1.9 million followers while posing up a storm in black lace lingerie in honour of Valentine’s Day, which is fast approaching. Amanda simply captioned the post: “New @jdwilliamsuk lingerie #ValentinesDay #Ad,” alongside a black love heart emoji to match her ensemble. The Britain's Got Talent judge stunned fans in the sexy nightwear shoot, flaunting her assets and incredibly toned physique in the lingerie while lounging beside a bed. Swimwear entrepreneur Melissa Odabash commented: “Your like 25 yr old.”(sic) A fan agreed, writing: “you look better than most 20yr olds.” “How come you never seem to age!?” A third admirer questioned. It comes after Amanda was joined by fellow JD Williams ambassador Davina McCall, 55, for another Valentine’s-inspired lingerie shoot last week.
