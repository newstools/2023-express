Vladimir Putin has chillingly warned of a World War 3 "global conflict" as he issued yet another veiled nuclear threat, claiming the very existence of Russia is now at stake. The Russian President delivered an hour-long State of the Nation address, in which he launched several furious attacks against Ukraine, the West and NATO. He said: "The people of Ukraine have become the hostage of the Kyiv regime and its Western overlords, who have effectively occupied this country in the political, military and economic sense. "They intend to transform a local conflict into a phase of global confrontation. This is exactly how we understand it all and we will react accordingly, because in this case we are talking about the existence of our country." In his first direct warning during the speech, Putin said: "The more long-range Western systems are being delivered to Ukraine, the farther we will be forced to move the threat from our borders." The speech came amid fears loom Russia could launch a major new offensive in the war with Ukraine. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
