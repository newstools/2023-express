It comes as thousands of paramedics and university staff walked out in rows over pay, jobs, pensions and conditions yesterday. However 97 per cent of working adults say they have not missed work due to strike action, found the Office for National Statistics. Firefighters have accepted a seven per cent pay rise backdated to last July and a further five per cent from July this year. Network Rail and the train companies body the Rail Delivery Group made similar revised offers last month. They offered a five per cent rise, backdated to last year and a further four per cent for 2023, with no compulsory job losses until 2025. They also offered a £250 lump sum for those earning £24,000 or less. An RDG spokesperson said: “Our passengers and many hard-working RMT members will be deeply dismayed that the union leadership has opted to reject our fair proposals without putting out a vote to their full membership. “The railway’s financial crisis is not going away.” But the Rail, Maritime and Transport union’s boss Mick Lynch said: “We have carried out an in-depth consultation of our 40,000 members and the message we have received loud and clear is to reject these dreadful offers. “Our members cannot accept the ripping up of their terms and conditions or to have safety standards on the railway put into jeopardy under the guise of so-called modernisation.” Transport Secretary Mark Harper had warned it was “a best and final offer”, adding “it isn’t fair asking taxpayers to foot the bill”. Services across England and Wales ground to a halt last Wednesday and Friday.
