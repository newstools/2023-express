Maintenance worker Keving Holding, who was 60, and a father-of-three, died when he was crushed by a hydraulic pop-up urinal in London's West End. Mr Holding died after the incident at Cambridge Circus on the junction between Shaftesbury Avenue and Charing Cross Road last month.  The incident took place on January 27 outside the Palace Theatre where Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is being shown. The urinal is not connected to the theatre. Mr Holding was reportedly working on repairing an outside toilet when a hydraulic urinal “fell quite suddenly” on him. The cause of his death was identified as compression asphyxia.    A day after his death, his daughter shared a photo of him where he is holding his granddaughter on his shoulders. The photo was captioned as “She will know you as the best grandad in the whole world.” At the preliminary inquest hearing at West London Coroner's Court the court heard it took around two hours after the incident for a vehicle to help lift the urinal to arrive. CCTV footage captured the moment the Westminster City Council toilet fell, police told the initial hearing into his cause of death.
