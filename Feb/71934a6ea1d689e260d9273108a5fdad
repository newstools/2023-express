This week’s episode of the 10th season of Below Deck saw Ross McHarg finally getting some alone time with Katie Glaser after getting caught in a love triangle with Alissa Humber. After the two Bravo stars decided to make their relationship official, a debate sparked amongst fans on Twitter as some claimed Ross’s behaviour hasn’t been worthy of the deckhand’s affections. Below Deck fans have accused Ross of “gaslighting” and “toxic” behaviour during his romance with Katie. The series took a dramatic turn this week as the crew celebrated the end of their Saint Lucia charter. Ross managed to speak with Katie alone and confirmed in a confessional they had made their relationship exclusive. “I do like to play the field,” he admitted in his interview. “The field is fun. It's got long grass, it's great.” READ MORE: Denise Welch sparks uproar with Nicola Bulley comments “I don't know what qualifies you as a sex addict. I have a high libido. [But] I foresee myself having a partner for life. “I've made an active decision with Katie, that she and I are going to be just her and I.” He then quipped: “With all this love in the air, there's a good chance I might be getting laid tonight.” However, Below Deck viewers weren’t as taken by Ross’s romantic confession as Katie, with many taking to social media to beg her to reconsider. @U_cant_affordme tweeted: “Katie open your [eyes], there is NO future with Ross, all he wants is a roll in the hay. “What is wrong with you? Are you that needy you allow a dude to make you look stupid on national television?” @bravo_discourse said: “Ross is a piece of s**t. He is FOR ONCE not totally s****y to Katie on a night out and only mildly s****y and then he gaslights her into thinking she's the problem. Just gross.” “I'm bored with the Ross and Katie storyline,” @end_table admitted. “It shouldn't have started in the first place.” DON'T MISS:The Good Doctor’s Shaun faces parenting concerns in promo [VIDEO]NCIS fans emotional as Parker’s past exposed [REACTION]Vikings Valhalla star ‘literally wept’ after wrapping season three [INTERVIEW] @sihdnee wrote: “I'm sure Katie will be delighted. Now she can enjoy Ross being disrespectful in peace.” Stephanie Delasco fumed: “I’m tired of Katie and Ross. Alissa is not the problem… Ross is. “You’re not in a relationship Katie and you need to stop treating whatever you and Ross are doing like it is. Girl bye.” And she wasn’t the only one who felt some of the blame lay with Katie, with @harleydog1028 posting: “I never thought I would agree with Alissa on anything but she's right about Katie.” “She has no self-respect or worth to allow Ross to use her for sex, then gaslights when she confronts him. “He's not even that good-looking. Move on Katie. A leopard never changes their spots.” Katie’s relationship with Ross seems to have taken a turn for the better, but fans will have to tune in over the coming weeks to find out if her bosun beau can truly keep things exclusive.
