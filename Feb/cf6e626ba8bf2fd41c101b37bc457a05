Rat is also generous and will rarely ask anything of others - they are happy to do it themselves. This sign's self-assured, strong nature draws other signs in and they are not ones to show a "particular enthusiasm" for others, which makes the people around them try harder to impress. As for looks, calm Rat seldom dresses up but always looks polished, "fresh and simple". Rabbit (1951, 1963, 1975, 1987, 1999, 2011, 2023) Rabbit is usually conventionally attractive - "the women are hot while men are handsome". Men are attracted to the female Rabbit because she is "weak" and inspires their hero instinct. Gravitating towards the spotlight, "she is often the focus in the crowd and can be found easily". The male Rabbit is attractive to prospective partners because they tend to be devilishly handsome and in terms of personality, "leaves a good impression".

"Usually, they are vigorous, enthusiastic and passionate, easily drive or motivate others." People want to be around them and are usually at the very centre of a group. However, they must beware of attracting negative people who "get the sense of being or security from them". Rooster (1957, 1969, 1981, 1993, 2005, 2017, 2029) Rooster is rarely spotted looking another less than fabulous. They know how to pick an outfit which exudes "luxury". Because of this ability, other signs will often feel "inferior" to this sign, and "humbled" quickly. "Since they often succeed in business and have a certain talent in business, they are very attractive to those in lack of material safety," reported Your Chinese Astrology.
