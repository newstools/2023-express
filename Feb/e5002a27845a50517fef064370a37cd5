Super Bowl LVII MVP Patrick Mahomes apologised after dropping an F-bomb live on TV after leading the Kansas City Chiefs to victory over the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday night. The Chiefs defeated the Eagles in one of the best Super Bowls in recent years thanks to an immense performance from Mahomes. But speaking afterwards, Mahomes let his emotions get the best of him and quickly apologised after swearing live on television. Speaking to FOX Sports, the quarterback said: "We played our asses off in that second half. We found a way. I just want to thank everyone. We battled to the f****** end. Sorry for my language." His team-mate, Travis Kelce, quickly joined him and got in a few bits of blue language of his own. He said: "Not one of y'all said the chiefs were gonna take it home this year. Not one of y'all. Feel that shit. Feel it and on top of that, next time the chiefs say something, put some respect on our names." He said: "I'm not gonna say dynasty, because we're not done, so I'm not gonna say dynasty yet." Head coach Andy Reid also heaped praise on Mahomes, saying: "He's the MVP. That's all that needs to be said, right? MVP. You saw that tonight."
