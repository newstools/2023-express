Two captured Russian mercenaries claimed they signed up for the conflict in Ukraine after being told they were at war with the West. Both hardened Wagner Group fighters were recruited by the unit’s head Yevgeny Prigozhin while behind bars.  They were promised “a clean sheet” and £2,200 a-month but on Wednesday they described how they were used as worthless cannon fodder. Viktor was in the ninth year of a 20-year sentence for murder when he was persuaded to join Wagner Group. The former builder, 32, said: “We were told other countries were involved in the war in Ukraine, including Britain, and that we were defending Russia against foreign terrorists. “We were told we would not be fighting civilians, but fascists and soldiers from other countries.” Out of 5,000 Wagner Group fighters initially signed up to serve in Ukraine around 1,000 died within weeks. It is suspected as many as 50,000 were sent into battle. He said: “We’d be sent in groups of 15 against what they said were just 10 Ukrainian soldiers. Then we’d discover there were up to 40 Ukrainians.”  Even Viktor’s experience in one of Russia’s “strict regime penal colonies” did not prepare him for war. He said: “It was very frightening. I saw arms and legs being shot off in battles. It was horrible and shocking. More than 1,000 of us were killed.” Car mechanic Anatoliy, 26, had 18 months left on his three years and six months sentence for brawling when he signed up. Wearing a balaclava to hide his identity, he said: “A sniper killed 10 of my fellow troops. “Eventually I was alone, pinned down by Ukrainian forces… Wagner Group sent in another detachment of 10 men and the sniper killed five of them.” As for the future, he shrugged and added: “I can be killed, sent home or returned to Russia to fight again.”
