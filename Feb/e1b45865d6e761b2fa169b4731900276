The mum and dad of five-week-old twins in the US have been arrested after they were hospitalised with multiple broken bones, black eyes and bruising. Codi Alexander Ronald Allen, 20, and SueAnn Carter, 27, are charged with two counts of assault and four counts of endangering children, police say. The children, from Columbus, Ohio, suffered "non-accidental injuries", according to Scioto County Sheriff David Thoroughman. Mr Allen and Ms Carter were taken into custody after detectives were alerted by social workers to a case of possible child abuse, authorities said. Social workers advised that one of the twins was taken to Southern Ohio Medical Center for a possible broken arm. At that hospital, doctors noticed what appeared to be haemorrhages in the siblings' eyes. This led to both babies being transferred to the children's hospital. The parents have been charged with two counts of second degree felonious assault, four counts of endangering children. They are being held on a $340,000 bond and appeared in Portsmouth Municipal Court on Thursday. The investigation is ongoing and anyone with information is asked to contact Detective Conkle at 740-351-1091.
