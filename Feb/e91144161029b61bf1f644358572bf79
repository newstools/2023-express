A former child soldier who killed a stranger in a "ferocious" attack on London's Oxford Street has been locked up indefinitely. Tedi Fanta, 27, produced a knife on the capital's most famous high street shortly before 8pm on July 1 2021, and killed retired civil servant Stephen Dempsey. He jumped on Mr Dempsey, 60, outside a Microsoft shop and stabbed him in the chest four times. Passers-by helped restrain the attacker before armed police arrived to control the situation, with the victim rushed to hospital. He died in hospital from a chest wound later that night. Courts heard that Fanta had travelled to London from his home in South Wales, where he was already on bail for brandishing a saw. Caroline Carberry KC, prosecuting, told the Old Bailey he was seen "carrying out a ferocious, random and unprovoked attack on a helpless and unsuspecting member of the public". She added: "His victim could have been anyone who was in close proximity to him during the course of that day in central London. "Sadly for Stephen Dempsey and his family, it was him." Fanta, who suffers from paranoid schizophrenia, was deemed unfit to stand trial, with jurors not required to determine his guilt. Instead, they were tasked with ascertaining whether he committed the acts of which he was accused. They determined he had carried a knife and carried out the murder following less than an hour of deliberation at the Old Bailey earlier on Wednesday.
