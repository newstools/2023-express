A suspected knifeman was arrested in front of thousands of people demonstrating as part of the teacher strikes.Police swarmed Centenary Square in Birmingham city centre after members of the public detained the teenager.   The 18-year-old was arrested on suspicion of possessing an offensive weapon at around 12.50pm today. He remains in custody and is set to undergo a mental health assessment, reports Birmingham Live. The arrest, outside HSBC headquarters and the Library of Birmingham, shocked onlookers at the National Education Union (NEU) demo, part of nationwide strikes affecting thousands of schools. An eyewitness said: "It happened right next to the teacher demonstration in front of everyone. It was a big crowd. "I turned around and saw loads of armed cops everywhere. They moved in quickly and had his arms behind his back."  A West Midlands Police spokesperson said: "We were called to Broad Street, Birmingham, at around 12.50pm today to reports of a man with a knife. "Officers were immediately deployed to the area and a man was arrested after being detained by members of the public. "A knife was recovered nearby. The 18-year-old was arrested on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon and is currently in custody where he will undergo a mental health assessment." Thousands of teachers have gone on strike today, February 1, with around 23,000 schools impacted. Most are striking over their pay which has not been keeping pace with inflation. They are calling on the government to increase pay and improve working conditions. In England, 90.44 per cent of NEU members voted for strike action in a turnout of 53.27 per cent. Elsewhere, railway workers are striking today and Friday, February 3, with most services being cancelled and running times significantly shortened.
