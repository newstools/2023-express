On BBC's Rip Off Britain, a man explained how he feel victim to scam which not only affected him, but caused his followers to lose thousands of pounds. Alex Bosley fell victim to the so-called 'money flip' investment scam in November 2021. After a friend's glowing endorsement online of the scheme, he ended up sending £200 to the investment company via social media. The investors contacted him minutes later, telling him he had been chosen to receive a special £20,000 bonus. But in order for him to unlock it, he would have to pay a further amount -which he did. Before unlocking this £20,000 bonus, the investors asked Alex to make a video for the company, explaining his experience and how they had helped him double his money.
