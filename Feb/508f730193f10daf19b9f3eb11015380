All eyes will be on Wembley on Sunday for the League Cup final. And we’ve teamed up with William Hill to give you a £2 free bet to stake with their bet builder with Saturday's Daily Express! This match is a repeat of the 1999 FA Cup final between Manchester United and Newcastle, which Sir Alex Ferguson’s treble-winning side won 2-0 with goals from Teddy Sheringham and Paul Scholes. That was the Magpies’ last appearance in a cup final, and you have to go back to 1969 for when they last won a major trophy – the Inter Cities’ Fairs Cup. Can they end that drought in their first full season under Eddie Howe? Manchester United, meanwhile, are gunning for the first silverware of Erik ten Hag’s tenure. They can point to a decent record against the Magpies, which sees them unbeaten in the last six meetings (W4 D2).Whoever you’re backing, head to the counter of your nearest William Hill shop to redeem your £2 free bet when you pick up your Daily Express on Saturday February 25, 2023.
