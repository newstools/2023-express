Meghan Markle and Prince Harry will get a "co-star billing" at the Coronation whether they turn up or not, a royal expert has claimed. Australian commentator Daniela Elser argued the revelations and claims levelled at the Royal Family by the Duke and Duchess over the past three years and their known difficult relationship with core members of the Firm will guarantee eyes will be on them on May 6 - even if they are miles away from Westminster Abbey. In a comment piece penned for the NZ Herald, Ms Elser said if Meghan and Harry attend the Coronation, the minute the Duke and Duchess step into the London abbey the global press will be “trained on” the pair to catch their "every blink and glance at the Prince and Princess of Wales". She said, on the other hand, if they remain in California and miss the historic event, "the Sussexes’ non-attendance would set off an international media hoo-ha and take attention away from Charles and the Giant Historic Moment". Ms Elser wrote the pair would get "co-star billing" during King Charles's momentous day. THIS LIVE BLOG IS NOW CLOSED. FIND OUR COVERAGE BELOW.
