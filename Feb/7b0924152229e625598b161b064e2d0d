An easyJet pilot performed a 360-degree turn over the ocean to give all passengers a chance to see the Northern Lights. Pictures taken onboard the flight on Monday night, February 27, show the stunning hues of green, purple, and pink across the sky. Photographer Adam Groves had been returning to Manchester Airport from Reykjavik, Iceland, following an engagement weekend. He told Manchester Evening News: "We had been half expecting them as the aurora forecast was high, but low cloud cover in Iceland over the past week meant we didn’t see them from land. "We were hoping to see them while we were out there but didn’t get the chance.  "We took off and half way into the flight the pilot turned all the lights off and the view was out the left window. "We were sat on the right hand side and after two to three minutes the pilot switched back and did a 360 loop around for everyone to see." The flight path was also recorded by FlightRadar, showing the route over the ocean, and the exact spot where the plane loops in the air. Northern Lights occur as a direct result of solar activity colliding with the Earth's atmosphere. According to the Met Office, the best weather conditions to see the Lights are when the "sky is dark and clear of any clouds". They are most active during the Equinox and Solstice in March/April and September/October. People were in awe at the once-in-a lifetime opportunity; one person wrote: "Absolutely amazing. I'm that jealous I could actually cry". "Wow amazing; I wish I would've been on that plane; I would've loved to have seen the Northern Lights; well done to the pilot," said another. A third person added: "Wooow that's incredible, they were so lucky to witness that amazing moment".
