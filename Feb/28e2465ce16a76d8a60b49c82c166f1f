Dustin Poirier has brutally slammed both Conor McGregor and Michael Chandler after their big announcement was sent out on Saturday by UFC president Dana White. It was confirmed that McGregor and Chandler would be coaches for the upcoming season of The Ultimate Fighter with the two set to face each other at the end of the show on a card expected to be later this year. The fight will be McGregor's comeback bout after spending two years away from the octagon following his leg break suffered in July 2021. The bout will also be Michael Chandler's first fight since his most recent loss in November - both of their losses coming to Poirier. Dustin 'Diamond' Poirier has been on a strong run in recent years, winning eight of his last 10 fights, with his only losses coming to lightweight champions Khabib Nurmagomedov and Charles Oliveira. After seeing the announcement of McGregor facing Chandler and being featured on the next TUF series, Poirier tweeted: "TUF all my children edition". Chandler will be a tough opponent for McGregor, with the former three-time Bellator champion making waves since joining the UFC. Chandler has been involved in five incredible fights, and although he has lost three, impressed in each of them - losing to Oliveira, Poirier and Justin Gaethje. Whoever is victorious in the bout, is likely to face the winner of Kamaru Usman and Leon Edwards, with that fight for the welterweight belt taking place at the 02 Arena in London on March 19. Poirier currently has no upcoming fight scheduled, with all realistic opponents currently booked for bouts. Current champion Islam Makhachev is set to defend his belt to featherweight champion Alexander Volkanovski, who has moved up in weight to face the dangerous Russian. Also on that card, Yair Rodriguez will face Josh Emmett, with the winner set to face Volkanovski later this year for the featherweight belt.
