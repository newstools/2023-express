  Comedian Ricky Gervais, 61, shared an image with a sarcastic caption on Twitter today in view of his 15.1 million followers, as he reflected on how “cancel culture” might impact his legacy. The After Life creator discussed his fears that certain words he has used over the years might be cut in order to suit the “fragile and easily offended”.      Ricky shared a black-and-white image of himself looking pensive as he sat in an empty row of chairs. The Office creator captioned the snap: “This is me pondering whether they'll change any of the words I've used in my work after I'm dead, to spare those who are fragile and easily offended. “Words like 'fat' and 'ugly'. And 'c***' and 'f***',” he added. “And 'fat, ugly, greedy, pathetic little stupid f***ing c***'. Stuff like that.” READ MORE: Joanna Lumley apologised to Princess Anne before 'bursting into tears'     This is not the first time Ricky has hit out against cancel culture on Twitter, and his followers took to the comment section to share their thoughts on his tweet. Director and screenwriter Luis Endera wrote: “We won't let them do it.” While Kevin Higgins penned: “That ever-growing arrogance to judge forebears (and 'fix' them with agenda-driven, revisionist history).” Brandon added: “They fear the truth of the words more than the words themselves. They just can’t say that.”       “Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me,” Adam commented. Lucy replied: “If the easily offended removed everything from your work that offended them, there probably wouldn’t be much left. “The rest of us love you just the way you are!” While Ror joked: “I'd be offended if anyone was offended! I think that nullifies it.” READ MORE...

The comic, who has hosted the award show five times in recent years, has become known for aiming brutal jibes at his celebrity peers. “Looking at all the wonderful faces here,” Ricky declared in 2010, “reminds me of the great work that’s been done this year – by cosmetic surgeons.” In 2020, he decided to go out on a bang during his last stint of hosting the Golden Globes and went right for the jugular.      He started by discussing Hollywood links to the late convicted paedophile Jefferey Epstein. Ricky remarked: “In the end, he obviously didn't kill himself. Just like Jeffrey Epstein. I know he's your friend, but I don't care.” He also roasted his comedic rival James Corden by saying: “The world got to see James Corden as a fat p****y. He was also in the movie Cats, but no one saw that.” Ricky is one of Britain’s most successful comedians and writers of all time, creating shows including The Office, After Life, Extra, Derek and An Idiot Abroad.
