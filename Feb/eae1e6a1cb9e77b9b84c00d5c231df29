The Good Morning Britain presenter put on an elegant display in a stylish dress. Kate Garraway sported a gold gown that featured a thigh-high split giving a glimpse of her striking silver boots which she paired with her attire. The 55-year-old looked to be in good spirits as she posed for photos on the red carpet at the Brit Awards 2023. Kate accessorised her gorgeous attire with gold drop earrings and opted for a soft glam makeup look with a swipe of nude lipstick, while wearing her caramel tresses loose.
