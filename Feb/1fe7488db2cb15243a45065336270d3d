Anne Hathaway, 40, exuded glamour as she shimmied into the room to celebrate the Berlin International Film Festival last night. Although her dress was seemingly sheer, exposing every detail of her silhouette, it was actually a cunning illusion as the flesh-coloured fabric beneath a black patchwork pattern was opaque. The actress accessorised the dress with a pair of opera-style elbow length gloves and matching black heels. She swept her hair into a sophisticated updo, leaving only her fringe to cascade loosely down her forehead. Anne dazzled onlookers as she walked the red carpet for the opening ceremony, and took the time to promote her latest film as she did so.
