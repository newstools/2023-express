Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta says his dressing room was "absolutely bouncing" after his side came from behind twice in a statement 4-2 win on the road at Aston Villa. The Spaniard must have thought his side were heading for a draw in stoppage time with the scores level at 2-2 but Jorginho came up trumps as his long range strike flew off the bar and in off Emiliano Martinez. Gabriel Martinelli then added gloss to the scoreline with the last kick of the game after Bukayo Saka and Oleksandr Zinchenko also found the target. The win was the perfect response to the midweek 3-1 defeat to Manchester City as Arsenal went back to the top of the Premier League ahead of the champions' trip to Nottingham Forest. Arteta said on his dressing room: "It was absolutely bouncing because it was a big effort to play after the game we had less than 72 hours ago and the result [3-1 defeat to City] that was obviously morally testing. "But I am really pleased for the boys. We have to train really well on Monday."
