Last month, Zara, 41, flew to Queensland to attend the Magic Millions polo tournament as part of her role as the Racing Women Ambassador. She stayed in Australia for a week with her husband, Mike, and their three children, Mia, Lena, and Lucas. During the visit, the royal also hosted a Women with Horsepower event, which was attended by TV presenter Shelly Horton. Writing for 9Honey, Shelly described Zara as “lovely, normal and relaxed” as she sat down for lunch with her guests. She went on to recall a moment during the event when Zara spoke candidly about parenting. Shelly said: “At one point she was being interviewed on the panel and she said something like, ‘sometimes it's just a really sh**** day with the kids, and I struggle with it’. I ate every word up.” Express.co.uk spoke to parenting experts and mothers who could relate to Zara's strifes. Being a parent is no small feat and sometimes it can indeed be exhausting. Laura Crawford, who is “first and foremost a mummy” and the CEO of sustainable nappies and wipes company Mama Bamboo, agreed. She said: “Zara Tindall is absolutely correct in her assessment - some days are a total joy and others are sh****. “At every stage, your children will test you to your very limits. From new-born sleep-torture and toddler tantrums, all the way to teenage sassiness, you will cope with an emotional rollercoaster and demands on your physical being that would be unheard of in any other aspect of life - or career. “And it will affect you more deeply, for good and for bad, than anything else in your world, because you are so emotionally involved.” READ MORE: Zara and Mike are 'down-to-earth parents' - 'allow Mia to be a child' Gemma Berg, a mother-of-two and former primary school teacher who now runs Peekaboo Phonics, said she can “completely relate to Zara Tindall’s comments”. “Mum guilt is rife, especially when we are all just trying our best and our children’s behaviour can be very unpredictable and challenging. “In my experience, it can be really empowering to lean into the feeling of accepting that we had a bad day. “When I work one-to-one with my parents we often speak about how they feel if the day hasn’t gone as planned, perhaps they shouted at the children more than they wanted to or forgot to bring the packed lunch into school again - which I have also done on more than one occasion.

As parents we can feel angry, cross and fed up. “In my experience it’s healthy to communicate this with our children so they recognise that all emotions are okay - there are no good or bad emotions, it’s all about how we manage them.” Jo Mitchelhill is another mother who wants to normalise having “sh**** days with the kids” through her work as a parenting coach. She told Express.co.uk: “Some days I have sh**** days with the kids. It’s 100 percent normal and something that we should be talking about. “We live in a world where there is so much curated information on social media, where other parents portray that they are having a magical time, all the time. “We know that this isn't the case. But others don't see this and think that this is what they have to live up to. “Most of us will have times where we think, ‘I need a break. These kids are p***ing me off and today was sh**'. “Now, at some point you may want to explore why, but having the freedom to express how you are feeling is crucial to be able to make it through the day.” Jo went on to praise Zara for being so candid about parenting, saying: “We all have our limits on what we can take in a day and seeing someone like Zara be true and raw about it is brilliant because it shows that everyone feels like this from time to time, and that is okay. “Let's start normalising this,” she added. “Let's judge parents less and take the pressure off them. Let's make parents feel that what they are doing is a good thing. There is no perfect parent. Whether you are royalty or not.” Sally-Ann Tarver, a mother to an 11-year-old girl and a trichologist living in the Cotswolds, agreed that Zara’s comment was a breath of fresh air, but not at all surprising. “Every parent has sh**** child days - if you get a few non-sh**** ones, it’s a bonus. “School holidays are the worst as the break in routine makes them more s****. Those people whose children are perfect all the time are either lying or weird.”
