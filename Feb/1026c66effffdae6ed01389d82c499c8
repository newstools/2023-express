Michael (Gwithian Evans) is a smarter-than-average, chocolate-obsessed, pain-in-the-arse 23-year-old who runs rings around the nurse and doctors assigned to help him. Following the mysterious disappearance of Michael’s assigned therapist, the centre’s chief Dr Greenberg (Jon Osbaldeston) arrives to interrogate the boy while the well-meaning nurse Miss Peterson (Louise Faulkner) pops in and out to offer advice.  Clutching a toy elephant, Michael plays a series of mind games with the irascible Greenberg as he reveals with painful slowness what lies behind the mystery, hinting at sexual impropriety and forbidden patient/doctor relationships. The pachyderm in the parlour is the reason why the boy became a patient in the first place and the revelation involving a traumatising safari with his estranged father is effectively written and delivered with conviction by Evans.   It’s a short, sharp little piece that doesn’t quite merit its melodramatic finale but, at 75 minutes, it doesn’t outstay its welcome.
