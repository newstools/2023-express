Posting on the Casual UK Reddit forum, one user wrote: "I work in Greggs. What would you like to know?" The discussion thread has already garnered over 2,000 comments in just 20 hours. One query, which came out as the most popular with 572 upvotes, addressed the different pastries' patterns. The user asked: "Can you tell us the pattern on the pastry that identifies whether it’s a steak bake, chicken bake, vegetable bake, etc. Thanks."

While the worker admitted they have no power to bring back the missed items, fans refused to give up hope. "I need you to bring them back. I believe in you," begged one user. Another wrote: "Well then they'll just need to recontinue them, won't they?! Can you be our person on the inside and help us make it happen?"
