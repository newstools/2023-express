 Not-for-profit 4 Day Week Global got 61 British companies to test a more flexible shift pattern last year. Now that the trial has ended, 56 said they planned to continue with the policy for the time being. But what do you think? Are four-day weeks the future of work? Vote in our poll.     The scheme ran from June to December and included non-profits, as well as recruitment, software, and manufacturing firms. The report suggests reducing the working week to four days – providing either a mid-week day off or a three-day weekend – yielded “extensive benefits” for the companies, but especially for the well-being of their employees. Staff turnover was found to have fallen, reducing the cost of recruitment and enabling managers to invest more in training. Fewer days were also lost due to sickness, compensating somewhat for the loss of a working weekday.

While some firms offer the opportunity to work longer hours to achieve the same weekly total, this trial was about keeping 100 percent of the pay for 80 percent of the hours. As such, to break even, productivity – a long-time challenge for the UK economy – must increase by 25 percent. While most companies reported being happy with performance, those providing financial reports showed revenue had remained similar throughout the trial. According to the ADP Research Institute’s People at Work report, 71 percent of UK workers would like more flexibility over how they structure their working time. A further 53 percent reported they would accept a pay cut if it meant improving their work-life balance. But what do you think? Is a four-day working week the way forward or a non-starter?
