King Charles and Camilla, Queen Consort have been compared to garden gnomes in a savage attack on the possible future of the Royal Family. The new King and Queen are set to be crowned in May, however since the late Queen's Coronation in 1953 public opinion of the monarchy has suffered, in part due to scandals surrounding Charles himself. Writing in the Daily Mail Jan Moir said that the couple "seem like perfectly nice people" who have supported "myriad good causes", but admitted that "Charles often puts Charles first". She questioned whether Charles could command the same loyalty from the people as the "lustre and unquestioning respect" of the monarchy has given way to "suspicion and hostility". She wrote: "Charles and Camilla are about as charismatic as a couple of garden gnomes. "Can they really be trusted to carry the mantle of monarchy onwards and upwards, appealing to a new generation and deepening bonds of fealty with the public?" She added that the combination of an "unfortunate lack of magnetism" and a "changing shift in attitudes" has brought the future of monarchy into question. Queen Elizabeth was often celebrated as one of the most beloved royals of all time, with a popularity rating of 79 percent at the time of her death according toÂ YouGov. However polls carried out after the King's first few months on the throne suggest he has been doing better with the public than previously expected.
