Will there be ghosts, superheroes or aliens? Here, The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Signs director keeps his audience guessing from a brilliant first scene.  A little girl (Kristen Cui) is collecting grasshoppers in the woods when man-mountain Dave Bautista appears in a dangerously tight shirt. “I don’t talk to strangers,” says the kid when Big Dave bends down for a chat. But the charming hulk wins her round. Is he going to murder her? Is he going to help her? Will those shirt buttons hold when he eventually stands up? The questions keep coming as Dave gets the kid to spill the details about her two gay dads and the holiday cabin they’re renting nearby. It gets more tense after the girl runs to the cabin and the big man rolls up with three companions (Rupert Grint, Nikki Amuka-Bird and Abby Quinn) holding medieval-looking weapons.  After smashing their way in, they offer Daddy Eric (Jonathan Groff) and Daddy Andrew (Ben Aldridge) an ultimatum – one member of their family must commit suicide or the world will end. Are they mad? Are they prophets? This taut and reassuringly daft thriller never lets up.
