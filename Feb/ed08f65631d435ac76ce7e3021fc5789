  The Drifters singer Charlie Thomas has died at the age of 85, his pal Peter Lemongello Jr has confirmed. The music legend was previously inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame and leaves behind a lasting music legacy.     The musician died at his home in Bowie, Maryland, on January 31, Peter stated. He went on to say: "He was ageing, but he was active almost every weekend. “Unfortunately, he went from being active to being at home and he started going downhill." Charlie was best known for singing hits such as There Goes My Baby and Sweets for my Sweet.

The talented tenor lent his voice to popular tracks such as Under The Boardwalk, Saturday Night at the Movies and Up on the Roof. The group’s hit record Save The Last Dance For Me was the only song of theirs to hit No. 1 on the Billboard charts, which it did in 1960. Charlie also led vocals for No. 16 song Sweets for My Sweet in 1961 and No. 28 track When My Little Girl Is Smiling in 1962.     The second iteration of the Drifters was formed in 1959 and the up-and-coming group, led by Ben E. King, was originally named The Five Crowns. Like their name would suggest, members of both groups drifted between one another after 1965 and also went to form splinter groups. This splinter groups were headed up by various drifters, and included the likes of Charlie Thomas' Drifters and Bill Pinkney's Original Drifters. READ MORE...
