Holly has made a name for herself with the sizzling outfits she showcases on Dancing On Ice, which are worlds apart from her more demure This Morning looks - and in the past, some have been so sexy that they've even sparked Ofcom complaints. The 42-year-old was playing it safe this evening by not flashing too much flesh as she slipped on a floor length iridescent gown worthy of a Little Mermaid movie premiere. It wasn't long before she was branded the world's "most beautiful woman" by enthused fans. The presenter took to Instagram ahead of the much-awaited show to tease onlookers with a glimpse of the outfit - and, according to the dramatic reactions, it didn't disappoint. "All that glitters on Movie night at @dancingonice," she previewed in her caption, only for her 8.2 million followers to go crazy with excitement.
