In the final episode, the gang flew to the Orinoco Basin and John B (played by Chase Stokes) wanted to come up with a plan. He still didn't trust Ward Cameron (Charles Esten) after everything he had put them through, and rightly so. Meanwhile, JJ Maybank (Rudy Pankow) and Kie Carrera (Madison Bailey) landed in South America where they were reunited with the rest of the gang. Escaping new enemy Carlos Singh (Andy McQueen) and his men, Big John (Charles Halford) revealed he could not translate the Gnomon.

The gang was able to read the new clues which would lead them to El Dorado. Unfortunately, Ward had been working with Singh the whole time and had given away their location. Thankfully, they managed to make their escape, meanwhile, the rest of the Pogues located the archaeological site. An injured John B left a trail of blood for Singh to follow as he finally arrived at the cave. Once inside the dark cave, John B and Sarah Cameron (Madelyn Cline) found a hidden doorway which seemingly lead to El Dorado. As Singh tried to steal the gold from them, Big John threw a stick of dynamite in his direction. The gang escaped with the fold and it appeared Singh was killed in the explosion. DON'T MISS...
