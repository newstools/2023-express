A man has been charged with the murder of Natalie McNally who was stabbed in her home in Northern Ireland. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) confirmed a 32-year-old man was arrested on December 19 and then re-arrested on January 31. Ms McNally, 32, was 15 weeks pregnant when she was stabbed on December 18. The suspect appeared at Lisburn Magistrates Court on Thursday where he was remanded in custody. Detectives investigating the murder revealed they carried out hundreds of house-to-house inquiries and seized over 4,000 hours of CCTV footage as part of their investigation. It comes after more than 1,000 people gathered at Lurgan Park in memory of Ms McNally on Saturday. The rally, organised by the National Women's Council was attended by members of Ms McNally's family, including her parents, Noel and Bernie and brothers, Brendan, Niall and Declan. Brendan told the gathering that his sister was an inspiration to other women. It comes after more than 1,000 people gathered at Lurgan Park in memory of Ms McNally on Saturday.
