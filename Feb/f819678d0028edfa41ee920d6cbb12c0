PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium subscribers are counting down to the release of the February 2023 on-demand games. The next batch of Extra and Premium games have a February 21 release date and an estimated 10am GMT UK launch time. The February 2023 PS Plus Extra games are headlined by the excellent Horizon Forbidden West, which sees protagonist Aloy explore a beautiful but deadly post-apocalyptic world. Horizon Forbidden West will be joined by survival horror heavyweight Resident Evil 7 BioHazard, as well as interactive slasher game The Quarry. And the blockbuster releases don't stop there, with Borderlands 3 also joining PS Plus Extra in February. Borderlands will be joined by a medley of Bandai Namco games, including Scarlet Nexus, Ace Combat 7 and Tekken 7. That's on top of Earth Defense Force 5, Oninaki, Lost Sphear, I am Setsuna, The Forgotten City and Square Enix shooter Outriders. Retro gaming fans will also be pleased to hear that a selection of PSOne games are coming to the Classics line-up on PS Plus Premium. The new Classics include PlayStation RPG The Legend of Dragoon, Wild Arms 2 and Harvest Moon Back to Nature. the PS4 version of Destroy All Humans! also joins the Premium line-up in February. The Legend of Dragoon is arguably the pick of the bunch, although Wild Arms 2 and Harvest Moon are both classics in their own right. All three games are enhanced with up-rendering, and contain modern features like rewind, quick save, and custom video filters. Speaking of PS Plus, Sony is currently holding a PSN sale that greatly benefits subscribers.
