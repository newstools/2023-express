A BMW driver who killed two children when he hit them at almost 60mph in a bus lane has been jailed for nine years today. BMW driver Jack Hart had six penalty charges for using a bus lane in the previous year. He removed and destroyed dashcam evidence from the powerful car that he was driving and later lied to the police, Hull Crown Court heard. He finally changed his pleas to guilty - many months after he originally denied the matters - and he left it until the day before a trial before he formally admitted his actions, reports Hull Live. He was undertaking other vehicles in the bus lane and was driving at about 57mph in a 30mph limit when he hit best friends Steven Duffield, 10, and Mason Deakin, 11. They were on a bicycle in the same bus lane and were heading against the flow of traffic towards Hart, with Mason riding and Steven sitting on the handlebars. Hart, 32, of Anlaby Road, west Hull, admitted causing the death of Steven on October 19, 2020 and causing the death of Mason on November 2, 2020 by dangerous driving on Anlaby Road.  Best friends Steven, 10, and Mason, 11, were on a bicycle and riding along a busy stretch of Anlaby Road near the East Yorkshire buses garage when the accident happened at 6.06pm. Both boys were taken to Hull Royal Infirmary but Steven later died. Mason was kept in intensive care and had been transferred to a hospital in Leeds, where he remained in a coma and on life support. He died two weeks later, with his family by his bedside.  Judge John Thackray KC told Hart: "It's clear you caused devastation to the families of those boys in addition to the loss of life of two young boys who had their whole life ahead of them." Hart used the bus lane as his "own personal racing track", the judge added. He was banned from driving for 13 years and will have to pass an extended retest before he can drive again. Hart looked down as he left the secure dock.
