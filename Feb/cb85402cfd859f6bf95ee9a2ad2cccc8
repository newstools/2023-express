Pep Guardiola has revealed that he wanted Erling Haaland to take Manchester City’s penalty against Aston Villa rather than Riyad Mahrez. City moved within just three points of league leaders Arsenal on Sunday, convincingly beating Aston Villa 3-1. The victory for Guardiola’s side adds further intensity to the clash between the two teams on Wednesday night, with a victory meaning his team can finally return to the top of the table. Rodri thundered home a header after just four minutes at the Etihad Stadium to give the home side the lead before Ilkay Gundogan continued his good form against Villa in the 39th minute. Jack Grealish then won a penalty against his former side on the cusp of halftime, and several stars stepped forward in hope of adding to their respective goal tallies. Rodri, Haaland and Mahrez were all hopeful of taking the spot kick before captain Gundogan intervened to rule that the latter would step up. The former Leicester City star coolly sent Martinez the wrong way, though Guardiola has announced that he would rather Haaland had stepped up. Speaking after the match, he said: “I like when people want to take penalties but always there is one that is the main one and that is Erling." Asked about what he made of the situation by Sky Sports, the former Barcelona boss continued: “I don’t know. I need to talk to them. Usually, Erling [Haaland] is the first taker, Riyad [Mahrez] is the second one, Rodri was involved. I saw it from the touchline so we will see what they say tomorrow.”
