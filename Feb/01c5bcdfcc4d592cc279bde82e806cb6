Day two of F1 pre-season testing is underway with Lewis Hamilton out early in a bid to plug the gap to Max Verstappen. The Mercedes star was around seven-tenths slower than the Dutchman on day one in Bahrain as cars returned to action after the winter break. However, teams are mainly focussing on reliability with performance gains set to come later in the three-day test. Hamilton will be behind the wheel this morning while George Russell will get behind the cockpit this afternoon. Sergio Perez will start off Red Bull's running before Max Verstappen concludes his pre-season testing later today after enjoying eight hours on Wednesday.
