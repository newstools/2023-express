The Los Angeles Lakers are keen to acquire Kyrie Irving after the superstar point guard made his intentions clear that he wants to be traded before Thursday's deadline. After Thursday, no trade deals will be able to go through until after the playoffs, and Irving is believed to be desperate to secure a move before that point, having been unhappy with the contract offer made by Brooklyn. The All-Star guard had given the team an indication that he had wanted to re-sign, which led to Brooklyn offering him a contract, though that deal featured a stipulation which Irving was 'vehemently against', eventually leading him to asked to be moved. After being linked with Irving last season the Lakers, naturally, have been earmarked as the most likely landing spot for him in a blockbuster deal which would see Russell Westbrook, draft picks and potentially more players go the other way. Whilst the Lakers will no doubt be willing to make a deal happen as they continue to struggle in the 12th spot in the western conference and three wins outside of a playoff spot, but they have already made it known that they are not willing to give up two of their players. Johan Buva from The Athletic claimed the Lakers would most likely have to offer up two first-round picks as well as players, something the Lakers seem uneasy about. If they were to keep either of their picks, the Lakers would apparently have to give over either Austin Reaves or Max Christie. The Lakers are believed to be against dealing either.  It would be a surprise to see the Lakers be willing to miss out on Irving because of two players who have yet to truly carve out a meaningful role on the team, but the two youngsters are clearly seen as exciting prospect. The Lakers also know that they need to keep a hold of young talent, after going numerous seasons without first round draft picks after trading them to acquire the likes of Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook.
