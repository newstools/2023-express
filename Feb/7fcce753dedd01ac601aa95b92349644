Fans of James Bond have the chance to snap up “the most extensive collection” of 007 film scripts, screenplays and storyboards – for £375,000. Highlights of the 120 items include the earliest draft version of the first Bond film Dr No and an undeveloped Moonraker screenplay scripted by author Ian Fleming in 1956.  Also included is the final legal screenplay of 2014’s Spectre, original storyboards for some of Bond’s most iconic scenes, and signed used scripts. The sale is being held to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the creation of James Bond, who debuted in the 1953 book Casino Royale. London book dealers Peter Harrington will oversee the deal. The firm’s Pom Harrington said: “When it comes to collectables related to James Bond, this collection is unparalleled.” The collection will be showcased at the California International Antiquarian Book Fair next week.
