This stunning £4.5million waterfront mansion is the star prize in the country’s biggest ever house draw. The six-bedroom property on Cornwall’s Fowey Estuary also has a yoga studio and its own river mooring.  Whoever wins the Omaze Million Pound House Draw, which supports the Marie Curie charity, will also have their stamp duty and legal fees covered. They will receive £100,000 cash to help them move in – or they may rent the house out or even sell it.  Steps singer Claire Richards, an ambassador for Marie Curie, said: “The partnership between Marie Curie and Omaze is raising vital funds for a charity that plays such a crucial role for people affected by terminal illness.”  The three-storey home has stunning views. Furnishings are included too.
