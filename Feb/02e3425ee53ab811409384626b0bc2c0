Floyd ‘Money’ Mayweather is widely considered to be one of the greatest boxers of all time and was revolutionary both inside and outside of the ring. An astute businessman, Mayweather famously bought himself out of his promotional contract with Top Rank for £630,000 ($750,000) and went on to run his own career. Over the course of a stellar 50-0 professional run, he racked up big payday after big payday. TBE claims he made £630m ($750m) in his three fights with Canelo Alvarez, Manny Pacquiao and Conor McGregor alone. But he hasn’t stopped there. Since retiring from professional boxing in 2017, Mayweather has continued to compete in lucrative exhibition bouts against YouTubers, kickboxers and everything in between. He now boasts £375m ($450m) in net worth and has one of the most lavish lifestyles in all of sport. Here, Express Sport takes a look at Mayweather’s most prized assets from jets, houses and supercars – and lifts the lid on his polyamorous relationship. Mayweather owns two private jets, a £50m Gulfstream G650 jet, dubbed Air Mayweather, which he bought as a birthday present for himself in 2018 and a second jet worth £25m for his entourage to follow in. Both planes can fit up to 12 passengers and have his The Money Team (TMT) logo printed on their sides along with the boxing legend’s undefeated 50-0 professional boxing record. Mayweather has a fleet of supercars worth over £20m including five Rolls-Royces worth over £2m, a Ferrari 488 worth around £238,000 and a Mercedes-Maybach valued at £172,000. He's also been pictured inside of a Bugatti Chiron which has a market value of £2.82m and a £140,000 Mercedes G-Wagon. Mayweather claims he has over 100 cars in his collection. Mayweather owns two mansions in Los Angeles and Las Vegas after recently parting ways with his third, a beach house in Miami, for £5.3m ($6.6m). His 25,000 square foot LA crib is worth over £21m ($25m) and has six bedrooms, 10 bathrooms, a pool, multiple drawing rooms, dining rooms and a huge back garden. Meanwhile, his Vegas pod valued at £8.5m ($10m) is just as impressive with 11 bedrooms, 14 bathrooms, multiple guest houses, a massive courtyard and his famous 20-car underground garage. Mayweather is a self-professed lady’s man and has had many girlfriends over the years. He is an advocate of polygamy and likes to date multiple women at one time. Many believe this is the reason his ex-fiancé, Shantel Jackson, left him. His current girlfriend is model Lisa Hernandez, who previously dated former LA Lakers owner Jerry Buss. Hernandez has previously linked up with other well-known celebrities including players on the Lakers squad.
