A third of Britons have no idea that Sir Winston Churchill was Prime Minister in the Second World War, a poll shows. And 37 per ent are clueless about when the war took place, with nearly half unaware that Hitler’s invasion of Poland started it and that there were nearly 60 million casualties globally.  Around 40 percent are unsure which countries ultimately emerged victorious or what the Blitz was – oblivious to the fact it was a German bombing campaign against the UK that occurred in 1940 and 1941. And 30 percent have no idea that a US atomic bomb was used on the Japanese ­cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. The study, by OnePoll, also found more adults learnt about the conflict from documentaries (64 percent) and films (59 percent) than school (55 percent). Comedian and Second World War expert Al Murray said: “It’s important that we improve our knowledge and prevent the harsh lessons that were learnt during that war from being forgotten.”
