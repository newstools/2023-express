Manchester United will still be enjoying the aftermath of their impressive victory over Barcelona to reach the Europa League quarter-finals this morning after Erik ten Hag's side produced another statement performance. And in the context of the club's takeover bid process, it will only make the club appear more valuable to its prospective new owners. The Red Devils remain in the hunt for four trophies, something the club's fans would have been dreamed about at the start of the season. And while the chances of winning a quadruple are slim, a first trophy in six years is very much achievable. Nothing would be better to demonstrate to the new owners this is a club worth investing in and there is certainly interest, with US firm Ares Management - estimated to have assets worth Â£245 billion ($295bn) - prepared to enter the race to provide funding for a bidder. That could be crucial in trying to land a player of Jude Bellingham's quality, with the Borussia Dortmund starlet wanted by Ten Hag. As it stands, Qatar's bid led by Sheikh Jassim Bin Hamad Al-Thani and Sir Jim Ratcliffe's INEOS are the leading parties involved. But that could still change in the coming days as the Glazers weigh up bids with US firm Raine, who are handling the sale. Follow LIVE updates below...
