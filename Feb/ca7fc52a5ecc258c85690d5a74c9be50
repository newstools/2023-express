The mural depicted a 1950s woman in an apron and washing-up gloves pushing a man into a freezer. This was surrounded by a number of items, including a glass bottle, broken chair, and a frying pan. Staff from Thanet Council originally removed the freezer, leaving behind a bare wall, before reinstating it after realising it was part of a Banksy work. However, shortly after, the freezer was removed again along with items around the mural. The council said it wasn't behind the decision to remove the freezer for a second time.

Chief executive of the gallery, Julian Usher, said: “There were other items forming part of this art installation. We believe they included a frying pan with red paint on it, then a bottle and a chair. “We have a contact from an unknown person offering the frying pan for sale and we will consider securing that. Regarding the chair and bottle, it is unlikely and probably on balance, deemed unnecessary.” Mr Usher added: “We have the freezer secured and in storage. It is a shame that a local was quick to remove an item, but it won’t affect what the owner wishes to achieve. “The mural, which is on the side of a house, is set to be cut away from the building by structural engineers so it can eventually be moved to a permanent home.” The owner of the building to which the mural is attached has said they want domestic abuse charities to benefit from any money raised from the sale of the artwork. Until a new home is found for the artwork, it has been covered by plastic sheets to protect it.
