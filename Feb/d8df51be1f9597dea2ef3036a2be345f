   Mandy Walker, 60, who is the brilliant cinematographer behind Baz Luhrmann’s new biopic, Elvis, described how glad she was that the singer’s late daughter Lisa Marie Presley had been “happy” with the film. Lisa Marie Presley sadly died at the age of 54 on January 12 after suffering a cardiac arrest.     Speaking exclusively to Express.co.uk at the BAFTA Awards, Mandy spoke about the Presley family and how much love they have had for the new Elvis movie. Elvis sadly died in 1977 and was survived by his wife Priscilla Presley and, until this year, his only daughter Lisa Marie. “I feel immensely sad for the Presley family after what happened to Lisa Marie,” Mandy confirmed. “But I feel like she and her mother were really happy with the movie, and Riley and her children.” READ MORE: Tom Kerridge sets record straight as Si King fronts event without Dave    Riley Keough is the daughter of Lisa Marie and Cabin by the Lake actor Danny Keough.

We’re meeting up after not seeing each other for about a year.” Speaking about trying to provide a fresh perspective on Elvis’ story, she explained: “I think there was the responsibility both ways to represent the historical music and concerts that everybody knows and can watch online and people that remember. “But also to introduce a new audience and I wanted them to feel like they were in a concert and to feel like they were watching the real Elvis. Mandy went on to gush about Austin Butler, who plays the rock and roll star in the critically-acclaimed movie.      “Austin Butler is incredible and as well as just being a really lovely person he’s an amazing collaborator and a really hard worker and we managed to dance with him. “The important part of the movie was that we were all in sync and I felt that it was always there and he was always in great spirits and a team player.
