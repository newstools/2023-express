 Harry Styles, 29, and Taylor Swift, 33, have re-incited fervor in their fanbases as they had an adorable but somewhat awkward encounter at the Grammy Awards on Sunday night. The two musicians briefly dated 10 years ago, with their short lived romance reportedly providing some writing fuel for the songstress. As Jennifer Lopez announced Harry had won the Best Pop Vocal Album award, Taylor seemingly leaped to her feet to give the artist a standing ovation. Later in the evening, as Harry performed his hit song As It Was, the songstress was seen to be one of the only people standing and dancing to the music in the crowd. Taylor’s seemingly awkward fawning over Harry may have been prompted by Grammy host Trevor Noah, who opened the show by labeling the Cinema singer a “sex symbol”. At the end of the night, the former One Direction band member took home two of the six awards he was nominated for while Taylor received her first Best Music Video award for a video which she directed.
