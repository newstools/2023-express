It's a worrying time for UK broadband users with many of Britain's biggest Internet Service Providers (ISPs) announcing record-breaking price rises. Most of these massive increases will come into force in the spring with some customers being hit by hikes in excess of 14 percent. That will means a broadband user currently paying £60 per month will see their outgoings rise to more than £68 overnight. Anyone affected will be warned about their new bills in the coming weeks and that means now could be a very good time to shop around. As long as you are not tied into a long-term deal you should be able to leave your current ISP without facing any penalties and there are plenty of discounts available including one deal that's offering totally free access. Yes, Three Mobile has launched an incentive - that includes its 4G or 5G router - and it won't cost a penny to use for the first three months. That means you can join today with your first direct debit leaving your account in May/June. Another great thing about this broadband is there's no fussy setup with Three simply sending out the mobile-connected router and users then plugging it for instant access to the web.
