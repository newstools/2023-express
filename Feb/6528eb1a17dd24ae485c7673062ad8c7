  Amanda left her BGT pals in fits of giggles when she realised the microphone she was wearing had slipped too low while she was making her way over to the judging panel. The Heart Radio host, who looked stunning in a pink long-sleeved bodycon dress, went on to reveal that the mix on her back had fallen down into a rather unexpected place. The star expressed a mock look of horror as she hastily grabbed her dress, as the audience burst out laughing. Hosts Ant McPartin and Declan Donnelly also appeared to find the whole thing hysterical as Amanda reached across to grab the mic on the judging desk. “Say no to crack!” she joked. “Literally, my mic pack has gone right down my bum. You'll be hearing all kinds of interesting noises.”
