Adele Adkins, 34, was prepared to sweep the floor last night in Los Angeles, both with her incredible number of nominations and gorgeous ruby dress. The singer delivered classic Hollywood glamour at the event and found herself tied with Brandi Carlile as the third most nominated artist of the evening. Her velvet Louis Vuitton gown, featuring a wide-ruffled neckline and small train, wowed viewers as they spotted the singer inside the event. The Rolling In The Deep star had elected to forego a red carpet entrance to the event, sparking some concern among fans as a rumour earlier this year claimed the singer would not appear at all. After a six-year break from attending the awards show, the Tottenham-born singer went home with the Best Pop Solo performance for her hit song Easy On Me.
