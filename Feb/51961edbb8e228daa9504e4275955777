An estimated one million drivers on Britain’s roads will be over the age of 85 by 2025, leading to some motoring groups calling for a change to protect elderly motorists. But do you think those over 85 years old should have to surrender their licence? Vote in our poll. Drivers over 70 are required to renew their driving licence every three years instead of 10. The DVLA will contact motorists 90 days before their 70th birthday. However, there is no upper age limit for motorists or mandatory health or fitness tests to complete. There are some 134,000 drivers over the age of 90 on the road in the UK, while the number of drivers over 70 has almost doubled since 2012 to around 5.7 million. Older Drivers Task Force said it is “vital” the UK is ready to “prepare for this demographic change”.

That seems draconian, given that there are bad drivers and good drivers at every age. But the Government will need to confront the issue at some point given the demographic factors that are slowly but surely putting more elderly drivers on the road.” So what do YOU think?
