Philadelphia Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni was left in tears by the performance of the national anthem at Super Bowl LVII. Sirianni was shown on the big screen struggling to fight back tears as Chris Stapleton performed. Once things got going, the Eagles made a quick start, scoring on their first drive. They thought they'd managed to get a touchdown after running into the end zone, but after a review, it was determined thatÂ Kenneth Gainwell's elbow hit the turf just one yard short. They quickly got back to the line of scrimmage and quarterback Jalen Hurts performed a quarterback sneak to get the Eagles on the board early in the first quarter, leading 7-0 after just two minutes of the game.
