China has said a suspected spy balloon spotted flying above the US is a "civilian" airship which strayed from its scheduled route. The white circular object, sighted on Thursday aboveÂ three nuclear missile silo fields at an air force base, is believed by US intelligence to be a "high-altitude surveillance" device. Beijing now claims it is used for scientific research, "such as meteorology".  However, Secretary of State Antony Blinken has postponed a high-profile visit to China, planned for this weekend, as tension rises between the two superpowers. In a statement on Friday, China's Foreign Ministry said the airship "is of a civilian nature, used for scientific research such as meteorology". "Affected by the westerly wind and with limited self-control ability, the airship seriously deviated from the scheduled route," it said. "China regrets that the airship strayed into the United States due to force majeure."   Blinken has reportedly postponed his trip until the situation is resolved. Express.co.uk has approached the State Department for comment.
