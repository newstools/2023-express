A man was left furious after he was forced to take six bags of rubbish to the dump after the binmen casually dropped them on the floor close to his rat-infested property. David Jackson says he was well aware the council ordered residents not to overload their bins.   However, the 54-year-old claims his bins were missed last Wednesday, February 8. The dad-of-three told Yorkshire Live: "I have lived here for seven years and have had problems with bin collections going back to 2021 and more recently last year when the council claimed there were problems with parked cars not allowing their vehicles to get round to us. "But this morning takes the biscuit! I'd had to put the extra bags on top of the wheelie bins as they missed last week. "I was asleep when they called but when I checked my CCTV I couldn't believe what they had done. "Since Covid we have had problems with rats in the area so there was no way I could leave the bags there so I had to take them to the tip myself. "I'm not happy about it as it means I'm effectively doing their job for them." Councillor Naheed Mather, Cabinet Member for Environment, said: "Our team is aware of the missed collection on Buley Road, as they regularly encounter access issues such as double-parked cars meaning our wagons are unable to make the scheduled collections. "On this occasion, our team were unable to make the scheduled collection on Wednesday, 8 Feb. "A replacement collection, which was scheduled before the end of the week, was also unsuccessful due to the same access issues. "A second attempt at a catch-up collection was scheduled for today and was successful. "Now that the missed bin has been collected, there should be space in the grey bins to contain the waste created in the past week, with enough remaining space to last until next weekâ€™s scheduled collection. "We ask all residents where ever they park their vehicles to consider access for other road users as well as bin wagons and emergency service vehicles."
