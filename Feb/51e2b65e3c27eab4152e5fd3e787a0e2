Prince Harry will have to "watch on as Camilla’s family steal the limelight", a commentator argued following claims the Queen Consort's grandchildren will play a role during the Coronation. Royal expert Daniela Elser claimed in an op-ed this is the latest sign the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have been pushed to the sidelines of the Royal Family following their decision to step down as working Firm members, with no active role despite Harry being the son of the King and fifth-in-line to the throne. Ms Elser wrote in a comment piece for the NZ Herald: "Harry might be the King’s son and fifth in line to the throne but now, having turned his litany of family grievances into a highly lucrative one-man cottage industry, on Coronation day he looks set to play much the same role as one of Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie’s artfully perched chapeaus – ornamental and nothing more." After referring to reports the Duke is unlikely to receive the apologies he was hoping for from his family and, given the low popularity among Britons he risks being booed, Ms Elser added: "The Sussexes will now have to watch on as Camilla’s family steal the limelight, a nation’s hearts and millions if not billions of clicks and likes."
