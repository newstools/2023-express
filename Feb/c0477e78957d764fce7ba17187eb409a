A boy was dragged to the floor and bitten by a dog near a school. The 12-year-old was left with "cuts and bruises" to his stomach following the attack on January 24 at around 2pm, which required emergency treatment. The boy's relative initially made a post on Facebook about the incident which took place outside a school in Loughborough, Leicestershire, pleading with others to come forward, reports Leicestershire Live. The post read: "My nephew, age 12, was attacked by a Rottweiler dog outside Limehurst high school. "He was seriously injured and cut as the dog dragged him to the ground, shaking him, causing cuts and bruises to his stomach and body needing emergency treatment. "The man ran off after the dog attack and left my nephew there on the floor on his own scared crying for help, and he ran off." Following enquiries by Leicestershire Police, they have today released a CCTV image of someone they would like to speak with regarding last month's incident. The police are looking for dog walkers in the area to come forward with information regarding the man pictured, as well as asking the man himself to come forward. PC Sam Parr, the investigating officer, said: "I would like to speak to the man pictured about this incident, as I believe he may have information that could assist my investigation. "I’m appealing to dog walkers who frequent the area where it happened and may recognise him from the clothes he’s wearing or the dog that's with him. "I’m also appealing directly for the man to get in touch." You can pass on information by visiting www.leics.police.uk and quoting reference 23*48818. Alternatively you can call 101.
