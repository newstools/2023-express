The iPad might rule the roost but it's about to get another new rival that's powered by Android. OnePlus, which has long been shaking up the market with its flagship killing smartphones, is now turning its attention to tablets and this latest device from the Chinese firm is definitely one to watch out for. It's called the OnePlus Pad and it features a speedy processor, a 14-hour battery life and some impressive Dolby Atmos audio to make content sound like you're in the cinema. Those wanting a nightly Netflix binge will also be treated to an 11.61-inch screen featuring Dolby Vision and it even features a pretty epic 144Hz refresh rate - that's even faster than Apple's super-premium iPad Pro. OnePlus is promising that this display will make gaming appear smoother and reading books much easier on the eyes. Other features coming to the OnePlus Pad include 67W SUPERVOOC charging for speedy refilling and it's made from aluminium alloy to give users a premium feel. That build quality should also help it survive life on the road. Just like Apple's tablets, owners will be able to add accessories including the OnePlus Stylo digital and the OnePlus Magnetic Keyboard which turns the tablet into a mini laptop. “We believe the Internet of Things is the future, and users will demand fast, smooth and streamlined experiences in multiple scenarios,” said Kinder Liu, President and COO of OnePlus. “By entering the tablet industry, we hope the unique and industry leading OnePlus fast and smooth experience will bring more vitality and possibility and offer users the best choices.” There's no word on pricing just yet but we do expect this device to launch in Europe later this year. We're also waiting to find out if the stylus and keyboard will be bundled as part of the tablet or if owners will need to pay extra. Hopefully, more news will be revealed soon. Along with announcing its new tablet, there's also a new smartphone on its way called the OnePlus 11 5G. This call maker gets a whole swathe of upgrades including the very latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor which not only makes it far more powerful but also extremely efficient for longer battery life. Even when things do run flat there's 100W SUPERVOOC compatibility which can take things from flat to full in just 25 minutes. Other extras coming to the OnePlus 11 include a 6.7-inch 2K 120Hz Super Fluid AMOLED Display and there's a triple-lens rear camera that's powered by technology from the experts at Hasselblad. As the name suggests, it's fully 5G compatible and comes in two colours - Titan Black and Eternal Green The OnePlus 11 5G will go on sale on 16 February at OnePlus.com and Amazon and will start from £729 for the 8+128GB variant and £799 for the 16+256GB model.
