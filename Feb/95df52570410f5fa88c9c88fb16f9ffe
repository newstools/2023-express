Naby Keita is reportedly 'on the verge' of leaving Liverpool for free ahead of the summer transfer window with the Reds expected to overhaul their midfield options. Thiago Alcantara is still Liverpool's only senior midfield signing since the summer of 2018 with the club taking on heavy criticism for not changing things up, particularly due to their struggles this season. Keita was one of the new arrivals back in 2018 to plenty of fanfare and for a huge fee. But he's struggled to impress throughout his time at Anfield with numerous fitness issues curtailing his progress. Now 27 years of age, Keita is out of contract at the end of the season and is expected to be moved on. He's now moved behind young Stefan Bajcetic in the pecking order at Liverpool with Jurgen Klopp currently trying to find a formula to get things going again at the troubled club. Keita is free to talk with clubs outside of England ahead of the summer transfer window due to his contract expiring soon. And it looks as though the midfielder is close to leaving Merseyside.   Fabinho's future is coming under scrutiny as well with the Brazilian struggling to rediscover his best form. Liverpool are expected to sign at least two new central midfielders this summer with Jude Bellingham the top target. It will likely take a bid in excess of Â£100million to win the race for Bellingham's signature while Liverpool are also being linked with moves for the likes of Sofyan Amrabat, Matheus Nunes and Moises Caicedo. But Klopp will need a lift in his squad before then with Liverpool currently down in 10th in the table and 11 points adrift of the Champions League spots. They're yet to win in the Premier League in 2023 with big defeats against Brentford, Brighton and Wolves.
