Kansas City Chiefs star Patrick Mahomes was left wincing on the sidelines after appearing to re-aggravate his injured ankle. The NFL Most Valuable Player suffered a high-grade ankle sprain during the Divisional Round. Mahomes was taken down while attempting to rush for a first down with just minutes left of the first half of Super Bowl LVII. The Chiefs quarterback appeared to twist his right ankle on the turf under the pressure of the tackle. He hobbled on his way back up to his feet and was clearly in pain as he waddled back to the sidelines for treatment. Once on the bench, he threw his head back and appeared to slam his helmet down in frustration. The NFL MVP suffered a high grade ankle sprain during the NFL Divisional Round, and head coach Andy Reid even suggested this week that he didn't believe his star man would be 100% ready to play. He enjoyed a good start to the game, but that all changed just after the two-minute warning.
