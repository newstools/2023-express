A new law will require voters to bring formal ID with them to polling stations from May onwards. The Elections Act 2022, which passed through parliament last year, was introduced to reduce voter fraud, despite low records of such crime. But do you support the UK’s decision to enforce voter ID? Vote in our poll. The national rules will be first used at local elections on May 4, and require Britons to give their polling clerk their name and address, as before, and also show a form of photographic ID. Acceptable forms of ID include a British passport, driver’s licence, over 60s bus pass and a disabled driver's blue badge. Voter ID has been common practice in Northern Ireland since 2003, yet there are fears by some pro-democracy organisations that the new laws could lead to “chaos” at polling stations. The Electoral Commission reports that as many as two million voters could be disenfranchised as they do not hold a valid form of ID.

He continued: “Not only is the Tory voter ID plan completely unworkable, it is unnecessary and set to lock millions of people out of voting. “The Conservatives have got their priorities all wrong. During a cost of living crisis when people are struggling to make ends meet, it is an outrage that they would rather spend money on disenfranchising them.” A Government spokesperson said the “vast majority of eligible voters” already had accepted ID, and those without had until April 25 to apply for free. They added: “We are pleased that so many people have applied within the first two weeks and will continue to work with the Electoral Commission to ensure all voters are aware of the new requirement.” So what do YOU think?
