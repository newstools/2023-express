Princess Anne left a councillor in stitches today as she visited Southampton. The Princess Royal was pictured making the Lord Mayor of Southampton burst out laughing as she honoured the councillor’s appointment as the city’s first ever Lord Mayor.  Princess Anne met Councillor Jacqui Rayment at the Southampton Civic Centre in Southampton shortly after midday. She honoured Ms Rayment’s appointment infront of the Letters Patent which signified the city’s new Lord Mayor Status. The status was approved by Queen Elizabeth II as part of the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee Civic Honours competition. Princess Anne said: "The fact that you’ve been celebrating 800 years and 800 mayors, it seems only appropriate that you should have a Lord Mayor.

Before leaving the Centre, Anne also unveiled the City Champion plaque given to the local council in recognition of the work it had done as part of the Queen’s Green Canopy initiative during the Jubilee. The last time Princess Anne visited the city was in 2009. Her day in started with a visit to Princess Anne Hospital, which she opened back in 1981.  As part of the event, organised by the Royal College of Midwives to mark its 42-year anniversary, Anne spoke to families. She also met with a baby who was born in the early hours of today (February 03). Talking to the Daily Echo, Rayment said: "I think it's a real privilege, and I am humbled to have received the award today of the Letters Patent." "She seemed very interested. "She spoke to a wide range of people from across the city, which I think is lovely."
