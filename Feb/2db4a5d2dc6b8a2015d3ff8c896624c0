Lily Rose Depp, 23, channelled her inner Kate Moss as she slipped into a replica of the supermodel's famous "naked" dress, while also posing with a cigarette in hand. Lily's father, Johnny, dated Kate from 1994 to 1997, with the model even making an appearance during the Hollywood actor's publicised trial against his ex-wife Amber Heard. The Pirates of the Caribbean star's eldest child copied Kate's iconic 1993 look, donning a modern version of the gown by Martin Keehn. Kate was only 19 when she attended the Elite Models party in the sheer number by Liza Bruce that flashed her knickers and assets. Despite the show stopping number, many took to the Instagram comments to weigh in on Lily's "strange" decision to pay homage to her dad's ex-girlfriend.
