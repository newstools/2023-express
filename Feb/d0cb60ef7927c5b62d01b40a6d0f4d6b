An attacker beat up a man waiting for their taxi outside a Bongo’s Bingo in what is being described as an unprovoked, homophobic attack. The attacker broke the victim’s jaw and threw offensive slurs at the man who had been attending the boozy event at Monaco Ballroom in Hindley, Wigan. The victim is still receiving support for the attack which took place on Saturday 10 December at around 11pm. Police are now appealing for information on the incident, and are looking for a man in connection with the attack to help them with their enquiries along with two women who may have witnessed the incident. Police Constable Alex Wright, of Greater Manchester Police’s Wigan district said: "We are now appealing for anyone who may have seen what happened or who may know who this person is as well as helping us identify the other people described so they can assist with our investigation. "After conducting a number of enquiries since the incident was reported shortly after it happened, we are now in a position to ask for the help of the public into what was a serious assault we believe may have been of a homophobic nature.
