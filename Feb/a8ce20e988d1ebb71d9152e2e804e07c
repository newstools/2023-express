The biggest night of the year in music took place on Sunday evening with the likes of Doja Cat and Bebe Rexha walking the red carpet at the 65th Grammy Awards ceremony. Doja Cat stunned in a black latex Versace gown, highlighting her gym-honed curvaceous figure. She paired this with matching latex gloves and black hoop earrings, while also keeping on theme with striking black eye makeup. While Lizzo was sure to turn heads as she made an entrance in a vibrant orange gown and matching cape by Dolce and Gabbana. The dress, which was a lighter shade of orange, featured a corset bodice adorned with crystal stripes.
