McDonald's will take down an advert for its 'McCrispy' chicken burger after it was placed next to a sign for a crematorium. Locals in Truro, Cornwall, couldn't believe their eyes when they saw the ad placed at a bus stop opposite Penmount Crematorium. The advert for the burger was shown on a large billboard, and sparked a lot of debate among Truro residents online. Some furious lcoals branded the advert "tasteless" while others decided to see the funny side. One woman, whose mother-in-law was cremated at the establishment last year, said: "Although I can see the funny side, it is tasteless and I'm sure some grieving family members won't like to see it when visiting Penmount for the funeral and cremation of a loved one." Another person said that "how funny it is will probably depend on how long ago you followed the crematorium sign wearing a black tie." Some said they found the positioning of the billboard hilarious. Another commenter said they "fell off the chair laughing" while one joker made the classic "I'm lovin' it" pun, referring to McDonald's slogan. McDonald's have said that they are taking the matter seriously and will look into taking the advert down. They said in a statement: "We were unaware of the road sign in the vicinity of this bus stop. However, in light of the concerns raised by CornwallLive, we have asked for our advertisement to be removed." Cornwall Council, which runs the crematorium and owns the bus shelter, said it was unable to comment on the matter.
