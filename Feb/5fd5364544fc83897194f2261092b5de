FortniteÂ fans are getting ready for the release of update 23.40 on PlayStation consoles, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, Android and PC. The good news is that the new update will add new gameplay features and make countless bug fixes. The bad news, however, is that update 23.40 will be accompanied by a period of server downtime, which is likely to last for at least a couple of hours. If you want to know when you can start logging back into Fortnite, check out the 23.40 downtime schedule below. Fortnite update 23.40 will be available to download from 9am GMT UK time on the morning of February 14. Matchmaking will begin to be disabled at 8.30am, while servers will be taken offline in full at 9am GMT. The news was announced by Epic Games on Twitter, alongside a preview of what fans can expect from update 23.40. "Prepare to break open the vault tomorrow with Update v23.40!" reads an Epic tweet. "Downtime begins at 4 AM ET, with matchmaking being disabled shortly before." If it's anything like previous periods of server downtime, then Fortnite is likely to come back online at around 11am GMT. Express Online will keep this article updated with all the latest developments, including confirmation on when the game is back online. Based on Epic's tweet and recent leaks, it looks like update 23.40 could introduce some kind of most wanted criminal system, or maybe even a vault heist. That's on top of the usual array of new skins, not to mention additional augments, new quests, unvaulted items and lots more. Epic will also add the second School of Llama Path, which rewards players with the Geralt of Rivia Lobby Track on completion. Finally, expect a whole list of gameplay tweaks and bug fixes, including updates to fix various skins.
