There are several bank holidays in April and May this year including the Easter weekend with Good Friday on April 7 and Easter Monday on April 10. There is also an extra bank holiday for the coronation of King Charles III. People who receive benefits, such as Universal Credit, PIP or Pension Credit, may want to note when the bank holidays and if their payments may be affected as a result. Anyone expecting a payment on one of the Easter bank holidays will get their payment early, on April 6, the day before Good Friday. A person’s benefits are usually paid directly into their nominated bank or building society account. Those who have a payment date on a weekend or bank holiday will usually be paid the last working day before.
