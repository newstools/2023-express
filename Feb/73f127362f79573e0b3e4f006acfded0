Wrexham CEO Fleur Robinson has confirmed the National League side opened up a new gym at the club's training ground due to complaints from team owner Rob McElhenney in the 'Welcome to Wrexham' series. Investment from Hollywood duo Ryan Reynolds and 'Always Sunny in Philadelphia' creator McElhenney has completely transformed the Welsh minnows, and made them household names on both sides of the pond. The Disney+ show 'Welcome to Wrexham' gave a peek behind the curtain on the pair's first year as owners, and included a hilarious moment in which McElhenney sees the team gym for the first time. Upon walking in on the tiny room with a few dumbbells, the actor asks: "Is that the gym?" Before quipping: "yeah, this needs a bit of work." Now, it seems McElhenney's demands have been answered, with the club confirming on Wednesday that a new gym has been opened at the training ground. In a statement, Robinson implied the decision was made in part due to the joke in the docu-series. She said: "We are delighted to have been able to complete the building of the new gym at the Racecourse Ground. “As was picked up by the Welcome to Wrexham cameras, the existing gym facility was ripe for a big upgrade and this is another strong statement of our intention to build the Club up both on the pitch and off it, in line with the co-chairmen’s Mission Statement. Wrexham are currently top of the National League and aiming for a return to the Football League, having missed out on promotion last year in heartbreaking fashion. A run in the FA Cup is also on the cards after a dramatic 3-3 draw with Championship high-flyers Sheffield United at the Racecourse Ground earned them a replay in the Steel City.
