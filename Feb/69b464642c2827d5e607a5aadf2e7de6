Tommy Fury and Jake Paul’s Saudi showdown wasn’t well received by fans with many complaining about the lack of action. The Brit picked up the win via a split decision with scorecards of 75-74 Paul, 76-73 Fury and 76-73 Fury and is now expected to rematch Paul later this year. But few will be clambering for a second fight after a largely uneventful eight-rounder that failed to spark into life until the last round when Fury briefly touched down. "It was a terrible fight. Jake Paul was in over his head. Hopefully there's no rematch," wrote @CCFCxCR47. "Low quality fight, both boxers were ordinary. Commentators were hyping it up way too much and riding Jake Paul hard. Too much clinching, bad refereeing, but Fury controlled it for longer; had him up 5-3 at worst. #PaulFury," tweeted @JordanKounelis. "After all the hugging it was a split decision this was probably the worst fight I’ve ever seen @jakepaul barely did any fighting and @TommyFury1 should have taken that W in the first round," added @Sean42631377.
