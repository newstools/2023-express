Refugee charities operating in Calais are “fuelling” Channel crossings, the deputy chairman of the Tory Party said. Lee Anderson warned of what he called a “multi-million-pound industry” operating around illegal crossings, consisting of “hotels” and “lefty lawyers”. He accused the charities of being “just as bad as people smugglers”. A record 45,756 migrants crossed the Channel to the UK in 2022, despite repeated efforts by the Government to clamp down on the crisis. Mr Anderson, who is on the Home Affairs Select Committee, said groups such as Care4Calais were teaching migrants English. He claimed that refugee charities in Calais are “part of the trade” in illegal immigration. Mr Anderson said: “You’ve got the people smugglers, you’ve got the camps, the charities at the camps. “You’ve then got, when you get to England, the hotels, the lefty lawyers – it is one big multi-million pound industry.” Mr Anderson claimed that, on a recent trip to Calais with the committee, he saw “hundreds of young men” being helped by workers at the British Care4Calais charity. He claimed migrants were “encouraged” to make the dangerous crossing by being taught English by the volunteers. He added: “They weren’t fleeing any war, or persecution. They told us that they wanted to come for a better life in the UK.” A Care4Calais spokesman said: “Our operations in northern France focus on the provision of humanitarian aid and we seek to provide some friendship and dignity through activities like English lessons, football matches, simple teas and coffees. “We provide no assistance or encouragement to refugees in Calais and northern France with journeys to the UK. We do not want any individual to cross in a small boat, or attempt dangerous journeys by other means.” The Government has spent nearly £25million deploying the Royal Navy to stop migrants from crossing the Channel illegally, it has emerged.
