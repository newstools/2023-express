Aries A changeable mood makes it difficult for you to know exactly what you want or what you intend to do. A burning desire to get on with one thing could fade as quickly as it occurs, leaving you uncertain about how you want to occupy your time. The easiest approach will be: to go with the mood of the moment. Taurus Trying something completely new to you will be an exciting experience. Your aim will be to make the most of whatever stimulating pleasures are happening around you. If there is a lack of exciting events in your neck of the woods, you will take yourself off to more promising pastures. Gemini You’re keen to get out and about rather than remaining in the same place with the same people. Rather than staying in, you will have organised your day to allow yourself some free time and a trip out will be just how you want to spend it.                         Cancer It will come as some surprise to find you actually enjoy the company of someone you have not seen in some time. You felt you had nothing left in common but this won’t be true at all and with this in mind you will be doing your best to nurture this relationship in a way that prevents it from dragging on as it has done in the recent past. Leo A friend or relative will approach you to discuss an issue you have been deliberately avoiding. You feel resentful that they are pushing you to face this but if you can try to put these feelings aside, hear them out. Whatever views they may have had in the past, you could be surprised to find they see things quite differently now. Virgo Your heart is ruling your head making you more emotionally inclined than usual. If agreements made will affect your financial position or family routines, it might be wise to wait until a later date to make them. In fact, your handling of any and all things connected to money might seem a little unreliable at this time.   Libra A request from a close friend who is starting to expect a lot from you will seem casual at first. A favour they ask of you will not be a one you will want to perform. In addition to this you won’t be in the mood for their company when you have other things on your mind. Scorpio Financially, things are looking better than they have done for a while. Pooling resources with housemates will allow you to afford a household item you feel will benefit you all. Welcoming someone new to the family will add sparkle to your lifestyle. Sagittarius You are rarely down-in-the-mouth for long. Although there’s a dullness to some activities, this will soon pass and there will be one or two events later that will give you something to smile about. Be sure to show plenty of affection towards someone special this evening.   Capricorn A long-running dispute isn’t likely to be resolved anytime soon. Contingency measures will be put in place. Still, the situation is far from ideal. Anything connected with business will be a trifle dull but you should resist the temptation to let flights of fancy steer you away from tried and trusted methods. Aquarius Senior officials will decide to impose changes that will mean moving a proposal to the next level. A miniscule group with no significance will put forward objections but these aren’t likely to have any impact. Support for the recent dispute is beginning to subside. Pisces You have a lot of thinking to do before making important decisions. Someone will try to push you into giving an instant response. Get things straight in your mind before making any binding promises to others, especially to those who are known to get irritable with people who keep changing their minds.
