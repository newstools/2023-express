Tommy Fury was given a heroes welcome when he touched down in England late last night. Proudly displaying his belt with a wide smile on his face, TNT was swarmed by fans at Heathrow Airport. But the biggest welcome was waiting for him at home as girlfriend Molly-Mae Hague shared the touching moment Fury first arrived at their £3.5million Cheshire mansion. And there will be plenty of room for renovation on the luxury property with Fury pocketing a cool £3.7million for his Saudi showdown with Jake Paul. But despite getting the win, The Problem Child cashed in nearly double the money with £7.1million thanks in part to his 65% PPV bonus - a discrepency that would have been significantly reduced if TNT had accepted Paul's pre-fight double or nothing bet. If the Brit had signed the contract he would be looking at a total estimated purse of £10,976,621 or to put it in perspective £124,734 per punch landed.
