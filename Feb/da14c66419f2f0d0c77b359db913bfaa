The Lord’s Prayer may have to be rewritten as Church of England bishops consider radical calls to drop male references to God. In a move that would be resisted fiercely by traditionalists, a spring “gendered language” project could opt to ditch “He” and “Him” pronouns in prayers.  One “non-gendered” option is to axe “Our Father” from the Lord’s Prayer. It would have to be agreed by all members of the Church’s governing body, the General Synod. Surrey vicar, the Rev Joanna Stobart on Tuesday urged the Liturgical Commission, which develops service wording, to devise “more inclusive” language.  In 2018, Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said: “God is not a father in exactly the same way as a human being is a father. God is not male or female. God is not definable.” A CofE spokesman said: “Christians have recognised since ancient times that God is neither male nor female.”
