Princess Margaret's lady-in-waiting has recalled her 34-year affair after becoming aware of ex-husband Colin Glenconner's many mistresses. Lady Anne Glenconner, 90, never revealed the identity of her lover but claimed she turned to a close married friend.  She told Fox News: "I lost my trust in men. "We saw each other once a week. We had lunch and the occasional weekend. "But he gave me back [my trust]. And I realised that men can be wonderful, that men could be kind, and all that. "He made so much difference in my life."

His wife even invited the nonagenarian to say goodbye to her husband while he was on his deathbed. Glenconner recalled: "I didn’t know she was going to ask me, but I [was] so pleased when she did. "She sent me a memento after he died… I think she probably had some of her own.

"People had affairs. And yet, we carried on. It was an alternative to divorce." She also argued affairs among the upper-classes were very common at the time. Lady Glenconner worked as a close aide to Princess Margaret from 1971 until 2002. Glenconner introduced Sir Roddy Llewellyn, aged just 25 at the time, to the late Queen's then-married sister, who was 43, in 1973. She previously claimed the Queen Mother, who died just months after Margaret in 2002, thanked her as Sir Roddy made her younger daughter "really happy".
