A 50-year-old who had previously been deemed "fit and healthy" has died from meningitis. Days before being rushed to the hospital in a life-threatening situation, painter and decorator Gareth Rowlands started complaining of ear pain. The middle-aged man from Rhiwlas, Gwynedd, Wales, went to the hospital and was diagnosed by doctors as having brain damage as a result of an infection that "wasn't compatible with life", his stepdaughter said. He died on Saturday, February 4, in Ysbyty Gwynedd after being pulled out of the coma, according to Linzi Whitmore. He turned 50 on January 19, just three days after falling ill and while still in a coma in the hospital. Nobody could have predicted the magnitude of what was about to happen, said Ms Whitmore. She told Wales Online her stepfather was "fit" and a "healthy young man" until meningitis caught up with him and damaged his brain. She said: "Gareth complained of an earache on the Saturday, (January 16) headache on the Sunday and very early on the Monday morning, my mum found him literally fighting for his life, his brain being starved of oxygen." She continued: "Gareth was put in an induced coma and kept sedated, he was cared for brilliantly by the staff at the intensive care, Cybi ward. Unfortunately, an MRI scan confirmed that the majority of Gareth's brain had been tragically damaged with very little chance of survival. "Gareth was brought out of the coma, taken off the sedation and ventilation and tragically passed away at Ysbyty Gwynedd on February 4 2023. "I am kindly asking if people would like to donate towards Gareth's funeral so we can give him the best send-off possible. Diolch o galon, Linzi." Gareth leaves behind his three stepchildren, Linzi, Jamie, and Sam, as well as Angie, his spouse of 29 years. You can donate to the fundraiser here.
