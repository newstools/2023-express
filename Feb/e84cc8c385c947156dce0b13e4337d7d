John Torode, an Australian-British chef who first moved to the UK back in the 1990s, has been a regular fixture on TV ever since. His glittering portfolio includes stints on This Morning and a presenting slot on Masterchef. When the celebrity chef returned home to his native Australia, inviting the nation along with him in footage screened on BBC Good Food, his show received the highest viewing figures of any programme on the channel in 2014. Today, John looked overwhelmed with pleasure as he received his MBE from Prince William, who awarded him personally at Buckingham Palace. He looked dapper in a black suit as his contributions to British food culture were acknowledged.
