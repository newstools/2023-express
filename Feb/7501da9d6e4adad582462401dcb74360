The upcoming episode of Law and Order SVU has been hotly anticipated after it was revealed Fin Tutuola (played by Ice-T) could find himself in some trouble. However, fans took to Twitter with anger when they realised the long-running NBC drama was on hiatus.   Emotions recently ran high after fans were disappointed to learn Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Elliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni) didn’t have their long-awaited kiss. However, tensions soon eased when Benson was back in the precinct and tackling crime with Fin. As Benson and Stabler’s close call wasn’t addressed in episode 13, fans were hoping the upcoming instalment would shed light on the heart-stopping scene. Due to the 12th Annual NFL Honors awards ceremony, Law and Order SVU didn’t hit the screens.

Thankfully for fans, the network released an official synopsis for the upcoming episode, Dutch Tears. It reads: “A recently released convict goes looking for his arresting officer, Fin Tutuola. “Dominick Carisi (Peter Scanavino) tries to get an arrest warrant without a positive suspect.”  The log line promises a personal and thrilling case for fan-favourite Tutuola, who’ll have to watch his back when the series returns. While Carisi could find himself in deep trouble as he will try to break the rules to ensure an arrest. This comes just shortly after his marriage to the recently departed detective Amanda Rollins (Kelli Giddish). Despite the disappointment, fans can be rest assured Law and Order SVU will return to screens next Thursday. Law and Order: Special Victims Unit season 24 continues Thursday, February 16 on NBC in the USA. A UK release date is yet to be announced.
