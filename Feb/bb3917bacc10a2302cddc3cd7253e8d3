A British man has been found dead on the side of the road with a head injury in Chile. The 67-year-old was found on the side of the T-354 road in the coastal town of Niebla near Valdivia. The victim had a Chilean ID card and was a regular in the country, police said. Police confirmed he was a widower of English nationality, according to the local outlet Diario de Valdivia. A 74-year-old woman who lives in the area went to the local police station on Sunday and told authorities the man had gone out for a walk at around 12pm. The cause of the man's death remains unknown.  An investigation is underway following his death. In 2022, a British astronomer vanished on a research trip in Chile's Atacama desert. Professor Tom Marsh, 60, from Rugby, was found about three miles from the La Silla astronomical observatory, where he disappeared on September 16. Local police said at the time his body had been found "in the face of an intense search" by the team.
