On 8 February 2023, we published an article under the headline “Erling Haaland ‘makes request to lawyers’ with Man City star planning to jump ship” which reported claims in the Spanish media that Erling Haaland had asked lawyers to bring forward the release clause in his Manchester City contract ahead of a potential summer transfer to Real Madrid. We further reported claims that Haaland had not ‘tuned in’ to Pep Guardiola’s methods and that the possibility of sanctions being imposed on Manchester City for financial irregularities were playing on his mind. We have since been informed by representatives of Mr Haaland that these claims are untrue. We have withdrawn the article and are happy to correct the record.
