Pluto changes signs this month, and this only happens roughly once a generation, according to astrologers. Collectively speaking, as Pluto moves into Aquarius, astrology experts suggest the world moves towards a more humanitarian society. But the transit means something different for each star sign. Express.co.uk spoke exclusively to Inbaal Honigman, Celebrity Psychic and Astrologer who delivered a horoscope summary for each star sign this March. Inbaal said: “March 2023 calls on us to look into our attitudes towards equality and charity. Two significant planetary shifts occur this month, both around Aquarius, interestingly enough. “First, the planet Saturn, the planet of Karma, moves from Aquarius to Pisces on the 7th. Saturn has been in Aquarius for over two years, so the change means that some global attitudes may shift around environmental issues, and will tug at the heartstrings - perhaps an ecological incident. “Then, the planet Pluto, the planet of endings and beginnings, moves into Aquarius on the 23rd, for the first time in over 200 years, so there will be a more powerful enforcement of legislation around equality.” Inbaal explained: “Good news on the romance front, Aries! Venus, the planet of love and the home is in your sign until the 16th, and this means that, whether you're trying to meet someone new or entice someone old, it is working. “The blessings of Venus make you attractive to all - and to top it off, generous planet Jupiter is in your sign all month long, bringing good luck with money, so you could go on dates to fancy places.” READ MORE: King Charles's reign 'won't be long' - psychic claims “You're a lucky sign envied by many because your ruling planet is Venus, named after the Goddess of love and beauty, so your effortless style and wry humour are no accident,” she added. “This month, Venus planet of love is in your sign from the 16th onwards, so brace yourself for starry eyes and love letters, as you're about to be living your best romantic life. Since your ruling planet is in your personal sign, it feels 'at home' so the effects on your love life can be extreme.” “Everything is dual for you anyway, Gemini,” the astrologer continued. “You see both sides of any story, and you feel two opposite emotions around any situation. You see the good and the bad in life, both at the same time. “This month, a sort-of dual planet is in your sign - Mars, the planet of passion and war. So until the 24th, while Mars is in Gemini, you fancy everyone, but also want to fight them. In both cases, make sure you take a deep breath and ask yourself how far you want to go.” “The shifting waters of your moods are nothing new - you can switch from melancholy to party mode within the space of an hour,” Inbaal said. “Your ruler is the dreamy moon, and it transits into a new sign every two and a half days, which is why you can appear moody. Then, on the 12th of March 2023, three whole planets form a favourable angle with the moon. “The Sun itself, as well as Mercury, the planet of communication and also Neptune, the planet of fantasy all band together in a positive way. This is a day to make a bold move and follow your dreams - so they stop being dreams and become your reality.” DON'T MISS...Makeup technique that distracts attention from forehead wrinkles [EXPERT]Kate's style mistake proves she’s ‘mastered the art of fashion' [COMMENT]Cook a whole Sunday roast without using an oven - three methods [CHEF TIPS] “The end of the month feels like a breath of fresh air for you!” She remarked. “Since you are ruled by the Sun, your days and months will shift and change as the sun transits through the signs. “Until the 20th, it is still Pisces season, and the sun is in dreamy and intuitive Pisces, so you feel more romantic and in harmony with those around you. When the sun goes into fiery Aries, you feel like your old self again, active, vibrant and sociable. You'll feel like you can gamble and never lose because Pisces lends its intuition to you, and Aries, its courage.” “The full moon in Virgo on the 7th of the Month only ever happens during Pisces season, once a year,” the expert noted. “This is a time of manifesting for you - look at what you want from life, write down some goals and then set a plan to achieve them. Your full moon will cause circumstances to sway in your favour. “Throughout March, your ruling planet, chatty Mercury goes through three signs, Aquarius, Pisces and Aries, meaning your communication style will change after the 3rd and again after the 19th.” “Harmony and balance are a big part of your identity, and you absolutely avoid confrontations as much as you can,” Inbaal mentioned. “Your ruling planet Venus is as elegant as can be, and this month it moves between two of your biggest allies, which is good news. “Until the 16th, Venus is in Aries, your perfect opposite sign. It gives a spring to your step and you feel invincible. From the 17th onwards it is in Taurus, which is also ruled by Venus, so you feel aligned with, and understood by those around you.” READ MORE: Princess Kate’s ‘hair rule she swears by’ according to beauty expert “There's quite an enormous change coming up for you, Scorpio,” she said. “Pluto, the planet of endings and beginnings, which is your ruling planet, is moving to a new sign for the first time in 15 years. “The move is into Aquarius, which will influence you with its humanitarian nature and will push you to take an active part in furthering environmental causes. Pluto hasn't been in Aquarius since 1798, so you'll observe some big changes around you.” “You're a party animal by nature - this is influenced by your ruling planet, Jupiter, the planet of expansion, which is a generous and fun-loving planet,” the astrologer noted. “You're a free spirit, and this month, even more so. Jupiter is in fiery Aries for the entire month! Which means you are even more enthusiastic, even more independent, even more, excitable than usual, and that's a lot!” “It's a time of endings for you, as Pluto's long stay in your sign comes to its conclusion,” she continued. “The 23rd of March 2023 is a long-awaited moment, when Pluto, the planet of endings and beginnings, leaves your sign. The last time Pluto exited Capricorn was 1778, a time of great global changes, successful revolutions and the establishment of new empires. It's fascinating to try and guess what lies ahead.” “Big change in your sign this month, as the planet Saturn, the planet of karma and your own personal ruler, is leaving your sign,” Inbaal said. “Saturn has been in Aquarius for two years, and you've been feeling as if the rest of the world was aligned with your charitable, humanitarian nature. “Now it is leaving you, and you feel as if the wind is out of your sails from the 7th. In an interesting coincidence, the planet Pluto, which rules endings and new beginnings, goes into your sign on the 23rd, for the first time in over 200 years, so the wind is at your back again!” “Between the 3rd and the 18th, the planet Mercury which rules communication, writing and emails, is in Pisces,” the expert concluded. “The presence of this planet in your sign means that messages you've been waiting on, emails that need to arrive, and payments that you're expecting, will come to you without delay. It also means that your words will be taken seriously, so any interviews and conversations would go in your favour."
