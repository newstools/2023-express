The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) warns its 48-hour strike from March 1 will have a “significant impact” on the service. Emergency department, intensive care unit and cancer ward staff will be striking for the first time. Matthew Taylor said: “The difficult challenge of reducing waiting lists becomes almost impossible if this industrial actions spreads, particularly if junior doctors join. “So, the Government’s aspiration and public commitment to lower waiting lists is being jeopardised.” At least 7.2 million people were waiting to begin routine treatments by the end of October, NHS England data shows. RCN general secretary Pat Cullen said: “We are urging the Prime Minister to step in within 12 days.” Tory former health minister Lord Bethell said NHS pay disputes needed to be sorted “quickly”. Asked if he was calling for the Government to engage in talks, he said: “Yes, I am really worried the Government hasn’t got a positive attitude on this.” The warnings come as 1,500 paramedics prepare to strike on Monday in Wales with the GMB union, while 10,000 others do so in England – where 12,000 paramedics have justvoted to join industrial action again.
