Police have launched an investigation after a man approached a five-year-old girl and tried to pick her up at a park. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said a child was playing in Nuttal park in Ramsbottom when an unknown man approached her. The man then ran away into a nearby woodland area when the child's parents came over and she was unharmed. In a statement, police said a man seen in the area was wearing black gloves, a red bobble hat, a black jacket and had a backpack on. Chief Inspector Ian Partington of GMP's Bury District said the incident "caused some concern in the community" and urged anyone who has seen the man to come forward. Inspector Partington added: "We thank the public for their patience and assistance so far, and ask that anyone with information should contact us first to aid our investigation. “If you see the man described, call us on 101 quoting incident 1965 of the 12/2/2023.” You can also submit information anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
