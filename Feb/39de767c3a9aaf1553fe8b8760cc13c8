One Stop’s stores are located in the heart of neighbourhoods across the UK. Their community orientated approach has enabled them to raise and donate a total of £10 million for charity over the last ten years. This event will be a double celebration for One Stop after recently being awarded “Convenience Retailer of the Year” at the Retail Industry Awards 2022. To mark the celebrations, One Stop is donating £1,000 to up to ten local community groups and has partnered with the leading British baker, Warburtons to offer a free loaf for readers. Pick up your Express newspaper on Saturday 18 February, 2023 to get your hands on this great offer.
