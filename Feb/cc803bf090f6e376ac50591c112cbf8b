The ex-stable girl who unmasked ­herself as the woman who took Prince Harry’s virginity near a pub has urged him to make up with William. Sasha Walpole said she had a “sparky” encounter with him in 2001 at a boozy birthday bash. Ms Walpole, now 40, claimed they had 10 tequila shots then went to a meadow behind the Vine Tree in Norton, Wilts.  The mother of two and digger driver was asked on Thursday night what she would now say to the squabbling siblings. She told Piers Morgan’s Talk TV show: “Life’s too short…just sort out your differences and just chat. But I will probably never be in the pub with the two of them again.” Piers said the least Harry owed her was a drink and she replied: “Yes…just not a tray of shots.” Sasha was a hand at Highgrove, country seat of King Charles when she and Harry got together. After he referred to it in his memoir Spare, she spoke about their moment behind the pub where she was celebrating her 19th birthday. Harry was 16. She said: “The sex was passionate and sparky because we shouldn’t have been doing it.  “We went outside. We were quite drunk. I gave Harry a ­cigarette. He started to kiss me. There was no ­chatting, no words. It was exciting. We were away for 15 minutes, but the sex was about five minutes.” Sasha added on Thursday that Harry is “not the boy she remembers” and joked that he had “traded down” by ­marrying Meghan. She told Piers Morgan that both she and Meghan referred to the prince as “H.” Harry is tipped to make a 48-hour visit for his father’s May 6 Coronation at Westminster Abbey, but without his wife Meghan. She is set to remain in their California home where son Archie will turn four that day.
