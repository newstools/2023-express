Many older people will be left waiting years longer to receive their benefit. How much state pension one will receive depends on the number of years they have on their National Insurance record. The state pension may seem like a given, but not everyone is entitled to the full amount or even any at all. Britons usually need at least 10 years of National Insurance contributions to receive anything. People can check how many years they have on the Government website. To get the maximum amount of pension available, Britons need 35 years of contributions on their National Insurance record - although some may get a different amount if they were contracted out.

MoneyHelper explains a simple way to work out how much a person will get for their state pension depending on how many years of National Insurance contributions they have. Each year gives 1/35th of the full amount, for example: 35 years’ gives 35/35 x £185.15 = £185.15 a week30 years’ gives 30/35 x £185.15 = £158.70 a week10 years’ gives 10/35 x £185.15 = £52.90 a week. Britons can check their record to find out if they have any gaps, if they’re eligible to pay contributions voluntarily, and how much this will cost. The full new state pension is for those reaching state pension age on or after April 6, 2016.

The single-tier full state pension is £185.15 a week for 2022/23. People would need 35 years of National Insurance contributions to get this full amount. The old basic state pension applies to those people who reached state pension age before April 6, 2016. The full basic pension is £141.85 a week. People need 30 years of National Insurance contributions to get this amount. For less than 30 years, they will get 1/30 of the full amount for each year of contributions made. Despite the rise, many people may not be able to live comfortably on this amount. It may be worth considering any contributions from workplace and personal pensions too. Personal pensions can be accessed from 55 (rising to 57 in 2028). However, the age at which someone can claim the state pension depends on when they were born. The official state pension age is currently 66 for both men and women. However, the age is gradually rising to reflect the fact that people are living for longer. This means future generations will likely have to wait longer to access their state pension. The age at which individuals can draw the state pension will rise to 67 between 2026 and 2028. Between 2037 and 2039 the state pension age will increase further to 68. This comes after a Government review in 2017 brought these dates forward by seven years. However, there is speculation that the Government could raise the state pension age to 68 as early as 2033 in order to help balance the public finances.
