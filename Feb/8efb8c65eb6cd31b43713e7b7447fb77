Amanda Holden, 52, has been sending her fans wild the last few weeks as she showed off her various ensembles for Britain's Got Talent auditions. She took to Instagram today to show off her birthday outfit, from Beach Cafe to her 1.9 million followers, as she posed at a beautiful undisclosed location. Amanda posed in a tiny purple two-piece bikini, exposing her taut abs and gym-honed figure. She paired this with a similar purple kaftan, with a birthday badge placed on it. Amanda captioned the post: "52 today - grateful to be alive and happy with people I love."
