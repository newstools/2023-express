Twitter users appear to have limited access to the social media platform after a number reported issues on the app. Some accounts have been logged out of Tweetdeck, with others unable to access direct messages and unable to post after supposedly exceeding the daily tweet limit.  Many users were unable to post on the site for about 90 minutes Wednesday evening and reportedly received a message that read: “You are over the daily limit for sending Tweets.” Users also reported not being able to post from mobile phones. They were met with an error message that read: “Tweet not sent.” This was followed by: “We’re sorry we weren’t able to send your tweet. Would you like to retry or save this tweet in drafts?” READ MORE: China has sent spy balloons around the globe  Twitter users also claimed they weren’t able to send or load direct messages. However, Twitter was back up and running as usual roughly 90 minutes after users first started reporting issues. The social media was mostly back up around 11pm GMT. The internet-tracking service Downdetector showed that the number of users submitting Twitter problem reports skyrocketed starting around 9:30pm.

Twitter hasn’t announced any update to its daily limits. It’s not clear if the change on Wednesday was intentional or if it’s a temporary glitch. The company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. According to Twitter’s website, the company limits the number of tweets that people can send to 2,400 per day and the daily limit for direct messages is 500.
