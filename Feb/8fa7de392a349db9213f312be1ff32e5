Former Top Gear host Richard Hammond fears a 319mph crash while filming the BBC show has caused early onset dementia. The Grand Tour presenter, 53, almost died in 2006 when the Vampire jet car’s front-right tyre blew, causing it to spin out of ­control and flip upside down.  He revealed he was in a medically induced coma for two weeks and afterwards suffered from post-traumatic amnesia. He later said he had barely any memory of the 12 months after the crash. Speaking on the Diary of a CEO podcast, he said: “I worry about my memory because it’s not brilliant. I can still read a script and deliver it but my long-term memory is ­not brilliant. “I have to write things down and work hard to remember them sometimes. It might be the age, it might be the onset of something else. I worry about that. I do.” After the crash, Richard admitted suffering from depression which his wife Mindy, 57, was warned could be an after-effect of the brain injury.  The father-of-two explained: “Mindy was told by the doctors that a frontal brain lobe injury would possibly lead to me having a greater propensity for obsessive compulsion and depression and paranoia. “She was like, ‘You didn’t meet him before the crash, did you?’ which is quite funny.” In 2017, Richard was involved in another crash, this time in a Rimac supercar. He was airlifted to hospital in Switzerland while filming Amazon’s The Grand Tour. Speaking about the aftermath of the crash, he said: “I had very bad post-traumatic amnesia for weeks. Like a one-minute memory.” He added: “I was perfectly happy reading the same newspaper every single day ­several times a day.” Freddie Flintoff was also involved in a car accident filming Top Gear. The former England cricket ace, 45, was airlifted to hospital with facial injuries and broken ribs after a collision at Dunsfold Aerodrome, in Surrey, on December 13.
