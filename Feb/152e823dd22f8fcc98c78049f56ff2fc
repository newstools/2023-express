Jake Paul will be hoping to seal the biggest win of his fledgling career by defeating Tommy Fury in tonight's hotly-anticipated grudge fight at the Diriyah Arena in Saudi Arabia. The Youtube star has carved out a name for himself in the professional ranks in recent yeats but will be coming up against a true boxer for the very first time in Fury, who is desperate to protect his family name by doing a job on his American opponent this evening. The weigh-in on Saturday got physical as the two fighters shoved each other in their final meeting before the first bell rings, with Paul supremely confident that he will be able to pull off a convincing win in order to prove his boxing credentials to the world. "He's acting on stage, getting all hyped up, trying to act like his brother [Tyson Fury]," said Paul. "This professional boxer is going down; it's easy, it's simple.Â I'm ready, calm, cool, collected. This is what I do. He's shaking up on stage, you can see the nerves running through his system. I'm chill." Fury was joined at the weigh-in by half-brother Tyson and predicted an early finish to tonight's bout by insisting: "Tomorrow night, his time is up. Jake Paul will no longer be boxing. I'm gonna put this guy away in four rounds." Follow Express Sport's live updates below.
