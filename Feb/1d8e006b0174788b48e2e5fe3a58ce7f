Four teenage boys have been arrested after a 15-year-old girl was allegedly raped at a school in Dover. The boys, aged between 13 and 16 are thought to have arrived unaccompanied in the UK from Afghanistan last year. The Times reports that one of the boys, aged 15 was arrested on suspicion of rape while the three others were arrested on suspicion of facilitating the attack after allegedly pinning the girl down and acting as "lookouts". All four boys are believed to have been pupils at the same school as the victim. A spokesman for Kent police confirmed their investigation into the alleged incident continues while the boys have been released on bail. A Kent Police spokesperson said: “Four boys were arrested as part of the investigation and have since been released on bail while enquiries ­continue.” The teens are reportedly in the care of Kent county council's social services after they arrived in the UK. The total number of migrants who have crossed the English Channel this year has already exceeded 2,000, Home Office figures suggest after a further 52 people arrived in one boat on Saturday. Analysis of Home Office and Ministry of Defence (MoD) provisional figures show 1,180 people were brought to the UK in January 2023, compared to 1,339 in January 2022. So far, 890 people have been brought to shore in 20 boats in February 2023. The busiest day of 2023 was January 25 when 321 people were brought to the UK in eight boats, while the busiest day on record was August 22 2022, when 1,295 people were rescued. On Sunday Foreign Officer minister Andrew Mitchell said the Governments plan to send migrants to Rwanda would only have a "marginal" benefit. So far no flights have departed the UK carrying migrants to the African nation. Mr Mitchell said the plan was not the "whole answer" to the problem. He said: “It will be a marginal benefit. What we have to do is to stop these boats and there are a series of other mechanisms which we could use to do that,” he said.
