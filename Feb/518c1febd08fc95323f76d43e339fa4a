Meghan Markle and Prince Harry attending the coronation would turn the event into a "ridiculous affair", according to a broadcaster. The comments come amid reports that the King is negotiating with Meghan and Harry over their attendance to the event. Writer and broadcaster Esther Krakue claimed the invite from King Charles was "a bit of a gamble". "[The Palace] feels like if they invite the Sussexes they can get ahead of the story because, one way or another, they will still feature in the coronation whether they are there or not," claimed Ms Krakue. She added: "They have made sure that whatever happens with the royals, the spotlight is on them as well." Ms Krakue said she "understood" why King Charles would want to invite the Sussexes but warned that Briton's were "sick" of the Sussex saga.  She told Sky News Australia: "So, I kind of understand the stance the King is taking, but the reality is: The coronation is still a public affair, it's still a public event. I think many Britons are getting quite sick of this saga. "It's a tradition that we love and we would just like to perpetuate it and have it relevant to modern times. I don't think we want to carry on this Kardashian-style ridiculous affair to the coronation, which is exactly what would happen if the Sussexes do attend." She also claimed someone close to the King who might suffer if Prince Harry was invited: Camilla, Queen Consort. In his book, Spare, Prince Harry made a series of allegations against Camilla and said he once thought she had "sacrificed [him] on her personal PR alter".

Nevertheless, King Charles is said to believe having the Sussexes attend the coronation would be less of a distraction than if they weren't there. King Charles III's coronation will take place later this year on May 6.
