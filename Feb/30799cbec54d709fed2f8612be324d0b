As predicted, Sky is following its rivals by hiking prices for millions of customers across the UK. The popular TV and telecoms giant has just confirmed that things will increase from April with both television and broadband users thought to be affected. This update couldn't have come at a worse time for consumers already battling record food, mortgage and energy prices. Although it's clearly bad news for those about to be hit by the higher costs, Sky's changes are not as big as those coming from other firms such as BT and Virgin. Sky says that, on average, bills are going up by 8.1 percent - around £60 per year or £5.60 per month. That's compared to a whopping 14.4 percent hike from BT and an average of 13.8 percent from Virgin Media. Other Intenet Service Providers (ISPs) including TalkTalk and Vodafone are also ramping things up by over 14 percent. Each Sky customer will be affected differently depending on their current deal and what services they subscribe to but those using the firm's TV and broadband will be informed soon about the exact amount that will be added to their monthly outgoings. In fact, it's been confirmed that Sky will be writing to all those affected later next week. Some customers who aren't happy about the changes might find they can leave without paying the usual penalties and it's worth giving the company a call if you get your new bill and feel things are unfair. Switching to a new provider could save some money but there are also other things Sky users can do to slash their monthly outgoings. Removing certain bundles such as Sky Sports, BT Sport or Sky Cinema will cut costs along with dropping add-ons such as multiroom (£15 extra per month), turning on HD (£8 per month) or viewing in pin-sharp 4K (£10 per month). As we mentioned earlier, all of the major providers are putting up prices in the spring and we've got full details below.
