Meghan and Harry have to "scrounge" around for money to afford the luxury lifestyle they want, a royal biographer has claimed. Tom Bower, author of "Revenge: Meghan, Harry and the War Between the Windsors", claimed that Meghan is “money-obsessed” and wants a lavish lifestyle involving rides in luxury cars and “private jets on command”. Talking to GB News’s Dan Wootton, he claimed Meghan even married Prince Harry for that reason. He said: "Her great surprise and disappointment was that Prince Harry had very little money. "She had imagined he would be worth hundreds of millions if not billions and she is having to make up for it now. "She wants to ride in the big Cadillacs, the private jets on command. At the moment she needs to scrounge for those sorts of things." FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES…
