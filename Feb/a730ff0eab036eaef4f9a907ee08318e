Nadiya Bychkova, 33, stunned fans as she slipped into a sultry gold silk dress to attend the European Premiere of Creed III. The Strictly Come Dancing professional dancer was joined by her boyfriend, Kai Widdrington, as she made a dazzling appearance earlier tonight at Cineworld Leicester Square. The couple beamed while posing together for the cameras, with Nadiyaâ€™s beau, who wore an elegant three-piece suit, wrapping an arm around her waist. Nadiya commanded attention as she went braless under the fabulous floor-length dress, which featured a thigh-high slit that put her incredibly toned legs on display. The mum-of-one paired the glamorous look with a gold clutch and strappy heels, while wearing her hair in a sleek low-ponytail.
