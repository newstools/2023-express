Five people have died in a plane crash in the US. The pilot and passengers onboard the light twin-engine aircraft crashed shortly after taking off from Bill and Hillary Clinton National Airport in Arkansas this afternoon.  A statement from the Federal Aviation Authority confirmed the Beech BE20 was heading to Columbus, Ohio. It crashed around noon after one mile from the runway. There is currently no information on what caused the crash near Little Rock. The Little Rock Fire Department has put out spot fires caused by the crash, and police were reported to be at the scene working to get more information. Dennis Gordon told the Arkansas Democrat Gazette he was standing on 39th Street when he heard the wind pick up and then an explosion. Several smaller explosions followed, and then a huge fire, he said. “It was just red, then it starts turning black, and there’s this burnt smell,” an eyewitness said. He said he’d watched a plume of black smoke rise over the trees before fire crews arrived and extinguished it. The plane crashed in a wooded, rocky area on 3M Road, near the 3M plant at 3110 Walters Road and about one mile from the airport, authorities said. Lt. Cody Burk, a spokesman for the Pulaski County sheriff’s office, said the weather was bad at the time of the crash, but stressed this was not the final cause.
