A man heroically pinned down a drunk driver following a crash that left an off-duty police officer dead, footage from the scene has revealed. Dylan Molina, then 26-years-old, crashed his rental Jeep into a sedan while driving at high-speeds through an intersection in November 2021. Detective Alex Cervantes died at the scene but his wife and two sons survived after sustaining injuries. A video from the crash, which took place in Lake Worth in Texas, showed Molina attempting to flee the scene. The drunk driver then took a tumble while a neighbour, identified by WFAA as Justin Gonzalez, pinned him down before authorities arrived. Mr Gonzalez can be heard yelling: "Stay right f*****g there. "You f*****g killed somebody, m**********r. Get your a** over here."

While pinning the drunk driver to the ground, he shouted: "You f*****g killed somebody you m**********r. You killed somebody! Stay right there!" The footage also showed other neighbours attempting to help Cervantes and his family. Gonzalez, who was returning home for a Thanksgiving gathering at the time of the crash, told WFAA: "I don’t know why it had to happen that it did. "But I knew he wasn’t going anywhere. I couldn’t let him go." Molina pleaded guilty to intoxication manslaughter following a plea deal. He was later sentenced to 15 years in prison. Speaking last month, Cervantes' widow Priscilla told Fox 4: "It’s not gonna bring Alex back, but at least he’s locked behind bars and not able to hurt another family like he did ours." Molina was involved in a minor crash before killing Cervantes and was arrested for a previous drink driving incident. Police also released surveillance footage from a Fuzzy's Taco Shop in which bartender Cala Richardson can allegedly be seen over-serving Molina.

Police chief JT Manoushagian said: "Eight doubles, 16 single shots, is more than anybody should have in a three-hour period. Maybe even at all. "Clearly, not in a good place to be operating a vehicle. Clearly intoxicated. "He’s holding another one of those double vodka and Red Bull drinks there, and then he simply walks away." He added: "The offence of driving while intoxicated is something that we’re not going to tolerate."
