Tributes have poured in from all across the football world to mourn the loss of the beloved John Motson after he passed away on Thursday. The man behind the microphone of BBC's football coverage for the best part of 50 years died at the age of 77, the broadcaster confirmed, with dozens of famous sporting figures paying their respects to the iconic commentator. Figures such as Gary Lineker, the former England international striker and Motson's colleague at BBC Match of the Day, said they were left "deeply saddened" by his passing as memories of Motson's distinguished career were revisited to celebrate his life. Premier League clubs have also paid tribute to the long-serving commentator, who led BBC's coverage for Champions League and World Cup finals. Elsewhere, Manchester United are in action on Thursday to face Barcelona and the Red Devils could mark Motson's passing at Old Trafford tonight. It may be their best chance yet to challenge for silverware since their last trophy triumph in 2017 and managerial legend Sir Alex Ferguson is thought to be keen on playing some part in helping Erik ten Hag keep things on track. The pair met for dinner to discuss the Red Devils ahead of their clash with Barcelona, and it is understood the Scot wants to help Ten Hag in the club's affairs this season after a positive meeting with the Dutchman.
