A British skiing tourist has died after an off-piste accident in the French Alps, emergency services confirmed on Sunday. The skier, who was 50 years old, suffered a cardiac arrest as well as multiple fractures, after “taking off” at “very high speed” and landing on a slope covered with rocks, according to The Times.  The incident took place in the Saulire sector of the popular Meribel resort, where the world skiing championships are ongoing. French media reported that the Brit was pronounced dead at the scene. In less than fifteen minutes after being notified of the crash, mountain rescue staff from Courchevel were on-site, according to local reports. Those that witness the accident are said to be “in shock” and are currently receiving professional psychological help. An investigation by French police is underway, with the high speed at which the skier was travelling thought to be the cause of the fatality.
