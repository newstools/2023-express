Lady Amelia and Eliza Spencer wowed in black see-through outfits as the pair attended Milan Fashion Week on Wednesday. Amelia, 30, the niece of Princess Diana and daughter of Earl Spencer, and her twin sister, looked chic as they arrived at the Del Core fashion show. Eliza donned a see-through lace top that she teamed with a mid-length skirt with a thigh-high split. She teamed her look with a pair of open-toe heels that elongated her long legs. Amelia opted for a tight bodycon dress which she accompanied with sheer leggings as she flashed the flesh, adding a pair of towering heels.
