The Russian military has suffered its highest casualty rate since invading Ukraine last February, representing another blow to Vladimir Putin's war ambitions. On Sunday, the Ministry of Defence released information on how Russian deaths are rising in Ukraine. In a statement on Twitter, the MoD said: "Over the past two weeks, Russia has likely suffered its highest rate of casualties since the first week of the invasion of Ukraine. "The Ukrainian General Staff release daily statistics on Russian casualties. Although Defence Intelligence cannot verify Ukraine’s methodology, the trends the data illustrate are likely accurate. "The mean average for the last seven days was 824 casualties per day, over four times the rate reported over June-July 2022. Ukraine also continues to suffer a high attrition rate. "The uptick in Russian casualties is likely due to a range of factors including lack of trained personnel, coordination, and resources across the front – this is exemplified in Vuhledar and Bakhmut."
