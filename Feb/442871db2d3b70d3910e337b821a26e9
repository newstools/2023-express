It's been hijacked by people who are now behaving like fascists.”As Bonnie tried to argue her point, she told the presenter as he was aware of the history of the word, he should use it correctly.She slammed: “Because you know that, you shouldn’t use it the way you use it, because you know that.“You shouldn't do it, you know better.” Elsewhere in the interview, Piers commented people who use the term are wearing it as a badge of honour.He continued: “I think it’s become a band of the new fascism, it’s basically people now embrace the word woke themselves and say, ‘I’m so woke that if you say anything I don't like, I’m going to ruin, shame vilify and cancel you.’”Bonnie told Piers he has the power to inform people about where the word came from as he told his guest he’s written a whole book about it.She added: “Then you shouldn’t use it! You shouldn’t use it that way.”Piers Morgan Uncensored continues weekdays on TalkTV from 8pm
