A shopper was terrified when she was chased by a badger around a petrol station shop. Molly Padget, who is originally from Hawarden, North Wales, was on her way back from work when she stopped in at a Shell garage and soon found herself being pursued by the silver-haired menace, reports North Wales Live. Badgers are usually wary of humans so to see one in the flesh is quite rare. To see one in a service station is even rarer.  In most cases, a badger's first reaction to danger is to escape into the nearest den. However, Molly encountered a creature who proved to be rather bolder. "It happened on Monday as I was on my way back from work at around 8pm," she explained. "I stopped in at the Shell garage in Stafford and there it was. "A police officer walked in and saw it, but then just turned around and walked back out," she added. Despite appearances, the badger wasn't actually shopping. It was a case of nature quite literally calling. "He didn't take anything, he just ran into the loos," Molly said."I was scared though when he chased after me, I dropped my curry trying to get away by going down two different aisles, he was always close behind until he went into the bathroom. It's the first badger I've ever seen alive. "None of the other staff members saw the badger come in, but when they did they all screamed. Then a random man asked for a brush and said he hadn't had his TB jab, but would have a good crack at ushering the badger out, which he did." Badgers and badger setts (burrows) are protected under the Protection of Badgers Act 1992, in England and Wales. This means you could be sent to prison for up to six months and get an unlimited fine if you’re found guilty of a number of offences.
