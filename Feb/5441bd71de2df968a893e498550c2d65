Max Verstappen will need to pay the FIA more than any other driver for his Formula One Super Licence in 2023. F1 stars must pay a base fee for the mandatory permit. However, there are performance-linked extras attached, meaning those with the most championship points pay more. Lewis Hamilton will pay just the sixth highest with others like Oscar Piastri and Nico Hulkenberg only paying the base amount. Verstappen enjoyed one of the most dominant seasons in Formula One history in 2022 as he set the record for most races won in a single year. He accumulated 454 points, also a new record, as he coasted to sealing the title with four races left to go. However, his success comes at a cost in 2023 as Verstappen will be charged a record £855,585 for his Super Licence. The base cost for the permit is £9,232, but each point won in the season costs an additional £1,864, bringing the Dutchman’s fee up to its dizzying amount. Charles Leclerc is second with a fee of £583,409 for the 308 points he gained last year while Sergio Perez is close behind with a sum of £577,817. Hamilton will pay £456,643 after finishing sixth with 240 points while Hulkenburg, Piastri and Williams newcomer Logan Sargeant will all pay the base fee after being largely uninvolved in Formula One last year.

Each manufacturer must pay a base figure of £511,531 before additional points charges are applied. Constructors champions Red Bull pay a higher premium of £6,137 per point while other outfits face a £5113 payout. The rules mean Red Bull will fork out £5.17m for the 759 points they gained last season while backmarkers Williams will have the comparatively low fee of £552,435 after winning just eight. All totals are exempt from Formula One cost cap rules. The FIA is set to be the biggest benefactor taking a cool £22.11m from the 10 teams.  Verstappen has been a prominent critic of the regulations, suggesting it costs too much to enter Formula One. "I think the sum is absurd," he told Austrian broadcaster Servus TV. "I don’t think it’s right that we have to pay so much. That’s not the case in other sports either. And there are more and more races." Fortunately for Verstappen he will not be out of pocket personally, with Helmut Marko confirming Red Bull foot the bill as part of his contract.
