This is the first time the Marburg virus has been seen in Equatorial Guinea. Hundreds of citizens in the country suspected to be infected have been quarantined, and neighbouring countries Cameroon and Gabon have restricted movement across their borders to contain the spread. Meanwhile, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has all sent teams to Kie Ntem, where all the cases have been reported so far. The WHO said 16 people had tested positive for the virus.

They are also providing medical care to those suffering symptoms of Marburg. The CDC (Centre for Disease Control and Prevention) said: “Supportive hospital therapy should be utilised, which includes balancing the patient’s fluids and electrolytes, maintaining oxygen status and blood pressure, replacing lost blood and clotting factors, and treatment for any complicating infections.” Symptoms of the virus include severe headaches, fever, diarrhoea, stomach pain, and vomiting. One of the reasons the Marburg virus is difficult to treat only on is because it shares many of its symptoms with other tropical diseases such as Ebola or malaria. There is currently no cure or treatment for the Marburg virus. The first outbreak of Marburg was seen in Germany and Serbia in 1967; the virus is named after the location of the first outbreak, the town of Marburg in central Germany.
