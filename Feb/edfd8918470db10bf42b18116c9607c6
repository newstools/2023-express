Recently released data from the Department for Transport found that between October 1, 2022, and January 1, 2023, just 26 public electric car charging points were installed on average each day. However, in order for the 300,000 figure to be met, this number needs to quadruple to 100. The data, which was provided by EV charging platform Zap-Map, revealed that there are now 30 EVs for every charge point, compared with 16 at the start of 2020. In order to meet the 300,000 target, monthly installations for new EV charging devices will need to increase from 806 to 3,130 – a 288 percent improvement. Thom Groot, co-founder and CEO of The Electric Car Scheme, said this underlined why more investment in charging infrastructure was urgently needed. He added: “We started The Electric Car Scheme to make the switch to electric more affordable, and great progress is being made.

"But for the electric revolution to really take off we need electric drivers to have the confidence that there are enough public charge points for them to use. “Transport is the UK's number one source of emissions, and if we are going to reach our Net Zero goals we will need to move rapidly here. “Scotland's decision to require that car parks with over 10 bays include electric charging could be a great start.” DON'T MISSTraffic chaos expected as train strikes bring country to a standstill [WARNING]Petrol and diesel prices begin to spike and could continue to rise [SHOCKING]Switching from diesel to EVs could save drivers almost £10k a year [INSIGHT] At the end of January 2023, there were 37,851 electric vehicle charging points across the UK, across 22,355 charging locations. This represents a 31 percent increase in the total number of charging devices since January 2022, according to Zap-Map data. Between the end of 2016 and 2021, the charge point network grew four-fold from 6,500 to more than 28,000 devices. Significant growth was also seen between 2020 and the end of 2021, as close to 7,500 charge points were added to the UK network, a growth of 36 percent.

Many experts have also called on the Government to set appoint a “charging lead” to be appointed to oversee the rollout of charging infrastructure. The person in this role would work closely with the industry to ensure that charge points are installed in places people need them the most, for example on motorways when drivers are making long journeys. The charging lead would also help the country to overcome barriers to installation. Despite many private charge point operators leading the charge with installations, many are urging the Government to support the rollout. In March 2022, the Government announced a tenfold expansion in chargepoints by 2030 to drive the EV revolution. This is being backed by £1.6billion in funding through the Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Strategy to reach the 300,000 target. BP Pulse is also supporting the rollout with £1billion in funding for ultra-fast chargers to create a “world-class network”.
