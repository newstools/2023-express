Pauline Quirke, 63, has been awarded with an MBE at Windsor Castle today. The actress, who starred in hit comedy Birds Of A Feather alongside Loose Women panellist Linda Robson, 64, and Lesley Joseph, 77, is the first cast member from the series to be honoured by the Royal Family. Pauline recently took a step back from acting to focus on The Pauline Quirke Academy, of which she is the Founder and Head Principal. The star shared a sweet, smiley exchange with Prince William, as he gave her the MBE for her services to young people, to the entertainment industry and to charity. Pauline is beloved by fans for her role as Sharon Theodopolopodous in Birds Of A Feather. She went on to star in Emmerdale from 2010 to 2012, and appeared in ITV crime drama Broadchurch.
