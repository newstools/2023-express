During the latest episode of Death in Paradise, Commissioner Selwyn Patterson (played by Don Warrington) arrested Neville Parker (Ralf Little) on suspicion of murder. The BBC drama began with the detective receiving a mysterious letter which read: "A murder will be committed today". Shortly after, water taxi driver Jake Dalton's (Ben Tavassoli) body was found. Neville and the team instantly got to work, and it didn't take him long to pinpoint the culprit - however, he couldn't prove it. The DI worked out that author David Cartwright (Patrick Kennedy) had committed the crime for no reason. Neville had clearly met his match and quickly became frustrated by his suspect, and after receiving a signed book from David, he went back to his hotel room to confront him. Although, moments later, David's body was discovered and Neville was the last person to see him alive.
