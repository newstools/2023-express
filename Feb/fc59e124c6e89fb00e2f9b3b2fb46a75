  The now-iconic heart rate challenge was first introduced in season 4, becoming an instant fan favourite. Last night, the girls were particularly blown away by Macclesfield F.C. footballer Tom Clare, who gave a performance rivalling Magic Mike’s. ITV fans will also be excited for the introduction of new islander Claudia Fogarty, who stunned the boys with her jaw-dropping entrance, as she appeared looking like a red Victoria’s Secret angel. Claudia, who is the daughter of 2014 I'm A Celebrity winner Carl Fogarty, will be introduced to the villa tonight.
