Jennifer Lopez, 53, was sure to turn heads as she took to the stage to present the first award at the 65th Grammy Awards ceremony. The hitmaker stunned in a star-studded silver midnight blue gown, featuring a large chiffon train. The dress was covered in silver rhinestones while the bottom of the gown featured a thigh-high slit, exposing her toned pins. Jennifer presented the award for Best Pop Vocal Album, with Harry Styles taking the award for his album Harry's House. Harry beat Adele who has not lost any nomination since 2010. Jennifer's husband Ben Affleck joined her at the star-studded event as they sat on a table beside Dwayne Johnson and his partner.
