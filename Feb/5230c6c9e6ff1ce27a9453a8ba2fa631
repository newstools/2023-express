Walking briskly for just 11 minutes a day slashes the risk of early death by almost a quarter, researchers claim. Around 1,100 steps at a good clip protect against cardiovascular disease and some cancers says the biggest global study, of 30 million people. Just 75 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise lowered mortality rates by 23 percent. Dr Soren Brage, study author, said: “Doing some physical activity is better than doing none. If you find that 75 minutes a week is manageable, then you could try stepping it up gradually to the full recommended amount.” One in five middle-aged Britons are physically inactive, blaming a lack of time and being too tired. The Cambridge University team used data from 196 papers and found doing more than the recommended 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity activity brought only marginal additional benefits. But even half this amount cut the risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer by 17 and seven percent respectively. Rates of some cancers fell by 14 to 26 percent – including those of the head, neck, blood, bone marrow, and digestive system. Prof James Woodcock, the study co-author, said: “There are substantial benefits to heart health and reducing your risk of cancer.” Researchers calculated if everyone who was studied did at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity activity, around one in six early deaths would be prevented. If they managed at least 75 minutes, around one in ten would be. Dr Leandro Garcia, of Queen’s University Belfast, said: “Replacing some habits is all that is needed. Try to walk or cycle to your work...instead of using a car.” The study is in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.
