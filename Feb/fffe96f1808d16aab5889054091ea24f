Tonight the Super Bowl kicks off and as usual, there’s a plethora of movie trailers and advert starring celebrities. Joining them is Workday’s Big Game Spot Rock Star, which has recruited some rock and roll legends. In the minute long clip Ozzy Osbourne, KISS’ Paul Stanley, Gary Clark Jr, Joan Jett and Billy Idol challenge corporate types on calling each other rock stars when they don’t really know what it takes to be one. At one point Ozzy, who recently cancelled his upcoming tour due to on-going health issues, admits: “I’ve done my share of bad things.” The 74-year-old later shows up in the footage ready for a desk job and asking his colleagues to call him “Ozwald”. Posting a link to the advert on his social media page, the Black Sabbath legend captioned it: “You know, I never thought I would look this good in a tie... Anyway, see you in the office on Monday. Donut order is under “Ozwald.”
