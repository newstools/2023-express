Britain’s Got Talent judge Amanda Holden, 51, amped up her sexy side as she showed off her sensational figure in a silky red Boux Avenue negligée. Embracing the romance of Valentine’s Day, which is fast approaching, the Heart FM presenter grinned in the sultry nightwear while carrying a tray of cocktails. She captioned the snaps: “Happy Friday! Slipping into something a little more comfortable for the weekend @JDWFashion “No matter if you’re all loved up or a singleton, try and pop something new into the top drawer this #valentinesday to make you feel your confident best.” Amanda went on to prove that office-wear can still be stylish, as she flaunted her endless legs in a fitted LBD with a cheeky cut-out midriff section. The blonde beauty went braless in the “sassy black number”, for an office to date night vibe before meeting her husband Chris Hughes for lunch.
