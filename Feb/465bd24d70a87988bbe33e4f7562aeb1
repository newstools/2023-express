Princess Eugenie was spotted at an art show in LA, looking every bit the Hollywood native with a pair of sunglasses balanced on her head. The royal gazed at her smartphone during the visit to the Frieze LA VIP preview held at Santa Monica Airport. Pregnant Eugenie, mum-of-one to August, wore a black polo neck jumper over her baby bump. Covered up with a jacket, the belted beige "Carla" coat by French Connection. She also wore Louis Vuitton's 'Capucines' handbag in black slung over her shoulder. The bag, from the luxury French brand, costs Â£5,300. Eugenie is an art fan and worked for two years for a New York auction house between 2013 and 2015. Eugenie was employed by Paddle8, an online auction firm.  The Frieze takes place yearly and showcases the best in modern art from around the world. Eugenie attended the event along with the likes of actors Owen Wilson and Margot Robbie. Eugenie and her husband Jack Brooksbank are currently on holiday in the US. It is thought they are visiting Eugenie's cousin Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle in Montecito. The holiday comes amid rumours the pair are looking to relocate permanently to the US, reportedly eyeing up apartments in West Hollywood. Currently, the couple split time between England and Portugal, where Jack Brooksbank travels for his work with the Discovery Land Company. When the pair are in the UK they stay in Frogmore Cottage, which was initially renovated for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle to live in after their wedding. The home is reported to have a large copper bath and a yoga studio.
