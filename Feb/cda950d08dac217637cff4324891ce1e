 The crash occurred at around 8.30am local time (1pm GMT) in Laval, a city with a population of 437,000 in Quebec.  Eyewitness Hamdi Ben Chaabane told news outlet CBC the driver exited the bus and "took all of his clothes off", describing the situation as a "nightmare".  He said: "He was totally naked. We don't know why he did that. We dove on him. We tried to subdue him."  Mr Chaabane said children were trapped under the wheels of the bus.
