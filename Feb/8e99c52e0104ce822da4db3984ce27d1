A woman was knocked out in a mass brawl which involved around 20 people in a town centre. The victim is understood to have had her wedding ring stolen in the fracas in Merthyr Tydfil, south Wales, caught on camera in the early hours of Saturday morning. An 18-year-old man is in hospital with facial injuries suffered in the scrap. The husband of the injured woman told reports WalesOnline the violence broke out near a bar in the town. He said: "It was a random attack. There was no incident previous to it. Everyone was outside the bar waiting to go home when about 12 to 20 young men started beating people up. Punches were flying everywhere. "They even hit my wife in the face, knocked her to the floor and stole her wedding ring. My missus was knocked out for 10 minutes. She's got bruising all over her face, two teeth have gone through the inside of her lip and she's waiting for a follow-up hospital appointment to see if her nose is broken because they can't tell at the moment."  He said his 31-year-old wife already struggled for confidence and the attack has "knocked her for six". The missing nine-carat Celtic-design gold wedding band is worth around £150. He claimed that around five men were also attacked and hurt in the clash. South Wales Police Inspector Jon Duckham said: “An 18-year-old man suffered facial injuries and remains in hospital.
