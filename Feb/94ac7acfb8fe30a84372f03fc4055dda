The Queen legend has collaborated with the We Will Rock You original cast member on albums and live performances over the years and now they’re teaming up once again. On this occasion, Sir Brian May heard the track Battlefield on Kerry Ellis’ upcoming album Kings and Queens and asked if he could play on it. The track written by Charlie Turner is “a heart-rending ballad, evoking a poignant message about the world we live in today.” The album and its title track are a tribute to both King Charles III’s upcoming coronation and also her friendship with Sir Brian. The new record was recorded in Los Angeles and London and features both original songs and hand-picked covers. The latter includes Tina Turner’s Be Tender With Me Baby and Carrie Underwood’s Love Wins. Kerry said: "I have loved every second of creating this new album. Working with Mike Stevens was a dream, he edged me into a new direction which I’ve thoroughly enjoyed. Each song has its own special identity and quality. The Westway team have been brilliant and so supportive and I can’t wait to perform these songs live and for everyone to hear this album – I am incredibly proud of it!"
