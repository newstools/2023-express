Agatha Christie’s classic novel Murder Is Easy will be adapted into a two-part thriller for the BBC, the broadcaster announced on Tuesday. Known as one of the Queen of Crime’s most disconcerting novels, the eerie whodunnit was first published in the 1930s and has been a cult favourite with fans for decades.  Director Meenu Gaur said: “I am part of the worldwide club of Agatha Christie’s fans and followers and therefore thrilled to be shaping one of her works for the screen. “I was drawn to the sassy, cool, witty and not to be messed with women of Murder Is Easy and blown away again by how delightful her characters are.” Writer Sian Ejiwunmi-Le Berre is adapting the story for the BBC, and said: “I’ve watched every Agatha Christie ­adaptation because Christie wrote for the world and the whole world loves her back. “But somehow I’d never read one of her novels. When I first read Murder Is Easy, I couldn’t believe how daring, experimental and furious the book was. Nothing like I’d expected. From the first read, the book was shouting at me how to enter and adapt it.  “It’s like going on an extended train journey with a genius sat next to you, whispering the secrets of storytelling into your ear.” Dame Agatha’s great-grandson James Prichard said: “This is one of my great-grandmother’s best and most disconcerting titles. Of course, murder isn’t easy. Or is it if you live in a traditional, unsuspecting English village?” The story concerns the sleepy English village of Wychwood under Ashe, where a killer is said to be on the loose. Filming will take place later this year and casting will be announced in due course, the BBC said.
