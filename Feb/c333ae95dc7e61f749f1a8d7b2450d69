King Charles has been warned the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are "going nowhere". Commentator Daniela Elser argued Buckingham Palace should not lower its guard now that Prince Harry and Meghan appear to have stopped levelling criticism and claims at the Royal Family. Commenting on a fresh warning from veteran royal biographer Angela Levin to the King that things are getting “out of control”, an op-ed she penned for News.com.au read: "While the Palace might have somehow scraped through the TV series, interminable interviews and book’s release, with Charles, Camilla, William and Kate’s public approval only having suffered slightly according to polling, it would be naive to think this particular crisis is over. "His Majesty and his loyal troop of HRHs might be slowly emerging out the other side of Spare, but the Sussexes are going nowhere." Ms Elser added whether the Duke and Duchess of Sussex can be successful as non-working members of the Firm without "dishing royal dirt" is also a question for the Palace, as that could help predict whether Meghan and Harry will move on from speaking about their family across the Atlantic or not. She said: "The current respite the Palace might be enjoying from any sort of Sussex tempest may well only be temporary." FOLLOW THIS LIVEBLOG FOR UPDATES ON THE ROYAL FAMILY
