The Queen Consort expressed her “shock and dismay” over the changes made to the text of world-renowned children’s author Roald Dahl as she became the latest famous face to join the war on woke.  She joins the Prime Minister, author Sir Salman Rushdie and other leading publishers and literary agents who have criticised the changes. Though her intervention was subtle in nature, the meaning behind her comments - where she implored authors not to let anyone “curb the freedom of your expression or impose limits on your imagination - was clear, censorship has no place in literature. By putting freedom of speech above the age-old royal tradition of turning a blind eye to controversial topics, Camilla is proving her relevance in the modern age and is proudly showing she’s not afraid to stand up for what she believes in.  “Let there be no squeaking like mice but only roaring like a pride of lions,” she told her guests, words she herself appears to have taken inspiration from as she takes a firm stance on defending freedom of expression and protecting a fundamental caveat of our democracy. Camilla’s remarks are brave and admirable and show she’s not afraid to flirt with controversy, even if it opens her up to abuse. Many had questioned whether Charles and Camilla would be any good at steering the royal ship after the Queen’s 70 years at the helm. But yesterday the Queen Consort proved they have a purpose and younger royals can certainly learn from her fearlessness.
