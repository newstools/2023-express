Policing Just Stop Oil protests cost taxpayers £7.5million over nine weeks in London alone. Met Police data revealed the daily bill was as high as £630,000 last autumn. The force said money could have been better used tackling priority crime. Just Stop Oil supporters climbed motorway gantries on the M25 and the QEII Bridge in Dartford, Kent, and blocked main roads in London. They also sprayed orange paint over buildings in the capital and staged protests at tourist spots. Some activists held slow marches along main roads in London and other cities to avoid arrest for blocking highways. The £7.5million cost to the Met Police – divulged by a Freedom of Information request – covers the nine weeks when protests were held from October 1 to December 14. It includes the bill for staff – 13,600 police officer shifts – and keeping vehicles on the road. Some 755 arrests were made – with 184 leading to charges, to date. Home Secretary Suella Braverman said: “Enough is enough. "Blocking motorways and slow walking in roads delays emergency services, stops people getting to work and drains police resources.” Met Police Commander Karen Findlay said: “We are determined to work with the CPS to charge everyone who has brought misery to the public through unlawful actions.” Just Stop Oil wants an end to new licences to produce fossil fuels.
