Drivers are facing a 40-mile detour which will take them around 90 minutes to get around a 200-metre stretch of roadworks. The diversion put in place will lead commuters through 13 towns and villages. Local residents and businesses have slammed the proposed route with it costing drivers fuel and time. One local told The Sun: "There are much easier and shorter routes, so why are they making it so difficult for motorists? It makes no sense." The 195-metre stretch of road on the A371 at Rodney Stoke, between Wells in Somerset and Cheddar eight miles away, is shut for five days later this month. Traffic will be told to head 40 miles away via Wells, Glastonbury, Street, Ashcott, Knowle, Highbridge, and Axbridge. Drivers can opt for a shorter route by using B-roads and lanes. But official diversions put in place have to cater for each vehicle so A-road closures will use other A-roads. The works are to allow Gigaclear to upgrade internet cables in the area. It said: "We regret any inconvenience." In 2020, a similar detour was in place on the same road at Westbury-Sub-Mendip so Bristol Water could replace a tap.
