If your current Samsung telly is looking well past its sell-by date then now could be a good time to go online shopping. UK gadget store Currys is currently offering massive savings on these popular goggleboxes thanks to some hidden discount codes with some prices slashed by as much as £400. For example, pop Samsung's impressive QE85 in your shopping basket, then add the code VISION400OF at the checkout and you'll instantly receive £400 off the marked price. That means instead of paying £1,999, you'll only be charged £1,599 for this giant 85-inch QLED screen. That's not the only Samsung code that's available with Currys also offering other discounts including £50 off of the 43-inch QE43 (use the code VISION50OFF) and £200 off of the 55-inch QE55 (use the code VISION200OFF). Along with these discounts, there are a bunch of other savings to be made with Currys also offering cashback on some screens and the option to buy now and pay things back in six months' time. They are solid deals with many now making it cheaper than buying the televisions directly from Samsung. If any of these offers have got you thinking about upgrading your TV then here are some of the best deals from Currys and the code you'll need to get the discount.

Samsung has just announced its new range of tellies which will arrive in stores later this year and feature improved visuals, better smart home integration and clever AI that can adjust the picture scene by scene to make sure movie and boxset binges always look perfect. These upgraded goggleboxes will replace the current 2022 models which means what's on sale will soon look a little bit outdated. if that doesn't bother you then expect plenty more discounts in the coming weeks as stores try and get rid of older stock. Speaking about the new screens, Cheolgi Kim, EVP of Visual Display Business at Samsung Electronics, said: “In 2023, we are pushing boundaries of innovation to offer consumers more than just premium picture quality, but a holistic, premium device experience tailored to what they need and want out of their connected home." "With SmartThings, our advanced technology is seamless and intuitive, which can make life more accessible and enjoyable everyday."
