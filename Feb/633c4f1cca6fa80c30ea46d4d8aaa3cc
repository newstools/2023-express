A police investigator has testified that Alabama basketball star Brandon Miller gave a gun to ex-teammate Darius Miles, during Tuesday's hearing at Tuscaloosa County District Court. The gun was used in a fatal shooting on January 15 according to Det. Branden Culpeppe, although Miller has not been charged as there is no suggestion that he was involved in or knew of the intention to commit the crime. Jamea Harris was shot and killed back in January, and it's been claimed that Miller delivered the murder weapon.The 23-year-old was shot and killed on the Tuscaloosa strip in Alabama, and former Alabama player Darius Miles is facing murder charges for the shooting, with another man, Michael Davis, also involved. Miles was removed from the team after being arrested, while the other man, Davis, is thought to have pulled the trigger.However, Miller reportedly gave the murder weapon to Miles, as law enforcement stated that Miles texted Miller to bring Miles’ gun to the scene and it was exchanged in Miller’s car. Miller has not been charged as there's no suggestion he was involved in the crime, and Express Sport have reached out to The University of Alabama Police Department for comment. Alabama coach Nate Oats has said that his star player is "not in any trouble," and that he's been aware of the ongoing investigations. "We knew about that," Oats said recently."Can’t control everything anybody does outside of practice. Nobody knew that was going to happen. "College kids are out, Brandon hasn’t been in any type of trouble nor is he in any type of trouble in this case. Wrong spot at the wrong time."Miller has been Alabama's standout player this season, and is their leading points scorer. He's averaging almost 19 points per game, and has not missed any of their 27 matches so far this season.
