This week’s episode of Queen The Greatest Live continues a deep dive back into the band’s crucial rehearsals. And this time it’s a look at rare footage from their final tour with Freddie Mercury and John Deacon. The 1986 Magic tour was Queen’s biggest ever with the four performing in vast venues to audiences of tens of thousands. The set of shows would see the band play 26 concerts at 20 separate locations in the UK and in nine European countries over a period of just eight weeks, so the boys knew they had to be really well prepared. In the video below, classic footage from the Magic tour shows is cut with secretly taped film in the rehearsals; footage that was captured unbeknownst to the band and management. Freddie and Brian May are shot on a home movie camera performing Tear it Up and I Want To Break Free, as the singer swings his mic stick around and the guitarist plays an incredible riff. Queen’s long-standing multimedia collaborator Simon Lupton commented: “We don't know who shot it, but it was clearly someone with access to the rehearsals who took the initiative and shot it on their home movie camera. From the angles and quality, it certainly wasn't official and the band – and presumably management – were unaware!” READ MORE: Freddie Mercury soundcheck with new Brian May, Roger Taylor interviews Simon added: “Although it would have been very much frowned upon at the time, it now gives us a rare and fascinating insight into the rehearsal process. The tape came to light in about 2003, I think, when a collector unearthed it thinking it was a copy of the TV broadcast of Live at Wembley, only to discover this rare gem.” Next week’s Queen the Greatest live video will cover The Soundcheck.
