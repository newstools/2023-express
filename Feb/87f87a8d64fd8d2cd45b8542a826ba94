One false move and all Tiger's hard work could "go up in a puff of smoke", so it's best they rein it in and learn to proceed with caution. Rabbit (1951, 1963, 1975, 1987, 1999, 2011, 2023) Rabbit is a relatively passive sign and is "conflict-avoidant" whenever they can be. However, they run the risk of being walked all over. Conflict in some situations is totally healthy and even necessary for progress and growth. Dragon (1952, 1964, 1976, 1988, 2000, 2012, 2024) According to astrology, Dragon's biggest flaw is that they can have a huge ego. Indeed, this sign may sometimes think that if they are right, "everyone else is wrong". It's crucial that Dragon learns that other opinions are valuable too, and jumping down someone's throat is not the way to settle differences. Snake (1953, 1965, 1977, 1989, 2001, 2013, 2025) Other signs should avoid angering Snake, as this sign has a penchant for "vengeance".

Thinking about others does not come naturally - "if you want something, that’s all that matters, never mind who gets hurt along the way". In order to maintain solid friendships, it is important practise empathy, as the effects of hurting others can be "tragic". Goat (1955, 1967, 1979, 1991, 2003, 2015, 2027) According to astrology, Goat can be "co-dependent", much the opposite of Horse. This sign should work on doing things on their own in order to maintain their independence. Monkey (1956, 1968, 1980, 1992, 2004, 2016, 2028) Charming Monkey can verge on "arrogant" sometimes, so it's important they keep this in check or run the risk of annoying others. Admittedly, Monkey is very intelligent, but would do well to remember that everyone has their own strengths. Rooster (1957, 1969, 1981, 1993, 2005, 2017, 2029) Rooster's worst trait is usually that they are "egocentric", and run the risk of "wounding others deeply with their words" - some empathy would not go amiss. Dog (1958, 1970, 1982, 1994, 2006, 2018, 2030) Dog is a rather half glass empty sign, and their biggest flaw is certainly their "pessimistic" nature, according to astrology. "It can be easy for you to fall into negative thinking, resulting in further anxiety, paranoia, and suspicion." Dog would do well to remember that not everyone is out to get them all the time. Pig (1959, 1971, 1983, 1995, 2007, 2019, 2031) Finally, according to Astrology Answers, the sign of the Pig is "indecisive" and will often let themselves be led by others. Pig should realise the necessity of trusting their own judgements, making their own mistakes and learning their own lessons.
