These striking images show Canon Michael Gisbourne putting the finishing touches to a display of candles in the shape of King Charlesâ€™s monogram on the floor of Ripon Cathedral, in North Yorkshire. A team of staff and volunteers have spent the last week placing more than 7,000 candles in a series of intricate, flickering designs throughout the building. One of the oldest feast days in the Christian church, Candlemas marks the presentation of the baby Jesus at the Temple on February 2.
