As many as 60,000 Russian soldiers are "likely" to have been killed in Ukraine since the start of Vladimir Putin's war, the UK's Ministry of Defence has said in its latest bulletin. Meanwhile Vladimir Putin is ready to test a hypersonic missile he has previously declared to be “unstoppable” during the course of joint military drills with China and South Africa. The MoD tweeted: "Russian Ministry of Defence and private military contractor (PMC) forces have likely suffered 175-200,000 casualties since the start of the invasion of Ukraine. This likely includes approximately 40-60,000 killed. The Russian casualty rate has significantly increased since September 2022 when ‘partial mobilisation’ was imposed. "By modern standards, these figures represent a high ratio of personnel killed compared to those wounded. This is almost certainly due to extremely rudimentary medical provision across much of the force." The bulletin continued: "Artillery has almost certainly inflicted the majority of Russia’s casualties. "Wagner PMC forces have deployed large numbers of convict-recruits. These have probably experienced a casualty rate of up to 50%." A frigate carrying the Zircon weapon has been send to the 10-day exercise in the Indian Ocean, which will be ongoing during the first anniversary of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24. The confirmation of the drills sends a signal to Western leaders on the day they gather in Germany for the Munich Security Conference. THIS IS A LIVE BLOG - SCROLL DOWN FOR REGULAR UPDATES
