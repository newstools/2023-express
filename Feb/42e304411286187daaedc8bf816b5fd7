All eyes are turning to the return of Champions League football tonight after another rip-roaring weekend of Premier League action, with Liverpool set to face Real Madrid in a mouthwatering last-16 first-leg clash at Anfield later this evening. The Reds were beaten by their Spanish counterparts in last year's final and will be out for revenge in front of their own fans tonight as they look to secure an early advantage heading into next month's decisive second-leg meeting at the Bernabeu. The Merseyside giants could welcome Darwin Nunez back to their squad for the visit of Real Madrid after Jurgen Klopp hinted that the forward may be ready to feature in this evening's match following a knock against Newcastle United over the weekend. The Liverpool boss told reporters: "There's a chance. From all the possible scenarios, apart from being absolutely nothing, that's not the case. We have to see how he can deal with the pain [and] when we know that, we make a decision." Manchester United, meanwhile, are currently in the process of finding new owners after a number of formal bids were submitted on Friday and further discussions have reportedly been taking place over the last few days as the situation develops. There is also plenty going on at Stamford Bridge as Chelsea mull over what to do with Graham Potter, who has endured a turbulent time of things since taking over from Thomas Tuchel earlier this season and was booed by fans after Saturday's home defeat at the hands of Southampton.
