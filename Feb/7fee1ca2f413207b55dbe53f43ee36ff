Video footage shows the terrifying moment a huge fire erupted at a Birmingham restaurant. It is believed the flames may have been caused by a sparkler in a drink. The West Midlands Fire Service was called out to Caffe Di Milano in the city at 11pm on February 4. Staff managed to put the fire out and the restaurantâ€™s sprinklers activated just before emergency services arrived at the scene. No one has been reported injured. A 13-second video was shared on TikTok showing people dashing out of the restaurant while scrambling for their belongings. The clip also showed a member of staff at the restaurant throwing an ice bucket over the fire. A fire service spokeswoman said: "We were called at 11pm to Caffe Di Milano on Hurst Street. We sent two crews. The fire was out on arrival - the staff had managed to put the fire out before we got there. "We made sure it was safe and completed damping down and cutting away of anything that wasn't safe. The stop came at 11.27pm." A similar incident occurred at a busy restaurant in Mayfair just before Christmas. Popular bar MNKY HSE was set ablaze after a cocktail sparkler was caught on a Christmas tree. London Fire Brigade warned of the dangers of sparklers in drinks. One person who was there said that the fire went up "in seven seconds".
