Cornwall residents fume as popular bakery food chain Greggs opens up a branch in the “heart of the county.” The Newcastle-based bakery has struggled to establish itself in the home of the pasty as past attempts have been dismissed and abandoned due to local opposition.  However, the pie war continues as Greggs opened up a store in the county town Truro, in December. Planning consent is being sought for an Esso filling station on the A30 at Altarnun near Bodmin Moor whilst another store looks set to open at a new service station in Newquay after an advertising ­hoarding appeared there. Some residents fear the business feels emboldened to invade spread further into the region with one resident describing the company as the “devil’s spawn.” Once both sites are open it would bring the number in Cornwall to five. The bakery chain opened its first store in the county in 2019 in Saltash, close to the Devon border. But it closed after just nine months because it didn’t win enough customers.  Before the Truro outlet, it launched two shops in Cornwall but these are tucked away at Pennygillam Industrial Estate on the outskirts of Launceston and at Cornwall Services by the A30. Local residents go on to say that any new stores in Cornwall “won’t last”. Another added: “There is no way we would ever eat that rubbish when you have vast amounts of places selling the real thing, the iconic Cornish pasty.” The Cornish Pasty Association is sure it will win the ­battle. A spokesman said: “Greggs does not make their products in Cornwall and therefore do not sell the highly prized, genuine Cornish pasties that our members make. “We believe it’s important people have a range of products to choose from and are confident the Cornish pasty’s future will not be jeopardissed by Greggs.” Greggs has been ­contacted for comment.
