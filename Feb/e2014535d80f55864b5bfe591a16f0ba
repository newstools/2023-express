Drivers forked out over £1billion to fix damage to vehicles caused by potholes between April 2018 and June 2021, figures reveal. In total, 1½ million potholes on local roads were reported to 51 UK councils, the AA found.   And James Jackson, boss of car repairs payment website bumper.co.uk, said this number would “inevitably be much higher if potholes on major roads and motorways werealso included”. Three-quarters of councils now have a “risk-based approach” to fixing potholes, according to data from 190 of the 207 local highway authorities put together by the RAC. This means they consider the type of road, the volume of traffic it carries and the mix of vehicles using it in addition to the size, width and depth ofthe holes before deciding whether to mend them. However, there is no national statutory definition of what compromises a pothole. Mr Jackson said a “cynical individual” might suggest that a cash-strapped local authority could simply increase its classification of a pothole to avoid repairing the road. Two-thirds of local highway authorities only investigate when a pothole is 4cm deep or more, according to the RAC.   Mr Jackson said: “The lack of clarity on potholes has left roads in a degenerative state. “All too often, motorists are left to navigate craters in the road which can cause significant damage to the tyres. “Potholes cost motorists over £1billion a year in tyre replacements alone. Improved infrastructure is a must. “If you’re worried about the damage potholes might be causing to your tyres, check them regularly for damage or wear, especially before a long journey. “If you’re worried about the cost of repairs, your mechanic might be able to suggest alternative payment methods.” Bumper.co.uk found that if just one-quarter of the reported potholes on local roads were 3cm deep and piled on top of each other, the hypothetical tower would reach 11,250m. the equivalent to the cruising altitude of a civil aircraft.
