Prosecutors are now examining the case of a professional footballer arrested 18 months ago on suspicion of numerous child sex offences after it was referred to them by police. The player was detained in July 16, 2021 as part of an investigation launched by Greater Manchester Police. A Crown Prosecution Service spokesman said: “We received a file of evidence from Greater Manchester Police on 31 January 2023 following an investigation into allegations of multiple sexual offences. “We are considering this material in line with our legal test.” The CPS will now evaluate whether to bring a prosecution against the footballer, who cannot be named for legal reasons, and who has been on bail since his arrest. There is no timescale available in terms of when the process will be complete. When deciding whether to prosecute a criminal case, lawyers must follow the Code for Crown Prosecutors. In order to charge someone with a criminal offence, prosecutors need to be satisfied there is sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction, and also that prosecuting is in the public interest. The player was suspended by his club after his arrest, with the club releasing a statement at the time in which it said it “will continue to support the authorities with their inquiries”.
