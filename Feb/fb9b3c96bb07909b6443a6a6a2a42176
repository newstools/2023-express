The fund is supported by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and offers financial assistance to those struggling with the cost of living crisis.

Here is a full list of how much each council is being given through the Household Support Fund, broken up into each region in England: READ MORE: Inheritance tax expert says now is a good time to use up allowance READ MORE: Recession fears continue despite UK economy growing Mims Davies, the DWP Minister for Social Mobility, Youth and Progression, shared why this vital support is a lifeline for councils at this moment in time. She explained: “The Household Support Fund has already helped vulnerable families across England through these challenging times and I am pleased it will continue to do so for another full year. “This is just one part of our extensive and targeted £26billion support package, which includes payments worth £900 for millions of people on benefits and additional support for disabled people and pensioners, whilst every household will continue to save money thanks to our Energy Price Guarantee. “We also know that bearing down on inflation is one of the best ways to help families cope with rising bills, which is why the Prime Minister has made halving inflation this year one of his top priorities.” Households are currently dealing with the ongoing cost of living crisis which is partially caused by a soaring inflation rate and rising energy bills. Energy prices have increased by 27 percent for homes with average gas and electricity usage since October 2022. On top of this, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rate of inflation for January 2023 remains extremely high at 10.1 percent. Both inflation and energy bills are expected to continue to put pressure on working families throughout 2023 as the rise in the cost of living continues.
