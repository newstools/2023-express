There’s been plenty of demonic horror movies over the years, but the latest is based on real-life events as recorded in the books of Father Gabriele Amorth. The late Chief Exorcist to the Vatican wrote of his extensive demon hunting in titles like The Antics of Satan and His Army of Fallen Angels and The Devil is Afraid of Me. And now Russell Crowe is playing the Roman Catholic priest, who died at 91 in 2016, in new horror movie The Pope’s Exorcist. The synopsis for the terrifying new film reads: “Inspired by the actual files of Father Gabriele Amorth, Chief Exorcist of the Vatican (Academy Award winner Russell Crowe), The Pope’s Exorcist follows Amorth as he investigates a young boy’s terrifying possession and ends up uncovering a centuries-old conspiracy the Vatican has desperately tried to keep hidden. In real-life, Father Amorth claimed to have performed 160,000 exorcisms by May 2013, although not all were full-blown possessions. Nevertheless, he claimed that a person could be possessed by more than one demon at once, sometimes in their thousands – just like the group called Legion exorcised out of one man into a herd of pigs by Christ himself in Mark’s gospel.

He did it in 1981 by attacking John Paul II by working with those who armed Ali Ağca.” The Pope’s Exorcist is released in UK cinemas on April 7, 2023.
