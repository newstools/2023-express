Sony treated PS Plus subscribers to a nice surprise during the recent State of Play event, announcing the March 2023 PlayStation Plus Essential games ahead of schedule. During the PS Plus section of the State of Play conference, Sony confirmed that Battlefield 2042, Code Vein and Minecraft Dungeons would join the PlayStation Plus Essentials line-up in March. Unfortunately, however, fans face a slightly longer wait for the games to be released. Because of the way the dates fall, the March 2023 PS Plus games won't be available until next week. Instead of launching this week as some fans might expect, Battlefield, Minecraft Dungeons and Code Vein will join the line-up on the morning of March 7. On the plus side, it means that PS Plus subscribers have another week to download the February 2023 line-up, which includes The Evil Dead, OlliOlli World and Mafia Definitive Edition. The current line-up will be available until the morning of March 7, so you'd better add them to your library now. As for the March free games, Battlefield 2042 is undoubtedly the pick of the bunch. EA's shooter takes place in a near-future setting, and supports 128-person multiplayer over a selection of huge maps and epic game modes. Code Vein, on the other hand, has been described as the anime Dark Souls. "In the not too distant future, a mysterious disaster has brought collapse to the world as we know it," Sony explains. "Towering skyscrapers, once symbols of prosperity, are now lifeless graves of humanityâ€™s past pierced by the Thorns of Judgment. "At the center of the destruction lies a hidden society of Revenants called Vein. This final stronghold is where the remaining few fight to survive, blessed with Gifts of power in exchange for their memories and a thirst for blood."
