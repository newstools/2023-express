After launching in the US and Japan in 2022, Sega's bite-sized Astro Mini V finally gets an official release in Europe. Previously only available as an import, the SEGA Astro Mini V can now be purchased from Amazon for £229. A follow-up to the original Astro Mini, the new version features a grand total of 22 games, including a wealth of 2D shooters like Raiden, Samurai Aces and Gunbird. The Astro Mini V's headline feature is a 4.6-inch vertical LCD monitor, ball-top joystick and action buttons that replicate the original machine. Fans can also pick up a separate Astro City USB controller for some two-person multiplayer action.  Likewise, anybody hoping to play on the big screen can plug it into the TV using the bundled HDMI cable. In terms of games, the Astro Mini V comes with 22 built-in titles, primarily from the shoot-em-up genre. This includes legendary releases like Batsugun, Armed Police Batrider, and Kingdom Grand Prix, as well as Psikyo titles such as Gunbird, Strikers 1945 and Samurai Aces.
