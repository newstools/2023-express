Michael J Fox, 61, was pictured courtside at the New York Knicks Game with his wife Tracy Pollan, 62. The Back to the Future star looked very youthful in a New York Knicks bomber jacket with bright orange lettering and an orange striped collar. He sported a rugged look with his scruffy beard, teamed with black trousers for the basketball outing. His wife Tracy kept on the theme and went for an all-black ensemble, teamed with a gold necklace. They were spotted sitting next to another celebrity couple, actress Emma Stone and director Dave McCary. This comes after the Hollywood star recently revealed that his Parkinson's diagnosis, at the age of 29, led to him battling an addiction to alcohol and prescription drugs.
