Yesterday, in Shamima Begum’s citizenship deprivation case, the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) found the Government may have failed in that duty. The judges found that Begum was likely groomed in the UK and trafficked into Syria when only 15-years-old. Due to legal technicalities, the judges could not overturn the Home Secretary's decision to strip Begum’s citizenship. But in their ruling, they lambasted a series of Government errors. The judges found possible “state failures” in the UK’s response to the trafficking threat posed by Islamic State and said there are strong arguments to investigate these failures. And it said the Home Secretary’s decision to strip Ms Begum’s citizenship was based on “political rather than national security factors.”  This has long been clear. Our closest security allies have asked us repeatedly to repatriate our nationals from make-shift, unstable detention facilities in northeast Syria, highlighting that most detainees are children and it is dangerous to leave them there.  The US has brought back its nationals, and its diplomatic officials have become “extraordinarily frustrated with Britain’s failure” to do the same- because Britain’s do-nothing policy is bad for national and international security. Spain, France, Canada and Australia have all brought families home in recent months. Meanwhile, the UK is burying its head in the sand, hoping the problem will go away. The Government should act responsibly, bring back our citizens, put those who have committed offences behind bars and support those who were victims of ISIS traffickers. For the sake of their own political interests, Ministers are abandoning basic principles of British justice – and abandoning British children in the desert. They must think again and abandon this failed policy. Maya Foa is the Director of Reprieve.
