The Kansas City Chiefs will face the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LVII on Sunday night with the Vince Lombardi Trophy on the line, but some NFL fans are still unsure as to why the trophy has that name. The Chiefs are aiming to become the NFL's next great dynasty, following in the footsteps of the New England Patriots. Patrick Mahomes led the Chiefs to glory at Super Bowl LIV, and is hoping to repeat that feat agains the Eagles at State Farm Stadium on Sunday night. The Eagles, however, are looking to recapture the Vince Lombardi Trophy for the first time since 2018. Despite the game being watched by millions of NFL fans around the world, there are still some who are confused as to the name of the sport's championship trophy. Express Sport is on hand with the breakdown. The Super Bowl has been played annually since 1967, with the Green Bay Packers defeating the Chiefs in the first-ever championship game. The Packers, coached by Vince Lombardi, defeated the Chiefs 35-10. They then went on to win the second Super Bowl by defeating the Oakland Raiders 33-14. Lombardi retired as head coach of the Packers after the second Super Bowl, holding a 100% record in the NFL's championship game while boasting two Super Bowl rings. The Super Bowl trophy remained called the World Professional Football Championship trophy for another 12 years, until Lombardi passed away from cancer. After his tragic death, Lombardi was immortalised with the NFL naming the championship trophy after him. The first Vince Lombardi Trophy was awarded to the Baltimore Colts at Super Bowl V, when they defeated the Dallas Cowboys 16-13.
