The billion-dollar Fast and Furious franchise has a two-part finale, with the first getting a brand-new trailer today. Vin Diesel’s Dom Toretto has some serious choices to make as no doubt not every member of the family is going to make it out of these last two movies alive. Joining the all-star cast this time are Jason Momoa’s villain, Brie Larson and original West Side Story star Rita Moreno. Check out the trailer above and the official synopsis below.  "Over many missions and against impossible odds, Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his family have outsmarted, out-nerved and outdriven every foe in their path. Now, they confront the most lethal opponent they’ve ever faced: A terrifying threat emerging from the shadows of the past who’s fueled by blood revenge, and who is determined to shatter this family and destroy everything—and everyone—that Dom loves, forever."

What they didn’t know was that Reyes’ son, Dante (Aquaman’s Jason Momoa), witnessed it all and has spent the last 12 years masterminding a plan to make Dom pay the ultimate price. "Dante’s plot will scatter Dom’s family from Los Angeles to the catacombs of Rome, from Brazil to London and from Portugal to Antarctica. New allies will be forged and old enemies will resurface. But everything changes when Dom discovers that his own 8-year-old son (Leo Abelo Perry, Black-ish) is the ultimate target of Dante’s vengeance." Fast X hits cinemas on May 19, 2023.
