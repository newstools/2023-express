Brooklyn Nets megastar Kyrie Irving has rocked the NBA world by demanding a trade away from the franchise within the next six days. Irving has reportedly told the team that he will leave in free agency this summer if he doesn't get his trade. All-Star guard Irving demanded a trade last year, and was reportedly given permission by the team to seek a sign-and-trade. The superstar guard has been forced to carry the load for Brooklyn recently due to an injury suffered by Kevin Durant. Irving will be a free agent in the summer, having picked up his $36.1million player option on his contract for this season. He was expected to wait at Brooklyn until the summer before assessing his options for his next team, but it now seems he wants things done quickly. According to Shams Charania of The Athletic, Irving has told the Nets that he wants to be traded within the next six days - before the trade deadline on February 9 - or else he'll simply leave in free agency this summer. The Nets won't be short of options if they do decide to put him on the trade market, and could well make a deal with the Los Angeles Lakers to send him to the West coast. The Lakers were interested in him last year, and could be tempted to offer up Russell Westbrook in exchange. Westbrook is under contract until the end of the season on a massive $47m salary - but hasn't put up the numbers to hold up his end of the deal. As a result, the Lakers have been expected to trade him at some point in order to free up cap space and get some weapons around LeBron James in order to mount a challenge for the NBA Championship. If the Lakers were to trade for Irving, it would see a reunion between Irving and James - for the first time since they won the NBA Championship together with the Cleveland Cavaliers. Acquiring Westbrook's expiring contract would also give the Nets the chance to go again in free agency this summer with cap space to move for a new superstar to accompany - or, perhaps, replace - Kevin Durant.
