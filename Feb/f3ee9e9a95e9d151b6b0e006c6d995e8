McDonald's has been blasted for its "tasteless" advertisement opposite a crematorium. The sign promotes the fast food chain's chicken burger and reads "McCrispy" but it is right opposite Penmount Crematorium, a council-run facility in Cornwall. It has divided opinion somewhat but, after some criticism, McDonald's has said it will remove the advert. One woman, whose mother-in-law was cremated at the establishment last year, said: "Although I can see the funny side, it is tasteless and I'm sure some grieving family members won't like to see it when visiting Penmount for the funeral and cremation of a loved one." When a Cornwall Live reporter asked people what they thought of the sign, someone replied: "I think how funny it is will probably depend on how long ago you followed the crematorium sign wearing a black tie." Writing on Facebook, one man said: "It is very unfortunate placement." Another Facebook user posted: "It is bad taste and insensitive for mourners travelling to a funeral."  But some admitted to finding the image rather amusing. "Fell off the chair laughing," one Facebook user posted. And, of course: "I’m lovin’ it" - the chain's slogan - was repeated by many Facebook users too. Cornwall Council, which runs the crematorium and owns the bus shelter, said it was unable to comment on the matter. McDonald's is taking it seriously though. When shown a photograph of the sign, a spokesperson said: "We were unaware of the road sign in the vicinity of this bus stop. However, in light of the concerns raised by CornwallLive, we have asked for our advertisement to be removed."
