Lord John Randall of Uxbridge, Tory MPs and nature groups have called on the government to maintain vital environment safeguards threatened by the Retained EU Law (REUL) Bill. Lord Randall said: “As an EU member, the UK was a driving force behind much of the bloc’s ambitious nature legislation. “This bill, our own legislation, is now needlessly threatening the status and strength of these vital protections for rivers, wildlife and public health. “Setting arbitrary deadlines and bypassing our sovereign parliament are not signs of good independent law-making. This bill must be greatly improved if not completely rethought.” The REUL Bill would give ministers and the devolved governments wide-ranging powers to preserve, restate or replace EU-derived legislation. It returns to parliament for its Committee Stage on Thursday. Conservationists have concerns about the Bill's attempt to scrap or reform around 4,000 laws already on the UK statute book – of which 1,781 relate to the environment – by the end of the year. Ruth Chambers of Greener UK, a coalition representing 10 UK green groups, said: “The government could have sought to seize specific Brexit opportunities, but this undemocratic bill will see those opportunities squandered. “Taxpayers are set to fork out millions for a handful of ministers to decide the future of an unknown number of important laws, with parliament locked out of the process. Restricting scrutiny over what is changed or scrapped also puts vital public health and environmental protections at risk. “If the PM genuinely wants an accountable government, then he must rethink and reform this bill.” Wildlife groups fear vital rules that protect iconic wildlife or local rivers and streams, and which keep certain pesticides out of food and chemicals out of toys, could be removed or be lost.
