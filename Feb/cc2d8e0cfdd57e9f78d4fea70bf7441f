Cindy Crawford, 56, looked sensational in a new social media post showcasing her sultry Valentine’s Day transformation. The supermodel uploaded a clip of herself eating chocolate in her pyjamas before changing into a show-stopping red satin negligee. She also swapped her casual messy bun for a side-parted hairstyle that framed her stunning features. The intimate shots appeared to be taken in her room, with the model’s bed covered in red roses. She captioned the post: “Which one are you? (You can be both!)”
