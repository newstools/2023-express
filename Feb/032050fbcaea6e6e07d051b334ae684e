It looks like the cost of buying an Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S could be about to go up in the UK. At the time of writing, the Xbox Series X has a recommended retail price of £450, while the Series S costs around £250. Unfortunately, however, Microsoft has increased the price of its Xbox range of consoles in Sweden, as well as Japan. With prices going up in different parts of the world, all signs point to something similar happening in the UK. Over in Sweden, the price of the Xbox Series X has increased by around £40, while the Series S costs an additional £24. If similar price increases come to the UK, then fans could be looking at a £490 price tag for the Series X and a £275 price for the Series S. Of course, nothing is official until Microsoft makes an announcement, but if you're thinking of picking up an Xbox, you may be able to save a bit of cash by buying now instead of waiting. Sony was the first company to up the price of its current-gen console, adding £30 to the price of both the PS5 and PS5 Digital Edition. Nintendo has also failed to rule out a price increase for the Switch, instead saying that it will continue to evaluate the market. An Xbox price increase would make more sense, especially following Microsoft's purchase of Bethesda and somewhat controversial takeover of Activision Blizzard. Microsoft also has to offset the cost of bringing its first-party games to Xbox Games Pass at launch. Any new releases in the Forza, Halo and Gears of War series will be made available on day one for Game Pass customers. That's on top of new Bethesda games like Starfield, not to mention any future titles in the Elder Scrolls series. If Microsoft can force through its Activision Blizzard takeover, then don't be surprised to see new Call of Duty games come to the service.
