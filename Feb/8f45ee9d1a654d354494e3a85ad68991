Harry Styles is up for a whole host of awards this evening at the most celebrated ceremony of the year for British music. With nominations in the Best Song, Artist, Pop/R&B act and British Album categories, insiders have anticipated he'll dominate the competition, just as Beyonce did days earlier at the Grammys. Harry was also given a nod at the prestigious ceremony, winning Best Album for Harry's House - and he'll be looking to replicate his success this Saturday. The Gucci ambassador arrived in a characteristically cool outfit, consisting of an all-black trouser suit with peplum blazer, and a giant rose corsage around his neck. The Brit Awards will air tonight at 8:30pm on ITV, where fans can catch Harry and his rivals battling it out for the top spot. Captions to follow...
