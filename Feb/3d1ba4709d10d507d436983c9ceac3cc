But with such arrogant attitudes from the top leadership, it's hardly surprising the reputation of the BBC is at such a low ebb. The true colours of BBC executives were first shown with the scrapping of free licences for the over 75s in 2020, when Mr Davie, the director general, and his colleagues refused to countenance any compromise to ease the pain of stopping this benefit for millions of older people. In direct talks with Mr Davie, I suggested widening the exemptions for paying the fee, to include, for example, all those living with dementia and the over-80s, but he would not listen. TV Licensing has been unable to prosecute the hundreds of thousands of over 75s who have not paid the licence fee since 2020, because of the uproar this would cause. But multiple threatening and intimidating letters continue to be sent to these households. Mr Davie’s rash remarks to his staff do indicate that, like a naughty boy, he feels a bit guilty about what he is doing. And so, he should. The licence fee, at a flat rate of £159, is a classic regressive tax, payable equally by the poorest households as well as those on an annual income of £500,000 a year. The director general’s managerial skills would be better employed in developing a fairer alternative to the current TV licence system, rather than relishing his success in forcing those on the lowest incomes to cough up. We have met the same arrogant response from the BBC in our joint campaign with the legal charity APPEAL, to get the Beeb to suspend prosecutions for TV licence non-payment during the cost-of-living crisis. BBC Executives have so far refused to change their prosecutions and enforcement policies in any way to reflect the large increase in households on the edge of poverty. What is the point of fining people who genuinely can’t afford the £159 fee and won’t be able to afford the fine? It is these families who will be outraged the most by Mr. Davie’s crass comments.
