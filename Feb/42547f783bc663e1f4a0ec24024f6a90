With successive Bank of England Base Rate rises, savers have been benefiting from increasingly higher returns on their savings. New research from Moneyfacts shows interest rates have been rising “month on month” and providers have been becoming increasingly competitive, a finance expert has said, which is a good sign for savers. Commenting on data drawn from the last 12 months, Rachel Springall, finance expert at Moneyfacts, said: “The consecutive Bank of England Base Rate rises, coupled with competition among challenger banks, has led to both the average easy access and notice rates hitting their highest levels in more than 14 years.” Ms Springall noted that the number of accounts on offer for savers has also grown, seeing the biggest month-on-month rise since March 2022 with choice now resting at the “highest count” since November 2022. She added: “These are all encouraging signs for the months ahead, particularly as we edge closer to a new tax year.” According to Moneyfacts’ research, the average easy access savings account interest rate rose to 1.74 percent up from 0.17 percent in February 2021, which stands it at its highest point since December 2008 (2.58 percent).

Ms Springall said that Cash ISA season has also “sprung a growth” in product choice, which is edging closer to “record-breaking levels”. Ms Springall said: “Savers will find the number of deals (439) is at its highest since August 2019 (453), when choice peaked. Average interest rates offered across both easy access and notice ISAs stand at their highest since 2009, but the margin between the two (0.72 percent) stands at its highest on record.”  DON'T MISS: Three key tax allowance to maximise before they expire in April [EXPLAINED]Savings account 'to pay double inflation’ turning £10k into £12,462 [INSIGHT]Secondhand economy valued at £10 billion, as Brits strapped for cash [ANALYSIS]    Ms Springall continued: “A notice ISA may then be an alternative for savers who want a bit of flexibility, but desire a higher rate than may be on offer on an easy access ISA.” Research shows interest on easy access ISAs have seen a month-on-month increase, with average rates hitting 1.85 percent up from 0.24 percent in February 2021. The average notice ISA rate also reflected a large jump, with rates now hitting an average of 2.57 percent up from 0.4 percent in February 2021. Ms Springall said: “Those savers who prefer to fix their ISA cash will find the average one-year fixed ISA rate stands at its highest point since January 2009 and is a notable 2.82 percent higher than that of a year ago.” READ MORE: 500,000 savers forced to use pension pot to ‘make ends meet’  However, Ms Springall added that it is still imperative for savers to be conscious of their Personal Savings Allowance (PSA) in addition to their ISA allowance. The average rate on one-year fixed ISAs rose to 3.41 percent, the highest point since January 2009 (3.43 percent), while the average longer-term fixed ISA rate rose to 3.68 percent, which stands them at their highest point since June 2011 (3.70 percent). While fixed bond rates appear to be in much higher demand from savers, the number of those dipping into more savings flexible pots is still large, according to recent figures published by the Bank of England.  Ms Springall said: “There was an outflow of £1.2billion from interest-bearing sight deposits in December 2022 and demand for fixed accounts recorded an inflow of almost £7billion into time deposits. “Our own data shows volatility surrounding fixed bond rates has softened after recent months of uncertainty, with the average shelf life of fixed bonds rising to its highest level since May 2022, up from 29 days to 48 days, the biggest month-on-month rise in more than two years (December 2021).” However, Ms Springall pointed out that standout top rates don’t appear to be available for long, “particularly” if offered by a challenger bank that reaches its funding targets.
