 An area of woodland in Newcastle has been swarmed with police services after an investigation was launched. At present the cause of the investigation is unknown.    Specialist search teams are on the scene just off Amelia Walk in Benwell along with a number of other police vehicles, according to Chronicle Live. A Northumbria Police spokesman said: “Searches are ongoing in the Benwell area in connection with an ongoing investigation.” Police specialist search team officers arrived on the scene at 10am with tools to search through the undergrowth. Five police vehicles in total have been in the Newcastle woodland area since this morning. An area of woodland on Amelia Walk remains cordoned off.    Witnesses claim police have been in the area since Monday. A carer who has lived in the area for 47 years, Linda Johnson, 66, told Chronicle Live: "I went out on Monday and they were there. There was one car there all night. They must have been watching so nobody came on the scene." A mum, who lives near the wooded area but does not want to be identified, told the publication: "I wasn’t worried. If you don’t see police around here then you worry!" Local resident Yakub Ghbreslossie, 37, who is a student nurse, said: "My wife was worried about it. We feel like it’s not normal to see such things so we feel a little worried about it. We are living here so if something has happened it might affect us."
