Amanda Holden, 52, looked as stylish as ever in a dazzling glittery ensemble consisting of a blazer and straight-legged trousers. The Britain’s Got Talent judge completed last night’s look with silver pointed-toe heeled boots and a black crop top exposing her toned midriff. Amanda was over the moon after attending ABBA’s virtual concert residency, ABBA Voyage, which is held in a purpose-built venue at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in London. The fabulous radio presenter took to Instagram to share a series of snaps from the outing with her 1.9 million followers. In the pictures, Amanda could be seen smiling from ear to ear as she excitedly pointed at the ABBA sign. She captioned one of the shots: “Well. You don’t need me to say this is B****Y BRILLIANT BUT IT IS B****Y BRILLIANT @abbavoyage I wept with joy.”
