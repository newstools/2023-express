Schools and workplaces are being encouraged by celebrities including Sir Tom Jones to take part in a day of reflection to remember those who have died.  The national memorial on March 23 – the anniversary of the first Covid lockdown – is being organised by the charity Marie Curie. The end-of-life organisation said the third annual event was an “opportunity to reflect on any death of a loved one, from any cause and at any time”.  A national minute’s silence is planned for midday. The charity has asked communities to create a wall of reflection, to celebrate the lives of lost family and friends by sharing music, poems and memories as well as photographs. Sir Tom, 82, said: “Losing someone you love is devastating. Grief can so often feel very heavy, which is why Marie Curie’s National Day of Reflection is so important. It gives us all a moment in time to come together...to remember and celebrate the people who aren’t with us any more.” Other backers include charity ambassadors Gavin and Stacey’s Alison Steadman and Downton Abbey star Jim Carter. Marie Curie set up the event to remember people who died in the pandemic. Details at mariecurie.org.uk/dayofreflection
