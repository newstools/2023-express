If you want to get stuck into some new books then Amazon may have the perfect promotion. The online retailer has just launched an exclusive deal that is offering access to a million top titles for free... yes, you did read that correctly. The offer is available courtesy of Amazon's Kindle Unlimited service which offers instant access to some of the biggest bestsellers via a monthly subscription plan. It's a bit like Netflix but for bookworms. Amazon Kindle Unlimited usually costs £9.49 per month but, right now, there's the option to sign up and get two whole months for free - that's a total saving of £18.98. Along with free access to all those novels, biographies and fiction, there are also magazines to browse plus the ability to listen to unlimited audiobooks as well. Another bonus of this deal is that you can use the Unlimited platform on numerous devices including phones and tablets thanks to the Kindle app. It's even available on all Apple and Android devices so even if you forget your eReader you won't be bored on a train journey or long-haul flight. The only thing that's worth remembering is that the deal only lasts for those first two months and, unless you cancel, you will then be placed onto the standard £9.49 subscription plan. If you don't want to continue using Kindle Unlimited it's easy to cancel via your online account. To claim the free period you'll also need to be a Prime member although it is worth noting that Amazon also has a free promotion on this service as well. As a quick reminder, Prime not only includes free speedy delivery but also access to Prime Video and Music. There is also unlimited photo storage in Amazon Cloud Drive and Kindle First gives Prime members early access to download a new book every month at no additional cost from the Kindle First picks.
