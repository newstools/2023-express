 Emilia is a cosmetic and fragrance influencer who shares reviews and insights into the world of perfume and aftershave, taking on the alias "Professor Perfume". She claims that consumers could extend the shelf life of their chosen fragrances simply by paying attention to where they are storing them on a daily basis. "It's come to my attention that nobody on TikTok or Pinterest knows the proper way to store perfume," she explained in a video for her audience of 308.7K followers. Emilia captioned the video exclaiming: "I can't take it anymore." She said that she has a "visceral reaction" when she notices people storing bottles of perfume on their bathroom counters. She explained: "If you keep your perfume in the bathroom when you shower, all of the steam, all of the temperature fluctuations are going to spot your perfume a lot faster than if you store them correctly." However, this doesn't necessarily mean you can simply move your perfume to a dressing table or window sill. Emilia warns that these locations are equally detrimental to your scents.
