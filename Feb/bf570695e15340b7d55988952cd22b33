Meghan and Harry have been urged to "move back to the UK" as Americans are becoming fed up with the couple's antics. The comments come amid outcry following the release couple's Netflix series and Prince Harry's bombshell memoir, Spare. "I am going to tell you something you do not want to hear, in the States the conversation is Harry and Meghan need to apologise and they need to move back to the UK," said LA-based royal expert Kinsey Schofield. She added: "That is what we are saying here in America, that they need to move back to the UK. I know that is the last thing Brits want." The host of the To Di For Daily podcast told GB News that Americans have realised the "only interesting thing" about the Sussexes was their connection to other royals. She added: "They are not interesting people, they're not exciting people, there's nothing inside of them.  "They don't provide anything and I think that what we liked about them was their relation to the British Royal Family, so I think that they've got to be closer to the British Royal Family." Ms Schofield added that the couple's "oversharing" didn't help matters, citing Harry's adventures with Elizabeth Arden Cream and his frostbitten penis. The comments come following a devastating opinion poll which shows the Sussexes' popularity plummeting in the United States. The recent poll showed Prince Harry's favourability rating drop 45 points from +38 in December to -7 in January.

"And the problem with fame, which Meghan Markle has chased all of her life, is that the bigger you get, the more the public holds you accountable."  The Sussexes stepped down as working royals in 2020 and eventually landed in Montecito, California where they live with their two children, Archie, three, and Lilibet, one.
