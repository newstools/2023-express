Kell Brook has apologised after a video made the rounds of him appearing to snort white powder inside his home. The recently retired boxer was seen bent over a coffee table in his kitchen using a roll-up to consume the powder as the 36-year-old muttered "nice" after the act. Taking to Twitter, he wrote: "I messed up,I hold my hands up & want to apologise to my family gym friends & fans It’s no secret that I struggle with mental health & I’m finding retirement really hard. I’m actively seeking the help I need to get me on the right path. Again i apologise for the hurt I’ve caused. "It’s no secret that I struggle with mental health & I’m finding retirement really hard. I’m actively seeking the help I need to get me on the right path. Again i apologise for the hurt I’ve caused." The video was published by The Sun and quickly made it around social media. One witness told the publication: "He had a bit of a gathering at his house where people were drinking spirits and smoking. He was snorting white powder." Although his manager Terry Thompson insisted it was “a joke” at the time. Brook retired from professional boxing last year after beating fierce rival Amir Khan in their long-awaited grudge match at the AO Arena, Manchester. Announcing his intentions to step away from the sport in May, he told The Telegraph: "I've had a long chat with my family and my parents, and it's over for me. I'll never box again. It's a little emotional to be actually saying this out loud. My mum is relieved. I think everyone around me is pleased.
