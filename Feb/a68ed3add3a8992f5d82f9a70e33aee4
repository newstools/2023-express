34-year-old Bridgerton fave Rege-Jean Page's blushes were not spared when he landed on the ground before so much as even entering the event. His girlfriend Emily Brown was initially completely oblivious to his plight and simply walked on, making it all the more embarrassing.

The star, who is hotly tipped to become the next James Bond, slipped on a black velvet blazer over his trousers and waistcoat and wowed the crowds.
