His pleas for tax cuts will resonate with Conservative’s up and down the country who want Rishi Sunak to release the fiscal handbrake. The current inhabitant of No.10 has steadied the ship since the tumultuous fallout from Liz Truss’s emergency budget in September. But Tory backbenchers are also growing restless and want their boss to add a bit more juice to help the economic recovery. They argue that cutting taxes would have the double effect of boosting growth and easing the burden on hard-pressed families. Not only that, tax cuts could prove hugely popular with the electorate. Whether he is planning a comeback or not, Mr Johnson is certainly saying the things that many within the party, and outside, want to hear. The message here is that Boris Johnson is the “Heineken politician” – he refreshes those parts of the Tory party and electorate that the other politicians and Prime Ministers cannot reach. Being free from the shackles of government enables him to be bold. Cutting taxes and demanding fighter jets and more tanks for Ukraine to bring a swift end to the Russian invasion are clear examples. But the one other thing he brings to the party (excuse the pun) is hope. When Boris Johnson says his party can win the next general election, many Conservatives believe it. And they see him as the Prince Across the Water should things begin to go badly awry for Mr Sunak.
