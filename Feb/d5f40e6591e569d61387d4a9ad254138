Prince Harry has been blasted for his "self-delusion and arrogance" by political commentator and author Ben Shapiro, who shared his insight after reading Harry's memoir Spare. He also claimed that the Duke of Sussex had now lost his "source of value" by spilling the secrets of the Royal Family and there was nothing left for him to do but "shout a lot". Speaking to Piers Morgan on Sky News Australia, the Daily Wire co-creator criticised Harry and Meghan Markle's sense of "untouchability", commenting: "If you say something that crosses them, you hurt their feelings, they get very upset. "He [Harry] wants privacy, but he has very specific memories of using particular facial cream." The past few months have seen the release of Spare, Meghan's podcast Archetypes and their Netflix documentary series Harry & Meghan. However, Mr Shapiro said that he does not believe there is a "next step" for the couple following a barrage of allegations made against the royals. He said: "Once you actually destroy your source of value, which is the inside view of the monarchy and youâ€™ve already spilled that, what is there to do other than just stand outside and shout a lot?" Harry and Meghan's popularity since Spare was published has plummeted, with a new poll showing their approval ratings are at an all-time low in the US. According to research conducted by Redfield & Wilton for Newsweek on February 19, Harry was liked by 32 percent and disliked by 42 percent of respondents, with his approval date dropping from -7 on January 16 to -10 last week.

Meghan was even more unpopular than her husband, as she was liked by 27 percent of Americans and disliked by 44 percent. This gave her a net approval rating of -17 on February 19, with Mr Shapiro saying the public reaction to the Sussexes was "heartening".
