Jake Paul reeled off the excuses after losing to Tommy Fury on points. The Problem Child explained that he had been ill in the lead-up to the fight and had injured his arm as fans booed the YouTuber-turned-boxer for his lack of humility. Speaking to Radio Rahim in the immediate aftermath, Paul said: "All respect to Tommy, he won. Don't judge me by my wins, judge me by my losses. "I'll come back and I think we deserve the rematch. It was a great fight, a close fight. I don't know if I agree with the judges. I got a 10-8 round twice. It is what it is but I've already won in life. I've won in every single way, I have amazing family, amazing friends and an amazing work ethic." "Honestly, I felt flat, I got sick really bad twice in this camp, and injured my arm," added Paul as boos rang around the Diriyah Arena. "But I lost, I'm not making excuses. It wasn't my best performance."  Paul now has the option to exercise the rematch clause in his contract with Fury. When asked whether he would be activating it, Paul replied: "one hundred per cent, let's run it back." Meanwhile, an ecstatic Fury gave an emotional speech of his own post-fight. "For the past two years, this is all that has consumed my life! Everybody thought I was running scared but tonight I make my own legacy! This was for you Bambi I love you!" MORE BOXING NEWS...
