Cat Deeley, 46, and Liam Payne's girlfriend Kate Cassidy, 23, attended the British Vogue and TiffanyÂ BAFTA after party on Sunday night wearing the exact same dress. Liam and Kate seem to have arrived first to private members' club, Annabel's, and the blonde beauty looked incredible in her floor-length gold gown. Cat was later photographed in the same figure-hugging dress, looking equally as glamorous. Kate, who is from New Jersey but now lives in London, has been dating One Direction star Liam since October. Before striking up their romance, Liam was previously in a relationship with Cheryl - with whom he shares son Bear - and engaged to model Maya Henry for around one year.
