Tributes have been paid to an "amazing" dad who died hours after "joking around" with his family. Sam Mercer had been recovering at home following surgery on Valentine's Day for a snapped femur he sustained in December last year.    However, on Sunday, February 19, the 35-year-old died suddenly. His brother, Tom Hanlon, said Sam was "recovering well" before getting a call on Sunday evening to find out he was being taken to hospital. By the time Tom arrived at Sam's house in Crosby, Merseyside, he had already died.   Tom told The Liverpool Echo: "I spoke to him at 11am that day and he was fine, he was joking around. "Then I got the call went round and the paramedics and police were there. They came out to say he was already dead. "I just don't know what we are going to do without him. He just loved life and was always the soul of the party. "Sam had the most incredible sense of humour, he got on with everybody and would light up a room. He truly just loved everyone and was the best dad." Sam, a dad-of-three, was the landlord of the Volunteer Canteen pub in Waterloo, Merseyside, which his brother said was like his "baby". A post on the pub's Facebook page about Sam's death has already got nearly 400 likes and 200 comments. Sam's family is waiting to find out how he died, and a postmortem has yet to take place. Tom said: "It does not feel real, it's like we are in a nightmare and it has shaken us all to the core, especially my mum. "Christmas won't be the same without him, he was always the one to get us laughing and joking around. "It just makes no sense, he was so fit and went to the gym all the time. "He was always getting the kids out and about and was trying to stay active during his surgery. "I just want to get across what an amazing man he was and how much he meant to everyone. Life will never be the same without him."  Sam leaves behind three children, wife Jenny, mum Susan, dad Andrew, and his siblings Tom, Ben, Jack, Andrew, Matthew, Becky, and Vicky.
