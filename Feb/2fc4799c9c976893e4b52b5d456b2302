A video posted on TikTok went viral after a tourist seemed to anger a King's Guard as she grabbed at his horse's reins while posing for a photograph. She was seen approaching the soldier and yanking at the animal's reins, prompting a furious reaction from the guardsman.   In the short clip, the soldier can be heard shouting “Get off” angrily as the woman smiles at the camera. After the King’s Guard loudly exclaimed “Get off the reins”, the woman leapt back in surprise. However, the angry outburst did not stop the tourist from going in for a second attempt to secure her photograph. This prompted a louder “Get off” from the guard, causing the woman to give up on her posed picture.
