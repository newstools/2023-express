Russia has suffered "extremely high casualties" in Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast, a map tweeted by the UK Ministry of Defence has indicated. Meanwhile, Ukraine is planning a spring counteroffensive in a bid to liberate Crimea with an intelligence chief warning Moscow: “We won’t stop.” DefenceHQ tweeted: "Imagery shows concentrated Russian vehicle losses in the Vuhledar sector of Donetsk Oblast. These vehicles were likely elements of Russia’s 155th Naval Infantry (NI) Brigade which has been at the forefront of recent costly offensives. NI is seen as an elite infantry force within the Russian military. "Unlike the similarly prestigious airborne infantry (VDV), NI has not deployed as a single large formation in Ukraine. Instead, individual units have been attached to Ground Forces-dominated Groups of Forces As such, NI has been tasked with some of the toughest tactical missions in the war and has suffered extremely high casualties." It added: "The supposedly enhanced capability of NI brigades has now almost certainly been significantly degraded because it has been backfilled with inexperienced mobilised personnel." Russian President Vladimir Putin is believed to be planning to pour more troops into the country in an attempt to conquer his neighbour. Speaking to the German newspaper Deutsche Welle, Vadym Skibitskyi, Deputy Chief of Ukraine's Defence Intelligence, said the key Black Sea peninsula, annexed by Russia in 2014, was at the forefront of his thinking. Stressing that the counteroffensive was “to liberate all of the occupied territories of Ukraine, including Crimea”, he added: “We will only stop when we restore our country to its 1991 borders.” THIS IS A LIVE BLOG.
