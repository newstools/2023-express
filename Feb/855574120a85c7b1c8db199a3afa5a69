A former Tory MP who sexually assaulted a 15-year-old boy is set to be released from prison after serving only half his sentence. Imran Ahmed Khan, 48 was jailed for 18 months after being found guilty in May last year. The Times reports that the former MP for Wakefield is due to be released on probation as early as today. During the trial the court heard that Khan forced the boy to drink gin at a party in 2008 before taking him upstairs, pushing him onto a bed and asking him to watch pornography before the attack. A picture showed him leaving jail this morning the former MP appeared with long hair and a beard after serving nine months of his sentence. He was pictured leaving HMP Brixton, in south London at around 10.15am. Since the trial, Khan has appealed against his sentence and conviction, but both were upheld as he maintains his innocence. Judge Jeremy Baker, sentencing said he displayed a "significant degree of brutality". He added: "“The only regret you feel is towards yourself for having found yourself in the predicament you face as a result of your actions some 14 years ago.  The victim told the court he was "scared, vulnerable, numb, shocked and surprised" after the incident but did not want to make a formal complaint. Only in 2019 when Khan ran in the General Election did the victim say the memories "came flooding back". Khan, who is gay, claimed denied the charge claiming he only touched the teenager's elbow when he “became extremely upset” during a conversation about his confused sexuality. Khan's conviction triggered a by-election in the Wakefield district which was won by Labour’s Simon Lightwood in June.
