A YouTuber captured the moment he heard an almighty 'crack' and feared that the Wheel of Liverpool was going to collapse. YouTube Channel Exposure TV shared a video to its online platform claiming to show the aftermath after something appeared to have fallen from "the top" of the wheel. In the video, viewers can see what looks to be a wheel on the floor as the creator, known as Exposure TV, said he'd "never seen anything like it." Speaking to the Liverpool Echo, he said he was out walking on Thursday (February 9) at around 7.30pm with his family, filming another YouTube video, when he heard a "crack". But he added he put it down to the wind until hearing what he claims was an "almighty noise" He added: "I thought the actual ride was going to fall down on us. We were walking past and I remember hearing an almighty noise and it sounded like the whole thing was collapsing on us. The noise of it was unbelievable, it must've come from the top and it smashed right where people queue." In the video, staff members can be heard offering their reassurances as they said: "The wheel's just fallen off but don't worry." They then added the attraction will be "back open tomorrow."  The Wheel of Liverpool has 42 viewing pods and has been operating at the waterfront since 2010, previously being dismantled for refurbishment. It closed briefly in 2012 after its original operator, Great City Attractions, went into administration but is now run by Freij World Attractions. The ECHO has attempted to contact Freij World Attractions for comment.  A spokesperson for Liverpool City Council said no official complaint had been received, but it had referred the incident to the Health and Safety Executive.
