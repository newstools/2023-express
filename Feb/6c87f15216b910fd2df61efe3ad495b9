Pictures of a sheep with one horn at the centre of its head have circulated online, baffling people across the UK. The animal has attracted a lot of attention due to the fact it is a female sheep with a horn on its head. It has since been nicknamed a "Ewe-nicorn". Reddit users shared their excitement online, with one branding the "Ewe-nicorn" pun "he most underrated comment I've ever seen on Reddit." They added: "I have nothing to give you aside from recognition that this was brilliant and best joke I've seen on here in a long time." The same user then joked about how the female sheep could have managed to grow a horn. He wrote: "Don't joke! This is very serious. A sheep will only do this when it is startled, scared, or feeling sexy." Another user joked that: "Just a d***head, like all sheep." The first user then responded: "They have one focus in life, which is to find new and interesting ways to die. When one achieves this aim, any of the others which see it think 'cool, I’m trying that'. Because they’re all d***heads." Another Reddit poster said the sheep could have grown the horn for "self-defence".
