The Royal Family have been urged to conduct a tour of Australia to bring “the Monarchy to the people” Down Under to offset the growing Republican movement. But do you think Prince William should be the one to showcase the Monarchy? Vote in our poll. Former senator for Tasmania and new campaign director for the Australian Monarchist League (AML), Eric Abetz, believes a royal tour by either King Charles III or the Prince of Wales would help “bolster” affection for the Monarchy in the Commonwealth nation. He told Express.co.uk: “There is no doubt a royal visit would bolster the sentiment for the constitutional monarchy. The passing of Her Majesty and the associated media coverage brought the monarchy to the people and they liked what they saw. A visit would have a similar impact. Either the King or Prince William visiting would be most welcomed by the Australian people.” READ MORE: Charles and William can 'bring the monarchy to the people'–campaigner He continued: “Prince William would remind people of the stability and continuity of the Monarchy whereas the King would remind people of the seamless transition and how His Majesty has immediately assumed the role with grace and dignity in the finest of traditions for a constitutional monarch.” William first travelled to Australia as a baby in the early Eighties and last went with Kate, Princess of Wales and nine-month-old Prince George in 2014. The couple had been due to visit Australia in early 2020, to meet with people affected by the bushfire crisis, but the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic resulted in it being cancelled. The AML said in September that William and Kate could conduct a tour of Australia in 2023. So what do YOU think? Should William visit Australia?
