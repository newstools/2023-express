  Actress Pamela Anderson, 55, has explained how she is ready to “do battle” with her mother after the release of her memoir, Love, Pamela. The star’s explosive new book, which sees her take back control of her own narrative for the very first time, has apparently prompted “horrible comments” from her mum Carol.     Pamela explained how, despite her many marriages, one relationship preoccupying her now is with her mother. Both of the actress’ parents now live with her in her house after the star generously opened her home to them. She said she had “imagined everyone here and happy. But it’s just, like, knife-throwing. Mothers and daughters, right? Bizarre digs and jabs and cruel little things.” The Baywatch star went on to reveal that, after reading the autobiography, her mother was not best pleased.

So it’s going to be very difficult for her to have that out there,” Pamela revealed in the interview with the Sunday Times. “I’m not going into this to hurt anyone’s feelings. She usually only cares about her hair and I said, ‘Come on, Mom, I talked about your hair in great detail!’ “But none of this is going to be easy for her. So this is our big year, our battle year, and I’m kind of curious to see how it’s all going to unfold. I hope we can be closer.” Pamela also went on to talk about small ways her mother would get at her now that the pair lived together.     The actress claimed her mother would fill her fridge with eggs despite knowing she was a vegan - and that she tried to convince her that her front tooth was rotting. She also said that her brother Gerry was “the saint” in her mother’s eyes - and that he is resentful towards her because “it just hasn’t happened for him”. The star even suggested that her mother and brother bond over “how much trouble I’ve caused everybody”. During the interview, she also mocked the pair for asking “how dare she write about her own life?”. READ MORE...

Pamela has been married a total of six times over the past 28 years, starting with Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy in 1995. The pair later divorced in 1998 after their marriage broke down following the couple’s infamous leaked sex tape. The actress went on to marry musician Kid Rock eight years later, but they quickly divorced the following year.     Pamela then married professional poker player Rick Salomon twice – once in 2007, and again in 2014, with each marriage lasting for one year. Her shortest marriage came in 2020 when she tied the knot with longtime friend, the film producer Jon Peters, and the pair stayed together for just 12 days. Finally, Pamela’s self-described “worst marriage” came in 2020, when she said “I do” to builder Dan Hayhurst, whom she hired to work on the renovation of her childhood home. The pair later divorced in 2022 and Pamela has since been single in what she has described as “the best year of her life”. You can buy Love, Pamela from Waterstones, Amazon and other retailers now.
