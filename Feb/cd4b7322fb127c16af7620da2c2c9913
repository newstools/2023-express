Intended as a tribute to her and the women who rallied around to support her, it was made into a hit movie two years later with Dolly Parton, Sally Field and Julia Roberts. This touring version is a timely reminder of Harling’s scintillating, bittersweet script that provides wonderful roles for an all-female cast.  Set in Louisiana in a small-town beauty salon run by the irrepressible Truvy (Lucy Speed, channelling Dolly Parton superbly), it is a loose, episodic story about a disparate group of women who use the salon as an unofficial social centre and retreat from husbands, housework and the humdrummery of their daily lives. Pivoting around the impending marriage of Shelby (Diana Vickers) whose charmed life is blighted by diabetes, it celebrates the loyalties, rivalries and mutual support of women’s friendship.  Harling’s script is packed full of comedy stingers (“The nicest thing I can say about her is that all her tattoos are spelt correctly”) that the ensemble delivers with aplomb. On an authentic-looking, if wobbly set, big hair is backcombed into huge hair, curlers are applied or removed with professional ease and hair is washed over a sink by newcomer Annelle (Elizabeth Ayodele) who harbours secrets of her own.  Anthony Banks’s direction is simple and uncomplicated with a set reversal halfway through that delivers a different perspective. Each character is vividly coloured even if the acting and the southern accents are variable. Harriet Thorpe (Fleur in Absolutely Fabulous) brings a comforting bitchiness to sharp-tongued Ouiser (“I’m not crazy, I’ve just been in a very bad mood for 40 years”) and Shelby’s aching decision to have children against doctor’s orders is conveyed without overdoing the sentimentality. There’s laughter, tears and wigs galore.
