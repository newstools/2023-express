Ben Ofoedu, 50, was spotted on a night out for the first time following his split from This Morning star Vanessa Feltz, 61. The Phats and Small singer could be seen enjoying the company of another blonde beauty, Elle Brooke, who rose to fame through her OnlyFans platform. Elle, who claims to earn over Â£30,000 a month via OnlyFans, has since embarked on another path, in celebrity crossover boxing, and won her first match against ex-Love Islander AJ Bunker. In the exclusive photos, Elle seemed to be waiting for Ben outside the pub before the pair were seen sharing a tender hug and a cosy chat. They then headed inside the venue together to watch the Tommy Fury v Jake Paul fight. Ben, who was dumped by a heartbroken Vanessa after she found out he had been having an affair, spent three hours at the pub before leaving alone and rushing to a waiting car. Express.co.uk has contacted Ben and Elle's reps for comment.
