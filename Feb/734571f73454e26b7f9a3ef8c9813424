Street artists Banky has debuted a new Valentine's Day piece, marking the first piece in the UK for over a year. The artwork spotted in Margate, Kent appears to highlight domestic violence with a 1950s housewife sporting washing-up gloves, a black eye and a missing tooth as she pushes a man, presumably her husband, into a freezer. Banksy shared a series of photos of the artwork on social media with the heading 'Valentine's day mascara', zooming in to show a close up of the woman's bruised face. The piece is set on a white wall backdrop, with users online speculating it is off Grosvenor Place in Margate. It also features a variety of rubbish on the ground in front of the artwork, including a broken white garden chair, a blue crate and an empty beer bottle.  The artwork is Banky's first back in Britain for over a year after the anonymous graffiti artist announced they had created 50 screenprints which would be sold to raise funds for a charity supporting the people of Ukraine. Banksy also spent time in Ukraine after posting a video of an artist spray-painting designs in the war-torn country and speaking to locals.
