They will share up to £150,000 after an inquest at Beaconsfield Coroners Court ruled it treasure. The find – the Hambleden Hoard – was unearthed at Culden Faw Estate, Bucks, in April 2019. It includes 12 “extremely rare” gold nobles from Edward III’s reign, dating 1346 to 1351. The detectorists, some friends, some strangers, banded together after first hitting a thimble and shotgun shells. The team of Andrew Winter, Dom Rapley, Eryk Wierucki, Jaroslaw Giedyna, Dariusz Fijalkowski and brothers Tobiasz and Mateusz Nowak camped at the site to protect it. They said it got “absolutely hectic” when word got round the festival, with people coming to watch them. The British Museum will take the treasure and fix a fee with the finders and landowners.
