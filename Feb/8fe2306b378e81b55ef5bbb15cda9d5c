A young cabin crew member suddenly died after her plane landed at Stansted Airport, an inquest heard today. Greta Dyrmishi, 24, fainted upon arrival at the airport on the Air Albania plane. First aid and CPR was provided but Ms Dyrmishi was tragically declared died at a hospital in London. The woman's inquest, which opened today, heard she suffered sudden adult death syndrome, an umbrella term used for the many different causes of cardiac arrest in young people. Michelle Brown, area coroner for Essex, said Ms Dyrmishi had no pulse minutes after collapsing near the front door of the plane on December 21, reports Essex Live. Ms Brown added: "This 24-year-old female was cabin crew on a flight from Albania and was on the tarmac when she appeared to faint and was given basic first aid. "Ten minutes later there was no pulse and CPR commenced. Paramedics treated her and confirmed she had passed away. A post-mortem found her cause of death to be sudden adult death syndrome. "At the time of the incident, she was at the front by the doors on a plane at Stansted Airport. This is suitable for a documentary inquest in due course."  A statement issued by Air Albania at the time of Greta's death said: "On December 21, after disembarking the passengers from our flight to London, one of our cabin crew Greta Dyrmishi had a heart attack. Even after all medical assistance was provided immediately, we still lost her.  "She was taken to the hospital in London, and procedures are being followed. From the first moments, Air Albania contacted her family, and we continue to be close to them in these difficult moments. "In respect to Greta and her family, we decided to share the news with the public at the appropriate time. We will always remember Greta as a passionate professional, an excellent coworker, and a great friend to all of us. "May God mercy her and give peace to the family. Air Albania will continue to be with her family."
