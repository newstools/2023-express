A driver had pleaded guilty to causing the death of a mum after his Range Rover went onto train tracks in a horrific crash. Yagmur Ozden, 33, was a passenger in the car when she was killed in August last year, after it ploughed into a stationary Tesla and smashed through a wall, somersaulting through the air and finally landing on the tracks at Park Royal station in Ealing, West London.    The £120,000 vehicle was left destroyed by the incident. Now its driver, Rida Kazem, 23, has pleaded guilty to causing Yagmur’s death, as well as causing serious injury to a second passenger of the car. When he was found on the platform of the station, Rida was placed in an induced coma. His left leg had to be amputated, and he remained in hospital for several months. An inquest was told previously that beautician Yagmur, from Baghdad, was declared dead at the scene about 40 minutes after the crash. Police could only identify her through her fingerprints after the mum-of-one was thrown from the car. The cause of her death was ruled as multiple traumatic injuries and blunt force trauma in a post mortem. Her family described her as an “angel”, highlighting her “amazing bond” with her 12-year-old daughter. They added: “Her daughter will always cherish those moments she had with her mum. She was very funny and could cheer up the saddest person instantly, putting them in a better mood.” Meanwhile Yagmur’s best friend, Zamarod Arif, 26, left the crash with a broken arm and broken leg. She said she was “so lucky to be alive.” A 56-year-old man, who is believed to have been with the parked Tesla when the Range Rover hit it, was treated for non life-threatening injuries. Kazem was remanded in custody to be sentenced on April 21 at Isleworth Crown Court. The A40 was closed in West London and the Piccadilly Line was suspended in the area following the crash.
