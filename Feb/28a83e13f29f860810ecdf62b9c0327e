The shocking moment a woman threw a broccoli at another shopper in Lidl was caught on camera as the video divided viewers. Sisters Afsaneh and Hanieh, from Manchester, posted footage of the heated row on TikTok yesterday after visiting their local supermarket in Salford. The sisters said: "This woman was screaming and shouting at an innocent man just for going on his phone at the self-checkout. "Nobody wanted to speak up to protect him, so we spoke up and said calm down and got fully attacked."  Lidl staff were forced to intervene as the women shouted at each other. The woman can be heard saying: "Wait until you get outside. Who asked you to get involved?" When one of the sisters pointed out that the woman is being recorded, she said: "Do you actually think I'm a**ed? "You started it, you stupid cow.  "Shut your mouth. Does your camera bother me, cocky b******? "I wasn't speaking to you, you got yourself involved."

She paid double just to launch it."
