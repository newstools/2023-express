Brooklyn Beckham, 23, was intent on creating a romantic surprise for Nicola to mark their first Valentine's Day as a married couple - but fans had questions about his choice of attire. The bare-chested aspiring chef, whose tattoo collection rivals that of his famous footballer dad David, clutched a heart-shaped tree planted in a bed of faux grass and made up of dozens of red roses. The romantic gesture seemed to symbolise the pair growing their love - but fans questioned why, if he was totally nude aside from a towel, he was still wearing a baseball cap. Branding it an epic fail, followers including @eviewivi quizzed on Instagram: "Ok, but why is he only wearing a towel but with a hat....?" "Exactly my thoughts," a chuckling @mariamishi shot back, joking: "Maybe [it's a] new fashion?"
