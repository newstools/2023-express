The new Implementation Strategy follows the horrific deaths in 2020 of six-year-old Arthur Labinjo-Hughes and Star Hobson, 16 months – both murdered by their parents’ partners. The strategy will mean police, teachers and social workers will be able to intervene earlier in cases where neglect is suspected. And it will be easier for relatives to look after youngsters under threat rather than see them taken into care. Arthur and Star’s cases sparked widespread criticism after it emerged child protection professionals in councils, schools and police forces had failed to act, even after relatives spoke out. More than 400,000 children in England need social care. Claire Coutinho, minister for children, families and wellbeing, who writes in the Daily Express today, said the reforms will “put strong relationships at the heart of the care system”. NSPCC chief Sir Peter Wanless welcomed the strategy but called for the creation of a “Minister for Children”. He said: “There is a vision for reform, a focus on stable and loving homes and a real intent to finally get things right. “But at the same time we need a commitment for substantial, national investment and a reform programme delivered at greater pace.” The strategy will be piloted in 12 local authorities, which will get £45million to build the best system, before it is rolled out to others.
