Nicola Sturgeon has given a press conference from Bute House this morning, in which she announced her resignation as First Minister after more than eight years in the role. The SNP leader appeared to admit defeat on her Scottish independence dream, saying she wants her party to choose its plan for pursuing Scottish independence without the influence of a leader who might not be around to carry it out. She said: "I free the SNP to choose the path that believes to be the right one." "We're at a critical moment", she warned, saying "the cause of independence is bigger than any one individual."
