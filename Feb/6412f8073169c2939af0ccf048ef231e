Michael Flatley, 64, was at the Bord Gais Energy Theatre in Dublin for his famous Irish Dance spectacleâ€™s homecoming event this week. The sportsman looked happier than ever as he posed alongside his wife Niamh O'Brien on the red carpet in a black suit. He paired the suit with an open-buttoned white shirt, while Niamh looked lovely in a paisley-patterned belted dress. This comes as the star announced last month that he had been released from hospital following his diagnosis with an aggressive, but undisclosed, form of cancer He told The Irish Sun at the event: "I am a fighter. I am not giving up and I will beat this." Michael had previously fought melanoma in 2003 after a fan noticed a worrying mark on his face during an interview with MTV.
