Rishi Sunak has hit out at a publisher for “airbrushing” Roald Dahl books by cutting allegedly offensive words. An aide said that he believed works of fiction should be “preserved”, and he defended the right to free speech.   Words such as fat, black and white have been axed from children’s classics including The BFG and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory in case they upset readers. The PM’s spokesman said he thought it was wrong to “gobblefunk” around with words – a term Dahl used in The BFG. He said: “When it comes to our rich and varied literary heritage, the Prime Minister agrees with The BFG that we shouldn’t gobblefunk around with words. It’s important that works of literature and works of fiction are preserved and not airbrushed. We have always defended the right to free speech.” The Roald Dahl Story Company and Puffin Books said they carried out a review of the works to make them suitable for current audiences. References to mental health, violence and gender have also been altered in extensive rewrites.   Succession actor Brian Cox has said the books are “of their time and they should be left alone”. He added: “Dahl was a great satirist, apart from anything else. His children’s work is full of satirical edge.” He added of the rewrite: “It’s disgraceful. It’s a kind of form of McCarthyism...which is absolutely wanting to reinterpret everything and redesign and say, ‘Oh, that didn’t exist’. Well, it did exist. We have to acknowledge our history.” Best-selling author Salman Rushdie called the changes “absurd censorship” and said that the organisations “should be ashamed”. His Dark Materials author Sir Philip Pullman said Dahl’s works could be left to “fade away” as tastes change. He said: “If Dahl offends us, let him go out of print.” Dahl, who died in 1990 aged 74, often tops lists of favourite authors. His family have apologised for the “lasting and understandable hurt” after he made anti-Semitic comments.
