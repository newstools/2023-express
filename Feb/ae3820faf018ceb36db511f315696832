Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has travelled to Northern Ireland to hold talks with Stormont party leaders as speculation over a Brexit deal grows. A deal on post-Brexit reading arrangements reportedly could be reached as early as next week. But do you think the Prime Minister should compromise with the European Union to secure a breakthrough? Vote in our poll. The Northern Ireland Protocol was agreed upon as part of the UK’s withdrawal from the bloc to ensure the free movement of goods across the land border with the Republic of Ireland, which remains in the EU. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) oppose the Protocol and claim the checks have driven a wedge between Great Britain to Northern Ireland. A spokesperson from 10 Downing Street said on Thursday night: “Whilst talks with the EU are ongoing, ministers continue to engage with relevant stakeholders to ensure any solution fixes the practical problems on the ground, meets our overarching objectives, and safeguards Northern Ireland's place in the UK's internal market. “The Prime Minister and secretary of state for Northern Ireland are travelling to Northern Ireland this evening to speak to political parties as part of this engagement process.” READ MORE: Sunak warned he needs 'laser-like focus' to deliver Brexit deal Mr Sunak has also reportedly scheduled a meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen this weekend on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
