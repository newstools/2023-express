Newcastle's hopes of a first trophy since 1955 were dashed by Manchester United at Wembley in the Carabao Cup final on Sunday. Casemiro and a Sven Botman own goal were enough to down Eddie Howe's Magpies in what was the club's first cup final since May 1999. Express Sport rates and slates Newcastle's players after a disappointing evening under the arch. Loris Karius - 7 Thrown back into the spotlight after Nick Pope’s inopportune red card last weekend and held up well considering his lack of football. Kieran Trippier - 7 The Newcastle captain was involved in most of his side’s handful of promising moments with his overlapping down the right. Fabian Schar - 6 Surprising he stayed on after clashing of heads with Lisandro Martinez which left him needing prolonged treatment. Sven Botman - 5 Own goal and a booking for throwing the ball down petulantly. Not the cup final he dreamed of. Dan Burn - 6 A proud day for the boy from Blyth but no fairytale. Wasted Newcastle’s best opportunity with off-target first half header. Bruno Guimaraes - 7 Back from three-match suspension, he gave everything to try to put Newcastle on the front foot but to no avail. Sean Longstaff - 6 Goalscoring hero of the semi-final against Southampton but substituted at half-time at Wembley to make way for Alexander Isak. Joelinton - 6 Deployed in midfield with Joe Willock not fit enough to start, main impact was booking for the ungainly scragging of Casemiro. Miguel Almiron - 5 Lots of energy but very little in the way of end product from the Paraguayan. Allan Saint-Maximin - 6 Stood up Diogo Dalot with one nice swift-shoe shuffle but could not influence the game sufficiently. Callum Wilson - 5 Ineffectual display from Newcastle’s spearhead, admittedly without much in the way of service. Alexander Isak (Longstaff 46) - 6 Jacob Murphy (Saint-Maximin 78) - N/A Joe Willock (Guimaraes 79) - N/A Matt Ritchie (Wilson 90+1) - N/A Elliott Anderson (Almiron 90+1) - N/A
