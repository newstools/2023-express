During the same period, approval of King Charles III and Queen Consort Camilla and Prince William and Princess Kate also fell, although not by the same amount. Speaking to the Times, journalist Christopher Andersen said: “The Netflix documentary marked a turning point. “There was the torrent of complaints, many of which seemed, for want of a better word, petty. The whining did not go over well with Americans.” Alongside the general public, reports suggest Harry and Meghan are falling out of favour with the American glitterati.

This factor is reportedly also under consideration in regard to their presence, or lack of, at the Coronation of King Charles III.  Reports suggest the King is hoping to convince the Sussexes to attend the Coronation, due to occur on May 6, as their presence would be less of a distraction than their absence. Sources have told the Mail on Sunday the King has asked the Archbishop of Canterbury to act as an intermediary between the Royal Family and the Sussexes in the hope of making a deal. Part of the deal could include prominent seating at the ceremony and assurances the would be able to keep their titles. As in the United States, the popularity of Harry and Meghan has also fallen in the UK, and their attendance of the Coronation in May looks uncertain.
