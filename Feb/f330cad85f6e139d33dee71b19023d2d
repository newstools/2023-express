Joe Biden has touched down in Kyiv and announced an extra £415million funding package for Ukraine. The 46th POTUS was spotted alongside his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky at Mikhailivska Square as air raid sirens blared out across the city. The pair laid wreaths at the Wall of Remembrance for the fallen heroes of the Russian-Ukrainian war as both leaders paid their respects. "He thought he could outlast us. But he was dead wrong." He continued: "I will announce another delivery of critical equipment, including artillery ammunition, anti-armor systems, and air surveillance radars to help protect the Ukrainian people from aerial bombardments. "And I will share that later this week, we will announce additional sanctions against elites and companies that are trying to evade or backfill Russia’s war machine." Ukraine's Defence Ministry welcomed Biden's arrival in Kyiv, saying the ex-Soviet state's "most reliable partner ... sends a powerful message to our enemy".  Ahead of the meeting, Zelensky said: "Today we host President Biden ... That is so important ... Thank you so much for coming Mr President at a huge moment for Ukraine." Afterwards, he added: "Today our negotiations were very fruitful ... They were very important and crucial." Biden was joined by US Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink, Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs Jake Sullivan, Assistant to the President and Deputy Chief of Staff Jen O'Malley Dillon and Deputy US Ambassador Chris Smith. Zelensky was accompanied by Head of the President's Office Andriy Yermak, Parliament Speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, First Deputy Prime Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko, Deputy Prime Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov, chief foreign policy adviser Andriy Sybiha and chief military adviser Roman Mashovets.
