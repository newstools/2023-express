The decision from the Bank of England to hike interest rates spells good news for Premium Bonds. The prize rate for the savings option is also set to rise - from 3.15 percent to 3.3 percent. Under Premium Bonds, savers do not get a boost in their money via this rate, but it instead goes towards funding the prize pot each month. The latest rise from National Savings and Investments (NS&I) represents the fifth increase in 11 months for savers. While there is set to be the same number of prizes available, the total prize fund will be more as a result of the rate hike. The odds of winning a prize will remain the same, meaning Britons are just as likely to win as in recent draws.

However, if a person does win, it is more likely they will secure a bigger prize as a result - although there will only be two millionaires each month under current rules. NS&I has already shown how this works in practice, sharing the good news via its social media accounts. The Government-backed organisation said over three times more £5,000 to £100,000 prizes have been won since January.
