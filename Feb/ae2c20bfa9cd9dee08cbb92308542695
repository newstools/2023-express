Kansas City Chiefs star Patrick Mahomes and his team-mates were filmed joking around just hours before kick-off at Super Bowl LVII. The Chiefs went into Sunday's showpiece game as underdogs against the Philadelphia Eagles. Despite their status as underdogs, Mahomes and his team-mates seemed relaxed during their pre-game warm-ups. Just hours before kick-off, the newly-crowned NFL Most Valuable Player was filmed playing basketball on the field with his team-mates. Mahomes is known for his laid-back preparation to matches, and never seems to feel the pressure before big games, as proven on Sunday night on the ultimate stage. The Chiefs quarterback does, however, have reason to be confident. He was named NFL MVP earlier this week after a terrific season, and can capture his second Super Bowl ring by beating the Eagles. However, his dream season has been overshadowed in recent weeks by an ankle injury he suffered in the Divisional Round against the Jacksonville Jaguars. Mahomes suffered a high-grade ankle sprain after a late hit while playing a pass, and head coach Andy Reid admitted this week he didn't believe the quarterback would be 100% fit for the game. He said to Express Sport and Mirror NFL this week: “I wouldn’t tell you he’s 100 percent. The training staff works with him endlessly. I guess it’s a tribute to both of them. Pat coming back for more and for those guys cranking on him. Julie [Frymyer] spent most of the time with him, rehabbing him. “We’ve got all the latest and greatest stuff to use technology-wise. He’s used it all and he’s been able to make these jumps here where he can actually function and play in a game, which is pretty remarkable.”
