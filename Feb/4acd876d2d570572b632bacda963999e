The nine-year-old heir to the throne has an estimated £2,451,090,000 (around £2.4billion) in the bank. This huge number is based on his estimated future inheritance as well as the effect he has on the UK economy. But some royal fans might be shocked at which child snuck into the lead in front of the future King. The seven-year-old Princess Charlotte was found to be the richest kid in the world. The only child of William and Kate supposedly has an incredible £3,594,932,000 (around £3.6billion) to her name. Interestingly, this huge figure is down by 12 percent since 2021, but she still remains higher in the wealth ranks than her older brother.

The "Kate effect" refers to the unquestionable influence that the Princess of Wales has over the public - particularly in the fashion stakes. Oftentimes the Princess will wear a dress only for it to be sold out in minutes. Fashion brands will clamour to recreate her style so that non-royals can recreate her look on a budget. Harry and Meghan's three-year-old Archie Mountbatten-Windsor missed out on a top 10 spot, claiming 17th wealthiest child with an impressive £32,681,200 (around £32million). Some other famous names who have made the top 10 list are 16-year-old Suri Cruise, daughter of Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, and Blue Ivy Carter, daughter of Beyoncé and Jay-Z.
