Joan Collins wished her husband a happy Valentine's Day in view of the world, posting a series of affectionate partnership photos on Instagram to punctuate her passion for him. Despite the pair's age gap of more than 32 years, they seem to share a bond that transcends it. In one emotional photo, Joan clutched onto her bare-chested partner and gazed into his eyes affectionately while narrowly avoiding spilling out of her sea-blue bikini top on the beach. The award-winning actress, who met the late Queen on multiple occasions and has even received an OBE from her, has had a truly eventful life, but equally appreciates the calm moments at home with her husband. On today's Instagram post, she couldn't resist telling him so, writing in view of her 305,000 followers: "Wishing my #wonderful #husband a #happy and #joyful #valentinesday #iloveyou." (sic)
