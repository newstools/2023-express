Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have lost American support after their "vile" attack on the Royal Family, a leading commentator has claimed. Angela Levin, who penned biographies on the Duke of Sussex and Queen Consort Camilla, also claimed the Duchess, 41, might not attend King Charles' Coronation.  Speaking to TalkTV's Mike Graham, Ms Levin said: "I think a lot of them don't like it because they care about the family and they think they've been just vile about the family. "And also they've said enough about it. "How many times can you go on and on and on and on, criticising people, and not doing anything else more positive. "I think Harry is very upset, he had no idea that there would be such a strong response from him discussing the way he lost his virginity."

Responding to a recent South Park skit about the couple, he said: "America is falling out of love with them it would seem, Angela." Ms Levin's comments come after Prince Harry and Meghan Markle returned to the frontpages following the release of their Netflix docuseries and the Duke's memoir Spare. Support for Harry and Meghan on the other side of the pond appears to have slumped following the release of Spare last month.  But the couple is not yet confirmed whether they will attend the historic event. Express.co.uk has approached the Duke and Duchess of Sussex for comment.
