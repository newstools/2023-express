Jake Paul is set to feature on the Piers Morgan show on Thursday ahead of his grudge match with rival Tommy Fury this weekend. The two have been in talks to fight for over 18 months, and after two arranged bouts fell through, they finally look set to meet with both men now in Saudi Arabia. Fury first pulled out of a 2021 bout after reportedly struggling with cracked ribs and a chest infection, before not being able to make the second fight the following year after not being able to secure an ESTA to travel to the United States. But after agreeing to fight in Saudi Arabia on Sunday after months of talks, as they both put their undefeated streak on the line for their bout. And Jake Paul has stated that Cristiano Ronaldo is likely to be in attendance for the fight, who lives just 30 miles from where the fight is being held in Diriyah. Paul will hope to avoid Ronaldo's fate in recent months - after the Portuguese superstar watched rival Lionel Messi go on to win the World Cup whilst he had his Manchester United contract torn up after falling out with the club, a dispute played out publicly on Morgan's show. Ronaldo has since lost millions of fans in the process as he moved to Saudi Arabia to join Al Nassr - with it now being tough to argue that he is the greatest of all-time over Messi. Ahead of the fight, Paul sent Fury a brutal message on Wednesday. He said: "Tommy, I hope you have enjoyed these last few moments of your career. "This is it you are going to be retired from. boxing, disowned from your family and go back to your mother's maiden name after this. "Your brother Isn't in the ring with you, your Dad, Molly-Mae or even Bambi. All that little cute motivation about fighting for her, all that s*** goes out of the window."
