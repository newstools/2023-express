On Friday, BMF’s second season returned to Starz with a jaw-dropping scene which saw Charles Flenory (played by Russell Hornsby) have an affair with Mabel Jones (Christine Horn). Fans were angered to see the not-so-loyal father cheat on his wife and threatened to boycott the drama. Throughout season two, Charles and Lucille Flenory’s (Michole Briana White) marriage has been fraught. Riddled with credit card debt and two criminal sons, the couple have not been able to agree on how to move forward. Although their son Meech Flenory (Demetrius Flenory Jr) offered to help with their financial woes, Charles refused to take any drug money, much to Lucille’s devastation. However, even as the patriarch tried to do the right thing, Charles found himself in the arms of his vivacious neighbour, Mabel.

BMF fan @your_dreamking threatened to stop watching as they fumed: “I don’t even wanna watch this new episode of #Bmf I heard Charles f****d that b***h again.” A fed-up @TajaKittyy echoed they were also growing bored of the storyline: “I’m SO tired of seeing Charles f*****g.” Elsewhere, @agift_frmavirgo added: “I’m so sick of Charles's nasty a*s.”     A fourth viewer @BrownieSue99 wrote: “Dutty Charles! He knew why he went over to that b***h house! He knows what he doing!” (sic) And @judithinds fumed: “Nah Charles having an affair now. I hate him!!” While an angered @xNatNatNicholex raged: “Charles is A LIAR AND A CHEATER.” Charles first went over to Mabel’s house to help with repairs but they were soon consumed by sexual tensions after they began dancing to music.

However, his rant was brought to an abrupt end after Mabel dropped her robe and the pair were right back at it again. Viewers are also eager to see Lucille's reaction when she finds out, as Mabel was also giving him flirty glances at church. During the episode, it was obvious Lucille had her suspicions as Charles was being out of character and treating her well.   Despite their recent disagreements, he was more emotionally present and treated her to meals out. During the church service, she noticed Charles dancing and playing the guitar very closely with sister Riley (Jennifer Sears). When Lucille confronted him with cheating allegations, Charles chose his words wisely and demanded he was sleeping with sister Riley.  BMF season 2 continues Fridays on Starz in the US and on Lionsgate+ in the UK.
