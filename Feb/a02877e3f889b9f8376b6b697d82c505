Christian Horner and Toto Wolff’s dramatic head-to-head feud over new rules changes is caught on camera in Netflix’s new Drive to Survive series. The two team principals lock horns around Wolff's calls for the FIA to intervene on porpoising issues at the Canadian Grand Prix. The fight was highly publicised last season as inside sources claimed Wolff “lost his s***” at Horner during the debate. Witnesses stressed the battle was on a “different scale” to previous scuffles leaving fans eagerly waiting over seven months to see the details. But what exactly was discussed over the ruckus in what is Drive to Survive series five’s must-watch moment? Wolff starts things off, by blaming team bosses for not caring about safety after they opposed calls for action. He said: "I hear lots of chit-chat talking about porpoising, the Chinese whispers through the press. Little emails being sent. I can tell you that all of you are playing a dangerous game. If a car ends in the wall because it's too stiff or it's bottoming out you are in the s*** and I am going to come after you all.” However, ex-Ferrari boss Mattia Binotto quickly interrupts, adding: "Toto, Toto."

Horner then intervenes, blaming Wolff for Mercedes' downfall in 2022. He explained: "Hang on. Are we playing to the cameras here, I think this is probably better off camera." Wolff ignores Horner’s suggestion, denying that his frustration was in any way acting. The Austrian commented: "No I don't care. If you think this is a little game or performance I tell you you're very wrong."
