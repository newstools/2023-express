Brooklyn Beckham, 23, has been keeping fans regularly updated with his luxury lifestyle after moving in with his billionaire heiress wife Nicola Peltz, who works as an actress. In his latest post, Brooklyn bathed in freezing waters while wearing just his underwear. "Nice little ice bath," he captioned a photo of himself in which the muscular star was seen clambering out of the water. Brooklyn, the son of fashion entrepreneur and former Spice Girl Victoria, and former Premiership footballer David Beckham, donned nothing more than a pair of black Calvin Klein boxer shorts for the occasion. It seems he's been taking a leaf out of his famous dad's book, as David is also known to be a fan of the bracingly cold ice bath trend.
