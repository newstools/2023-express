A video has caused chaos online after one user shared her discovery of a symbol on her packet of potatoes that she'd never spotted before. After uncovering the symbol's meaning, she took to the social media platform and started a debate about how you're supposed to store the vegetable. In her post to TikTok, @bethking61 revealed how she found instructions to keep her potatoes refrigerated. Zooming in on the corner of her bag of white potatoes, she highlighted a fridge symbol, accompanied by the words: "At home store below 5°C." Firm in the belief the veg should be stored in a cupboard, she was baffled by the discovery. According to the Mirror, so were several other viewers. "Surely no?" the foodie wrote in the video showing off her discovery. She also questioned: "Does anyone else keep their potatoes in the fridge? Is this NEW? Is my whole life a lie..." Her caption added: "Maybe I have been living under a rock but I always thought they belonged in a dark cupboard." Unfortunately, there was no clear cut answer; while some commenters were proud to be team cupboard, others revealed they've been converted to team fridge. One responder claimed: "I've never met anyone that kept their potatoes in the fridge..." while a second said: "Mine go under the sink." Someone else added: "If I don't find it in the fridge I don't put it in the fridge," but another commenter argued "that's why there is a potato drawer next to the salad one." A different commentator said: "I've been keeping mine in the fridge for as long as I can remember. Never have sprouts or spoilage." And an expert revealed: "I've been a chef for 10+ years and always keep spuds in the fridge, even as a wee boyS my mum kept them in the fridge too."
