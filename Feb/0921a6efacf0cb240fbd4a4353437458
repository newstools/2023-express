Shania Twain, 57, looked unrecognisable as she arrived at a pre-Grammy party in Los Angeles last night. The That Don't Impress Me Much singer debuted her new straight platinum blonde locks, ditching her signature brunette tresses. However, the Hollywood star has been met with a mix of responses to her new transformation. She took to Instagram to unveil her new look to her 2 million followers, with her fans sharing their mixed opinions. Shania captioned the post: "I had such a fun night with my @republicrecords family - I haven’t laughed that much in ages! Now it’s time to celebrate with you all!! Queen Of Me is almost out!!" Many social media users rushed to the comments to share their views, with some missing her classic hairdo. Grayheard58 said: "Blonde doesn’t work for you, it's worth a try but it’s too hard on your hair at your age." While @thechristinebuzan said: "I mean, a wise woman once said that the best part about being a woman, is the prerogative to have a little fun!" Fiona McKim, the Beauty Channel Editor at Woman and Home Magazine has claimed Shania Twain's new look is "perfectly on trend, but it may not be a permanent look. It appears that the singer has opted to wear a wig rather than bleaching her hair".
