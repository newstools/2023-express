Susanna Reid, 52, looked fabulous as she stepped out wearing a show-stopping, low-cut sequinned jumpsuit. The TV presenter attended the Broadcast Awards in representation of her ITV programme, Good Morning Britain. Susanna posed up a storm in the long-sleeved black jumpsuit, which she paired with matching stilettos that flaunted her long legs. She styled her chestnut hair in loose waves, while wearing a bold smokey eye in gold and earthy tones. The broadcaster completed the look with a blush lip and a pair of sparking curtain earrings. Susanna’s stellar appearance came just days after she reportedly "confronted" producers over a string of "embarrassing" blunders, inaccuracies and misspellings. She is said to have been keen to ensure there were "high standards" on the show. A source claimed Susanna "made her feelings very clear" and had "confronted production staff". Speaking to The Sun, they said: "Susanna is totally professional and just wants high standards — as Piers [Morgan] or any other presenter would have done. "The last thing anyone wants is her walking away in anger." They added: "She made her feelings very clear, and confronted the senior executives over it.”
