Visiting Tutankhamun’s tomb in Egypt, experiencing the Midnight Sun, and witnessing Iceland’s Geysir are also popular. Martin Lister, head of itinerary planning and destination experience at Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines, which commissioned the research, said: “For many of us, holidays and travelling the world are one of life’s highlights. “There are so many things that we want to see, do, and explore, as shown in the wish lists shared with us, and these play a huge part in us deciding where we go when booking a holiday.” The study also found 65 percent of adults want to see as much of the world as they possibly can – but just 15 percent think they will manage to tick everything off their wish list due to cost, time, or simply the amount they wish to see. Each year, the average adult spends £2,111 on trips – with somewhere off the beaten track the most likely choice for 38 percent, compared to just 17 percent who would choose a popular tourist resort. Good weather is the most important ingredient for a dream holiday for half of those polled, via OnePoll – followed by experiencing the culture, nature, and history of a country (39 percent), and going somewhere you’ve not been before (29 percent). Others look for authentic experiences (19 percent), seeing local wildlife (18 percent), and all-inclusive food and drink (17 percent). As a result, the weather is the biggest factor when deciding where to go for 52 percent, while 42 percent base their decision on the landmarks or sights to see. The travel time (39 percent), food (35 percent), and culture (30 percent) are also important considerations. And almost half (47 percent) dislike going to the same destinations time and time again – because they have so much they want to see. Martin Lister, from Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines, added: “A cruise can be a fantastic way to experience the world – arriving in a new port, spending a day exploring, and waking up somewhere different where new opportunities await.”
