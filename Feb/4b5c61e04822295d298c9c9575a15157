The World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned that the death toll in Turkey could pass 20,000. A senior official from the organisation said fatalities could rise “eightfold” as rescuers continue with their efforts. Catherine Smallwood, WHO’s senior emergency officer for Europe, said deaths often rise in the week after a severe earthquake. Commenting when the estimated death tolls hit 2,600, she said the "potential of further collapses" would put more lives at risk. She added that officials "always see the same thing with earthquakes", with initial reports likely to "increase quite significantly in the week that follows.” Monday's earthquakes in the country and neighbouring Syria razed thousands of buildings to the ground, with some tremors clocking in at 7.8 and 7.5 on the Richter scale. The latest figures have confirmed that more than 4,800 people have died so far, with many more people unaccounted for as temperatures plummeted below zero overnight. Orhan Tatar, an official at the Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) said the newest figures bring the combined death toll in Turkey and Syria to 4,890. Mr Tartar added that the earthquakes injured another 20,426 people and collapsed 5,775 buildings. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
