Shoppers have praised high street giant Marks and Spencer for a "gloriously comfortable" pair of £27.50 trousers. Shoppers have been impressed by just how comfortable the trousers are - while still looking flattering and on-trend. The £27.50 M&S trousers are cut in an on-trend wide-leg shape with a flattering elasticated high waist, reports the Manchester Evening News. For a sleek finish, they have concealed pockets at the side and a crisp crease down the front. M&S' £27.50 Wide Leg Trousers are available in three different colours - black, charcoal and dark navy. The 'super comfortable' £27.50 M&S trousers are also available to buy in five different lengths - Extra Short, Short/Petite, Regular, Long and Extra Long. The trousers are plain in design, but with a flattering and on-trend fit, which can easily be dressed up or down. They can be worn with one of M&S' £17.50 super soft jumpers for work, or styled with a patterned tie-neck blouse for the evening. One five-star reviewer wrote: "Fabulous trousers, well made, great quality and they fit perfectly every time. Sizes are accurate, I have bought a number of pairs now and all have been excellent." Another said: "Wide leg trouser - These are great and super comfortable." A third five-star reviewer raved: "Excellent value super wide leg trousers. Good fit and very comfortable." A fourth said: "Love them, bought them for a 12 hour flight and they were very comfy."   A fifth added: "Very nice trousers, comfortable and stylish. Wide legged but not too wide. They look very chic." "Lovely soft feel and super comfy. Really pleased and have purchased in another colour!" said yet another impressed shopper.
