A Valentine's Day horror discovery has been made by police in Paris who found a woman's decapitated head. Officers also traced down other body parts in the Buttes-Chaumont Park, one of the biggest green spaces situated in the northeast of France's capital. During a police search at 11am, park staff helped cops to track down the head, local media reported. The grisly find was made in an area of woodland in the park, which is a popular location for families and joggers. The woman was dismembered.  On Monday the pelvic area of the woman was found according to sources close to the investigation. The Parisien reported the blood-soaked lower torso, from below the chest to the knees, was found in a bag along with the head today under a pile of foliage at a remote location beside a train line. Buttes-Chaumont Park is located in the 19th Arrondissement of the city and is a popular destination for people looking to exercise and enjoy picnics in amongst the greenery of the park. Le Perisien reported the victim of the gruesome attack had not been identified but said the body had been dressed in "blue jeans" with a "floral decoration at the level of the right thigh". A source told the newspaper: "Obviously, the body was cut dressed. The corpse was not in a state of putrefaction, which seems to attest to a recent death." It's reported the female may be "European or North African" and an autopsy and forensic examiniation is due to be held today (Tuesday), according to the paper. Detectives are believed to be scouring CCTV footage of the park in the hope of finding some evidence of what happened.
