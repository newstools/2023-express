Stacey Solomon welcomed her fifth child - and her third with her husband Joe Swash - earlier this month. The Loose Women star took to Instagram and shared a sweet video with her new arrival before her beau took a swipe at her. Taking to her story, Stacey, 33, could be seen cradling Belle in her arms before making a candid admission. She began: "Happy Tuesday. I thought I would just come and say, 'hi.' "All the kids went back to school today and I didn't realise how loud this house was until they went back to school." The Loose Women panellist continued: "Even Belle was properly wide awake today.

Where has everyone gone?'" Stacey went on: "But me, Belle and Rose got to spend some time together and then Rose had a nap, so I was like, 'Oh my god. This is heaven.'" She then addressed her appearance as the mum-of-five sported a full face of makeup with a bow tied in her hair. "I don't usually look like this," Stacey mused. "It's because I've put some makeup on as it's my dad's birthday." She added: "I've tried to make an effort to go for dinner. By making an effort, I mean I've put some foundation on and a bow in my hair in the hope that no one will notice I still haven't washed it since I've given birth." Joe swiftly interjected: "No, I have definitely noticed." Stacey chuckled: "Shut up! It is very greasy but I don't have the energy to stand there and wash it." DON'T MISS...
