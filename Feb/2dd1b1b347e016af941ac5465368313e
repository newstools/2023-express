The SAG Awards is the last ceremony to take place before the Oscars take place on March 13. And, usually, these are the nominations and awards that more or less predict who will win at the Academy Awards. And things don't look good for Elvis Presley biopic star Austin Butler. He was taken down by the acting giant that is Brendan Fraser for his performance in The Whale. But he wasn't the only big winner of the night. Top Gun: Maverick won some gongs of its own. And Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert's Everything Everywhere All At Once won nearly every award they were up for, including Best Motion Picture Cast and Best Female Actor.
