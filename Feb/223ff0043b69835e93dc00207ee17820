Taxpayers coughed up more than £10million to fund private school fees for the children of British diplomats last year, figures have shown. This included almost £400,000 to send 10 youngsters to Eton, it was revealed.  Diplomats qualify for boarding school subsidies to make sure their children’s education is not disrupted if they are posted abroad at short notice. The Continuity of Education Allowance means senior Foreign Office staff can apply for up to 90 percent of school fees to be paid by the taxpayer if they contribute the remainder. The Foreign Office figures, obtained by the Labour Party, show more than 500 children had their education subsidised at UK schools in 2021-22. James Roberts, managing director of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: “Hard-pressed taxpayers will feel put out by these figures. While it’s understandable that diplomats want the best education for their kids, we don’t need to subsidise sending their children to our most elite public schools.  “Diplomats should expect to send their children to one of our brilliant state schools, like everybody else does, or pay private school fees themselves.” A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: “In order to represent UK interests across the world, our diplomatic staff can be asked to move frequently during their career, sometimes at very short notice. “It is our long-standing policy to support eligible families with education to ensure that children do not suffer disruption during key points in their academic development.”
