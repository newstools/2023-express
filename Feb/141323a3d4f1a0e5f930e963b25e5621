Actor Ruper Everett has cast his doubts on the claims made by Prince Harry of losing his virginity in a field behind a pub. The actor spoke to the Telegraph magazine on the day the Duke’s much-anticipated memoir, 'Spare', was published.  The Duke of Sussex claimed that he lost his virginity in a field behind a pub to an older woman who treated him like "a young stallion." In the book, the 38-year-old revealed the open-air tryst occurred when he was a student at Eton in 2001. The youngest son of King Charles III would have been 17 at the time. "Inglorious episode," wrote Harry, as quoted by Page Six.   He continued: "She liked horses, quite a lot, and treated me not unlike a young stallion. "Quick ride, after which she’d smacked my rump and sent me to grace." However, an actor has something else to say.

And it wasn’t in this country.” Asked if he was suggesting that the Duke had purposefully tried to cover his tracks, to protect the identity of the woman who was really involved in the tryst, the English actor offered little more than a sly grin.

He said: “It’s made me change my view. “I was angry before, and now I just feel very sad – sad for Harry. I felt so sympathetic towards him for years and I still do now. “Honestly! As someone who has put his foot in it quite a bit, I feel particularly bad for him about the Taliban thing. That changed everything and loses him the one group that still loved him.”
