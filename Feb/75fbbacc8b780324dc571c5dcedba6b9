Madonna, 64, proved once again she will not let “ageism” get her down as she took to social media to share a message emblazoned on the back of her jacket. The Material Girl hitmaker wore a satin jacket with the words "Not in the mood" on the back as she spent time with her team during rehearsals for her Celebration tour. The superstar could be seen in a series of pictures facing away from the camera as she spoke to the crew while sitting on the floor. The music superstar wore her long, red tresses in two braids and completed the edgy look with a pair of sky-high black platform boots. The update, shared in view of her 18.8 million Instagram followers, came after the pop star blasted the “ageism and misogyny” she was subjected to after her Grammys appearance earlier this month. She said in a candid social media post: “Once again I am caught in the glare of ageism and misogyny that permeates the world we live in.”
