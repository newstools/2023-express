In a Facebook post, the charity said: “Hi everyone. I’m Toby the Chihuahua and I’m here with my sister, Chloe. “You won’t believe what we’ve been through. We were rescued by the police after we were left to fend for ourselves in the house when my owners went on holiday and didn’t want us back. “We couldn’t believe it…our little legs couldn’t find food or water for ourselves – it was horrible being alone and hungry. “So, We've come to HYPS to find better people who would never dream of abandoning us! We're pretty sure we deserve that, don't you?! “Me and Chloe get on OK, but she gets fed up of me sometimes, so today I've had my little boys op (apparently we can’t risk us having any pesky little babies of our own!) So I'm feeling extra sorry for myself tonight, but I’ll be OK!! “We would really love to find our perfect forever people soon we can be rehomed together or separately (we're happy together or apart).” To find out more about the Toby and Chloe and other hounds, click the link to their page.
