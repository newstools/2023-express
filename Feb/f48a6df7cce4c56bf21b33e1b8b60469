  Shirley Ballas, 62, has been subjected to vile and hateful messages from social media trolls throughout her time on Strictly Come Dancing. However, the star also recently revealed that the online harassment has persisted months after the latest series of the show concluded.     Over the weekend, the star shared a screenshot from one of the trolls, followed by a pointed message about “being kind.” In view of her 275,000 Instagram followers, the star gave some insight into the kind of shocking vitriol she faces on a regular basis. “Ur an actual fat tramp,” the cruel troll’s message began. “Ur the worst judge on Strictly. “U canny dance,” it continued. “Whale on a ballroom floor is what u are.” (sic) READ MORE: Walking Dead star and brother of Hayden Panettiere dies      Shirley captioned the screenshot of the nasty message: “...Still getting abuse after the show @BBCStrictly has finished it never ends.” (sic) Elsewhere on her story, Shirley shared the words: “Nobody ever really knows how much anyone is hurting. “You could be standing next to somebody who is completely broken and you wouldn’t even know it. “That’s why you should always try to be kind,” the message concluded.     Shirley is used to receiving criticism for her Strictly appearances, with some fans taking issue with the way she marks and gives feedback to young women on the show. However, in the past the judge has explained how she will be inundated with insults regardless of who she sends home. Speaking at the Cheltenham Literature Festival in late 2021 as she promoted her book Behind the Sequins, Shirley opened up about her experience with social media trolls. “They say, ‘you’re so fat, you hate younger women’, and if I send a man home, ‘you’re a man hater,” she reflected. “You can’t win.” READ MORE...

The vile message read: “S*******. Could u during your gob******* performance remove your head from your huge fat a******e. “By all means on completing your gob******* replace your head up your a*******. Thanks… “It was a very sad day when u were appointed a judge on Strictly. A very sad day'.” (sic) As well as posting a photo of the crudely-penned letter to Instagram, Shirely also posted a video detailing her thoughts on the subject of hate mail and online trolling.      “As we know I had quite a lot of bullying on Strictly this time and my Inbox on insta was full of horrific and horrendous messages,” she said. “But this has gone a step further now so I've had a hand delivered message which I'm going to share with you. “Hand delivered to the Hippodrome addressed to me with not such nice comments or words or whatever and my message is for the young people, anybody out there who receives awful messages or hate mail or things from people that don't know them. “The issue is the other person's issue - it's not so much ours. Even though I still do find it quite upsetting to have to go and perform and then read something like this from somebody who doesn't even know me. She added at the time: “So the message out there today is be strong going into 2020, really really love yourself and don't be phased by the bullies.”
