Terrifying footage shows an enormous cloud of thick black smoke after a fire at a major oil facility. Three fires broke out on Thursday at different facilities in Mexico and the US, operated by state-owned Mexican oil company Pemex. In a video from Veracruz, Mexico, an enormous pillar of black smoke is seen billowing from the oil storage plant. Other videos showed the smoke plume visible from miles away, with the black mushroom stretching up to the clouds. Five people were unaccounted for after the fire, while three others were taken to hospital, the company said in a statement. Pemex confirmed in a later statement on Thursday evening that a separate fire at its Minatitlan refinery, also in Veracruz, was under control after injuring five people. The blaze had not interrupted the refinery's operations, Pemex said, adding that "it is presumed that the possible cause of the fire was product runoff on a hot surface." A third fire was also reported on Thursday by a community alert at a unit at Pemex's Deer Park, Texas, oil refinery. It has since been given the all-clear. Earlier this week, at least two people also died when two vehicles collided inside a Pemex refinery in the Mexican state of Hidalgo.
