Police have launched a murder probe following the death of a man in a Canvey Island car park overnight. Officers were called to the Iceland car park in Furtherwick Road, Canvey Island, shortly before 1.45am today. On arrival they found a man, in his 40s, injured. Police believe he had been assaulted near to The Haystack pub a short time earlier.  Sadly, despite the best efforts of emergency services, the man died at the scene. Long Road remains cordoned off whilst police investigate. Police anticipate there to be disruption to Canvey Island throughout the day. Detective Chief Inspector Greg Wood, leading the investigation, said: "I want to extend my condolences to the family of the man who has died. "There is a team of officers and staff working hard to establish what happened to him and we are starting to build a picture of the circumstances around the assault. "If you saw what happened, or have any other information about the assault then I need you to contact us." The A130 Long Road is closed in both directions between The Haystack and The Paddocks Community Centre in Canvey Island. Furtherwick Road has also been closed. Earlier today a spokesperson for Essex Police said: "We anticipate there will be disruption to the centre of Canvey throughout today."
