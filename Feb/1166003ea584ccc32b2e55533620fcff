Prince Harry has "no regrets" about any of the intimate and blistering revelations and claims he made in his book Spare, it has been claimed. A fellow guest at Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi’s surprise wedding vow renewal ceremony, which took place in California earlier this month, said the Duke of Sussex seemed quite proud about the success his 416-page memoir is having. The guest told Page Six: "Harry said he was really happy about the success of the book and the reaction to it. He said he had no regrets about any of the revelations, and he’s relieved to have got his story out into the world. There’s been an amazing reaction to it, he said." Harry and Meghan, who attended the star-studded bash together, "seemed to be in extremely good spirits", the source added. However, they continued, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex did not provide an answer when asked whether they will attend the Coronation of King Charles III. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES…
