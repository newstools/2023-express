Jennie Bond, 72, is best known as a BBC News royal reporter, who, over the years, has given the nation the lowdown on everything from the fire at Windsor Castle back in 1992 to Her Majesty's legendary Golden Jubilee celebrations. She even travelled with the Queen, accompanying her on her first ever state visit to Russia, and was by Princess Diana's side when she met Nelson Mandela. The prolific reporter shares her personal life on Twitter, and yesterday uploaded a snap of herself enjoying the sizzling temperatures in Antigua on a winter sun break.  Jennie, who is also known for her appearances on Cash In The Attic and The Great British Menu, looked like she was in her element as she posed delightedly on the sandy beach.
