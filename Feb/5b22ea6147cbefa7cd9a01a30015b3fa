Call The Midwife’s fans are in for a romantic treat as Trixie Franklin marries Matthew Aylward. The couple – played by Helen George and Olly Rix – were covered in confetti by the rest of the cast as they shared a kiss. The scenes were shot in west London despite the long-running BBC One show being set in Poplar, east London. Fans of the programme are wondering if the newlyweds will quit the show after the marriage in the series finale. Despite plot hints, indications are cast favourites will return next series. Olly, 33, said the couple were not the sort to head off: “Their focus is on changing things around them.” Helen said: “I can’t see them moving.” Viewers have to wait to see what happens as the show was delayed a week because of the Bafta Film awards on Sunday. They are also wondering if Sister Monica Joan – played by Judy Parfitt since the launch in 2012 – will pull through after becoming very ill with hepatitis in a recent storyline.
