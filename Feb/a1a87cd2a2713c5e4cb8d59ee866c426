A man who tried to attack two Ministry of Defence police officers with a knife in a failed suicide attempt has been jailed. Prashanth Kandhaiah, 30 of Mellion Close, London, was found guilty of threatening with an offensive weapon and was jailed for 30 months at Southwark Crown Court on Thursday, February 9. The court heard, at about 8.50am on Monday, 18 April, 2022 Kandhaiah, armed with a knife, confronted two Ministry of Defence Police officers in Horse Guards Parade. One of the officers managed to deploy his Taser and other MOD officers managed to restrain and disarm Kandhaiah. Shortly after he was arrested, Kandhaiah asked the officers: “Why didn't you shoot me?" In custody, he then made comments towards officers and said: "I thought if you tried to stab an officer they were meant to shoot you." Metropolitan Police detectives searched his home address and found kitchen knives which were the same make of the knife used to threaten the officers. Kandhaiah's mobile phone was seized and it revealed a map giving directions to the location of the attack. There was also messages from Kandhaiah saying 'Goodbye'. Kandhaiah told detectives in interview that he suffers from mental health problems including schizophrenia. He explained that he had travelled to central London with the knife in order to be shot by police. Detective Constable Tobias Hussey, the investigating officer, said: "This was an incredibly frightening incident for the Ministry of Defence officers involved, who would have believed they were under attack by someone attempting to seriously injure them. "They both showed incredible bravery and restraint to disarm Kandhaiah with the use of Taser. “It is clear this incident could easily have resulted in a different outcome for all parties involved."
