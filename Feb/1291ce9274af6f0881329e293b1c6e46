It's been a long-held dream for Martha to run her own place.“Her dad was a very driven man, he was hardworking.“He was roots and wings for Martha and was always encouraging her to chase her dreams and make them happen.“When he goes, she honours that love by taking that leap of faith and going for it, of course, with Humphrey’s backing.” Sally confirmed in Beyond Paradise, Martha and DI Goodman want to try and spend more time together and slow things down by not working long hours.However, it won’t be plain sailing for Martha in trying to set up her new restaurant as the 42-year-old confessed it’s a struggle to get it off of the ground.She commented: “It’s a bit touch-and-go for a while whether she'll manage it, but an old friend steps in and invests in the restaurant and becomes part of the team.“The café is called the Ten Mile Kitchen because all the ingredients that they use within the kitchen will be sourced within ten miles of Shipton Abbott, including their wine!
