Louise Redknapp, 48, looked fitter than ever as she flaunted her incredible figure in a selection of glamorous outfits for Fault Magazine. The singer flaunted her impressive abs in a sheer black bodysuit with silver spotted detailing, before posing in a racy two-piece, which exposed her black bra. Louise also showed off her gym-honed figure in a skintight velvet catsuit as she shot a sultry pose at the camera. The singer has just released a new version of her Eternal hit Just A Step From Heaven, which features on her Greatest Hits album. The track was originally released by the band back in 1993, and reached number eight on the UK Singles chart. Louise releases a new reimagined version of the Eternal hit 'Just A Step From Heaven' today. It's taken from her upcoming Greatest Hits album.
