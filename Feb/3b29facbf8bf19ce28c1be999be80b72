Police are yet to identify a motive after a 74-year-old woman was murdered in a park on Saturday. Devon and Cornwall Police confirmed the woman's next of kin have been informed but have not identified the victim after the body of a woman was found in Ludwell Valley Park, in the Wonford area of Exeter at about 4pm. A 30-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in police custody. Superintendent Dan Evans said police do not believe the victim and the suspect were known to each other. Holding a press conference on Sunday morning Mr Evans said the attack was "isolated". The suspect was arrested following a police appeal on off-duty police officer outside the Yorkshire Building Society on Exeter High Street. Mr Evans added: "At this time we do not know the motive for the attack but we do not currently believe that the victim and suspect are known to each other. "I would like to reassure people that this is an isolated incident but there be a heightened police presence in the city over the next few days."  Superintendent Evans confirmed their investigation continued but they are "not looking for anyone else in connection with this offence". Speaking to the press he said: "We are still searching the Wonford area as part of our investigation. We believe we may have located the knife believed to have been used in the attack and are retrieving this as we speak." He continued: "Whilst this type of incident is very rare, Wonford is a very close community and I know this death will be felt deeply by all who live in the area. "My thoughts are with the family and loved ones of the victim at this tragic time. We will be supporting them over the coming days and weeks with specially trained officers."
