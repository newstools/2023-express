A British Airways flight flying to Toronto was forced to turn around after one of its passenger experienced a medical emergency. The flight was diverted to Glasgow where it will unload the passenger, according to a flight tracker.     After the passenger has been unloaded the flight will return to Heathrow where it began its journey. Flight BA99 was scheduled to depart from London Heathrow airport at 5.05pm, however, it took off at 6.32 pm. According to the status updated on flightracker.com, the flight is currently delayed by over an hour.  Recently, a Glasgow British Airways flight bound for London was forced to make a dramatic U-turn just minutes from landing.   On February 7, flight 8721 left Glasgow Airport at 7.54am - over an hour after the scheduled 6.30am departure - and was due to land at London City Airport after 9am. Despite the delay setting off, the plane appeared on track as it headed down south and began its approach to the UK capital. But as it drew closer to London City Airport, it was met with Air Traffic Control Restrictions and was abruptly diverted by pilots. The aircraft held for 35 minutes near London but then was forced to return north of the border to Glasgow.
