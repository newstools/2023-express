Prince Harry's "cruelty towards his father knows no bounds" according to a royal biographer. The comments come from royal expert Angela Levin amid the revelation that Meghan and Harry will be invited to the Coronation. However it's still unclear whether the Sussexes will accept the invitation. Meghan Markle wasn't spared from criticism as Ms Levin also savaged the Duchess for being a "royal rebel" who wanted to "mess things up". Ms Levin spoke with Dan Wootton on GB News about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle RSVPing to the invitation to King Charles's Coronation. "There's no such thing as a perfect parent anyway - father or mother - we are all vulnerable humans and Harry is a vulnerable human. He accepts that about himself but not for his father or anybody else who he wants to say rude things about. They've got to do absolutely what he feels is right," Ms Levin said. She added: "He still thinks he's running the whole show. He knows better than anybody else. He says he can fix the Royal Family because it's so outdated. Nobody would like him to come near the Royal Family, frankly. I think his cruelty towards his father knows no bounds." She said if Prince Harry came out with a second book, full of "moaning and secrets", it would be "too shocking for words". She added she "would like" for the Royal Family to tell the Sussexes they couldn't attend the event.  However, Prince Harry wasn't the only Sussex in Ms Levin's crosshairs. The royal biographer also discussed what she believes is Meghan's part in the Sussex saga. Citing an extract from Meghan's blog, The TIG, from her pre-royal days.
