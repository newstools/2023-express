In 2017, the Birmingham-born star lost a whopping two stone when she took part in Sugar Free Farm - a TV experiment where celebrities were challenged to eradicate their sugar consumption, improving their health and diets. The show's nutritionist, Angelique Panagos, revealed that the process entailed "going cold turkey on sugar for two weeks, while living and working together at Laverstoke Park Farm".

She explained: "I don't drink, so I'd never gone through this before but it was literally like coming off alcohol." The TV presenter went on to say that her weight was not down to a lack of exercise as she described herself as "always on the go", taking part in Zumba classes and going for walks. She explained that it was her snacking habits that caused her to gain weight. The star's busy schedule meant she often didn't have time to cook or prepare nutritious food, and instead would reach for a chocolate bar while in a rush. The 48-year-old revealed that she previously enjoyed an average of two chocolate bars per day - 666 in a year.

Overall, Alison dropped an impressive two stone during the show, and said she "feels so much better", and sleeps better too. Alison has previously spoken about her weight with Lorraine Kelly too, on the podcast What If?. She said she wanted to prioritise her health and wellbeing, and does so by following a Weight Watchers programme, but without denying herself too much as "we're all going to die eventually". She said: "My Weight Watchers (WW) journey is focused on getting healthier for myself. I feel rubbish when I don't eat properly or exercise and WW helps me with what I eat and do. "I know I'll also lose weight by following the WW programme, but that's not the be-all and end-all for me. "I want my journey to empower others to think about making changes to their lifestyle to become the best version of themselves. She added: "It's been 17 years since I began working in TV, and I'm busier than ever, especially juggling my duties as a mum. "WW is the only programme that works for me, with the Online WW Coach there for support whenever you need it, 24 hours a day."
