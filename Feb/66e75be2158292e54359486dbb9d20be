The BBC series sees much-loved presenter Stacey Solomon and a team of expert declutterers helping people who are struggling to discard personal belongings in their homes. Wednesday's episode saw a family having a hard time getting their lives in order after suddenly joining households two years ago. The Smiths - Raaj and Roydel, took in their nephew and nieces after their mother died from Covid-19 during the pandemic, and while watching their emotional journey of decluttering the family home, viewers admitted they were "in bits". "There's six of them in there," Stacey explained to her team. "And at the moment, they say it is completely overrun with clutter." One of the Smiths' nieces, Simran, later explained: "The reason why we are all living together is because at the end of 2020, my mum had Covid. "She just got worse and worse - two weeks later, she passed away. "Since then, my auntie and uncle and my younger cousin, Ajay, moved into our home."

"But I instantly felt like I needed to look after these kids and fulfil what my sister wanted for them." Stacey and the team headed to the Hertfordshire home to strip it of its contents, piling them into a warehouse. The Smiths had accumulated more than 207 loose nappies, 24 used toothbrushes, 145 Punjabi suits, and much more. The family confessed they were "shocked" by how much clutter had filled their home. As they took on the task of halving the items, some things were harder to let go of than others. As Raaj began getting rid of her sister's spices, she became emotional and Stacey quickly comforted her. "I think because so much of her personality and her hands have touched this... I just don't want to lose that memory," Raaj explained. DON'T MISS...
