Economists will debate whether the extra spending around that weekend will make up for the lost productivity that comes with the extra bank holiday on May 8. However, in the corridors of Whitehall and Buckingham Palace, the crowning of the King and his Queen Consort is seen as an opportunity to boost the UK’s image around the world. In Whitehall there is a belief that there will be economic spin-offs. This will mainly involve the inevitable boost to tourism and trade resulting from the higher profile the event will give our country internationally. It is curious, then, that Government and Palace officials remain so tight-lipped and sensitive about the projected cost of the whole spectacle. Surely the public has a right to know? Of course, organisers have to balance the benefits to the nation of a celebration bringing us all together with sensitivity towards the cost-of-living crisis. The Government, and ultimately the taxpayer, will be footing most of the bill, which will certainly run into millions of pounds. But in the great scheme of things, it will be a tiny amount compared to, for example, the £15billion the Government wasted on equipment bought but never used during the Covid-19 pandemic. If the Coronation weekend is anything like the solemn, dignified ceremonies after the Queen’s death or the celebrations of her Platinum Jubilee last year, it is likely most Britons will conclude it is money well spent.
