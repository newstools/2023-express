Vladimir Putin's Russia is facing a "critical weakness" in Ukraine as weapons production falls far short of his demands, the UK's Ministry of Defence has said. DefenceHQ's latest bulletin says: "Senior Russian leaders are likely aware that the state’s military industrial output is becoming a critical weakness, exacerbated by the strategic and operational miscalculation of invading Ukraine. Production is almost certainly falling short of the Russian MoD’s demands to resource the Ukraine campaign and restore its longer-term defence requirements." Meanwhile Vladimir Putin’s Russian army is using convicts as “cannon fodder” in a desperate bid to make headway in Ukraine, a new report has claimed. Citing information from the Ukrainian Main Military Intelligence Directorate, the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War’s latest report, published yesterday, said convicts were deployed to Soledar in the Donetsk Oblast in October. The strategy, which essentially apes Wagner’s own approach, is an “indicator that the Kremlin seeks to exploit convicts for future human wave attacks”. Additionally Yevgeny Prigozhin has admitted the Wagner Group, Russia’s mercenary army, which he bankrolls, is struggling in its bid to capture the key eastern city of Bakhmut in the face of fierce Ukrainian resistance. Describing the situation as a “meat grinder”, he admitted it would “not be taken tomorrow because there is heavy resistance and grinding". He added: "We will not be celebrating in the near future."
