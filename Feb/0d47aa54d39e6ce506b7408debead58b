Country walks in her stylish new weatherproof jacket were not to be for a customer who when it did not turn up struggled to get a response from the retailer. Early last month Gill Wilson paid £159 to the House of Fraser, one of Frasers Group’s brands, for her waxed and quilted Barbour, plus £9.99 for next-day delivery.  “I began to worry when I didn’t receive a slot time and then I realised I had not received a purchase confirmation email either,” she told Crusader. ++ If you've been affected by this issue or feel you've been a victim of injustice, please contact consumer champion Maisha Frost on maisha.frost@express.co.uk ++; “I tried all the phone numbers they give, but they were not available and I also emailed. “The only reply I got was to say they had no record of my order. Yet my bank account shows payment was taken the day I ordered. “This should have been straightforward, not complicated as it is now. I look after my husband who is a stroke patient and I could really do without this extra hassle.”  Gill had supplied evidence of the debit and did so again when asked. Keeping all the proof also stood her in good stead when she was sent a photo of her parcel on a doorstep, allegedly showing that it had been delivered to her. The image depicted a manky front door and a grubby plastic package, all a far cry from Gill’s well-tended entrance. “I set them straight that it certainly wasn’t our house, but fighting this is getting tiring,” she reflected. Of course, she could have opted for a chargeback through her bank, but carers such as Gill are always under pressure and chronically short of time, so to make it easier Crusader took over fighting her corner. Once alerted Frasers Group responded promptly and has now confirmed the refund has been paid. Gill commented: “It wasn’t so much the money but the principle, we’re so pleased thank you Crusader.” [Gill's name has been changed]
