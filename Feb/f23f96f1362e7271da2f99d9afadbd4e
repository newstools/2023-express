If you fancy a new flagship Android phone then it might be worth checking out Amazon's online store. The retailer is dishing out discounts on a number of flagship devices including the very latest Samsung Galaxy S23 and S23 Ultra. These smartphones, which were only announced last week, come packed with upgrades including an exclusive Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor, a new design, bigger batteries and an improved camera. In fact, the more expensive S23 Ultra now features a 200-megapixel rear snapper that shoots impressive images at night thanks to its Astrophotography settings. There's also much better image stabilisation which makes shooting 8K home movies appear silky smooth and shake-free. The Ultra also gets a huge 6.8-inch 120Hz screen, a massive 5,000mAh battery  and an S Pen stylus tucked inside its eco-friendly shell which is now partly made from recycled fishing nets. Those buying these phones from Amazon's website will find discounts that include £50 off the 256GB version of the Galaxy S23 or £150 off the 512GB S23 Ultra. YOU CAN FIND THE AMAZON GALAXY DEALS HERE Although these Amazon offers sound impressive, they are actually identical to Samsung's own website with the Korean firm currently giving customers the chance to get double the usual storage for free. That means you get the 256GB S23 for £849 (saving £50), the S23+ for £1,049 (saving £100) and the 512GB S23 Ultra for £1,249 (saving £150). And that's not all as Samsung is also dishing out 6 months of Disney+ for free plus there's up to £600 off the price of the device if you hand over your old phone. Amazon is also offering trade-in deals but they aren't as generous as Samsung's discounts. Both retailers include ways to pay via interest-free instalments but Samsung has the option to pay things back over 36 months whilst Amazon only offers a shorter 12-month period. All that means you might be heading straight to Samsung rather than buying these phones via Amazon's store. Here are all the deals available right now from Samsung.
