Russia is “eradicating” towns and villages in eastern Ukraine, a local governor has said, and “throwing” new units towards the frontlines ahead of the next stage of fighting. As the winter draws to a close and the anniversary of Putin’s brutal invasion nears, it is widely believed that Russia is preparing to stage a major spring offensive.  Reports suggest Putin has mobilised as many as 500,000 new recruits, as well as specialist forces such as the VDV, transferring to Donbas, which comprises the two easterly Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.
