A "true canine hero" that found weapons and thousands of pounds worth of drugs and cash as a police dog is among those shortlisted for a prestigious award. Staffordshire Bull Terrier Stella is among five inspiring finalists that have been unveiled as nominees for the Kennel Club Hero Dog Award. Others up for the gong include a spaniel who has spent hundreds of nights camping out with his teenage owner to raise money for rescue dogs and an organisation helping Ukrainian pups and owners. And a special assistance dog who has helped his young owner overcome chronic, debilitating pain One of the five inspiring finalists will be crowned with the Kennel Club Hero Dog Award at Crufts 2023 in Birmingham next month. The award this year also honours dogs involved with the search and rescue mission in Turkey and Syria after the devastating earthquakes this month. These heroic teams will be specially recognised at Crufts for their bravery and dedication. Sky News presenter Kay Burley, the ambassador for his year's award, said: “These five special dogs are not only heroes to their owners but also to the rest of us. “They make a huge difference every day by providing love, companionship and dedication, and protecting the nation and saving lives. “No one can deny the remarkable impact dogs have, from the joy they bring each day, to being by our side during the hardest times and showing extraordinary loyalty and bravery.” The winner, set to be crowned by Kay on March 12, will receive £5,000 from The Kennel Club Charitable Trust for the dog charity of their choice. The other finalists will receive a £1,000 donation to their chosen canine charity. Kay said: “The Kennel Club Hero Dog Award is a celebration of this unique bond we share with dogs and their heroic feats – please vote for your four-legged hero and celebrate these five inspirational dogs.”
