An apartment in the Morningside Heights region of Manhattan, a highly sought-after location, has been advertised online for a very low price. The average rent for a studio in the area, known for being the home of Ivy League Columbia University, is $3,525 a month. This flat is better value, at a meager $630 monthly, more than 80 percent cheaper than a studio there. For this small sum, renters can live in an area that has been home to notable people like the writers F. Scott Fitzgerald and Jack Kerouac, and the singer Fiona Apple. However, there's a catch. The Spare Room user has very specific requirements for his new roommate. He wrote: "I'm ONLY looking for another platonic social nudist to share my two-bedroom apartment." He went on: "I'm looking for another creative, socially conscious male nudist who is keen on saving money and community-building while focusing more time and energy on enjoying life. "Please do not respond if you do not know what social nudism is, accept that I am only looking for a male roommate who lives the lifestyle, especially if you have never lived and been socialized with others. Please do not contact me if you're undecided about the nudism/naturist lifestyle." The poster was clear that he wasn't looking for a partner, but for a platonic roommate. He said: "I'm accustomed to sharing an apartment and rooms with other social nudists.

Social nudism is the practice of enjoying everyday life without clothing. It can span from taking the occasional nudist holiday or attending infrequent nudist events to living your everyday life nude wherever possible. Those who practice nudism claim it is not generally exhibitionist or voyeuristic, or sexual in nature.

The poster wrote: "I've got no racial, ethnic, cultural, or religious hang-ups. None will be allowed or tolerated as a potential roommate. No microaggressions.

"Potential nudist roommate MUST be fully-vaccinated and have booster shot with immunization card as proof. No exceptions."

If all goes well, the initial agreement can be extended in three-month terms, and so on." He asks that those interested send their "complete info and brief personal background" in their first email.
