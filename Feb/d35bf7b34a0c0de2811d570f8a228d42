Emma Raducanu may have to rely on a wildcard to play at Wimbledon this year if she continues to tumble down the world rankings. The Brit missed out on the chance to build momentum at the ATX Austin Open this coming week after withdrawing with a bout of tonsilitis. Raducanu was poised to take to the court in Austin for her first competitive action since crashing out of the Australian Open more than a month ago. The 20-year-old made it to the second round in Melbourne before suffering a straight-sets defeat to Coco Gauff. She had already arrived at the Westwood Country Club in Texas to begin her preparations, but illness forced Raducanu to withdraw on Saturday night. The development comes as a major blow to tournament organisers, who had marketed the former US Open champion as one of the star attractions. "I’m sorry to have to withdraw from the ATX Open," Raducanu explained in a brief statement. "I am currently suffering from tonsillitis and am unable to compete this week. Thank you to the tournament for the great hospitality here in Austin."

If the Brit had withdrawn before Friday's qualifying draw, compatriot Katie Boulter would have advanced straight through to the main draw without the need for a qualifying win over Hailey Baptiste. Injury and illness issues have been regular sources of frustration for Raducanu during her career to date and they have not helped in her pursuit to stay afloat in the world rankings. With two wins from four matches so far this season, Raducanu is currently ranked No 81 in the world. Dropping outside the world's top 100 could have severe consequences regarding her home tournament, Wimbledon, as she may require a wild card to enter. Although it is likely that the All England Club would grant one, given Raducanu's gripping journey to the round of 16 in 2021 and prominent national status, nothing is guaranteed. The 20-year-old is now under pressure to start picking up wins on tour or risk dropping below the magic rankings mark by the end of April.  Raducanu is set to remain in the United States and prepare for Indian Wells, which gets underway early next month. She gained entry to the tournament by virtue of a wild card after missing the rankings cut. A solid performance in California would boost Raducanu's bid to stay in the world's top 100, although she was knocked out in the second round of last year's tournament after losing to Petra Martic.
