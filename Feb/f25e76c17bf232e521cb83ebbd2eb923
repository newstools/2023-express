The Chinese zodiac is represented by 12 animals, all with different personality traits. According to Chinese astrology, what can you do to lead a happy life? Rat (1948, 1960, 1972, 1984, 1996, 2008, 2020) The Rat represents "wisdom" in the Chinese zodiac, so often finds the most happiness in success and knowledge. This social butterfly sign also finds happiness in helping others with their problems, so they should build a strong social circle. Ox (1949, 1961, 1973, 1985, 1997, 2009, 2021) Ox finds joy in "stability" and hopes to achieve financial and familial success. Shyer than Rat, Ox likes to keep the company of a small group of friends, and can derive happiness from their closeness.

But for inner happiness, Tiger must focus on an intense goal, perhaps "fighting for a cause they deem righteous". Rabbit (1951, 1963, 1975, 1987, 1999, 2011, 2023) Unlike Tiger, Rabbit is not the first to get involved in a big confrontation about what is right and wrong. Instead, their happiness is found through having a "peaceful life surrounded by loyal people". Rabbit also needs their "alone time", and can find joy in solo artistic pursuits. Dragon (1952, 1964, 1976, 1988, 2000, 2012, 2024) The "powerful" Dragon can often intimidate others and instil fear, so the key to their happiness is to find a circle of people whose ideas they also trust. That being said, they also love being in positions of power, so as long as they make sure they listen to others, Dragon can be truly joyful in the top spot at a company. Snake (1953, 1965, 1977, 1989, 2001, 2013, 2025) Snake is "notoriously mysterious", so it's important they have a close-knit group of friends who they can open up to. "When a snake enjoys the company of others they can let their true colours shine through."

Learning "diplomacy" is key if they want a shot at a peaceful life and strong "interpersonal relationships". Goat (1955, 1967, 1979, 1991, 2003, 2015, 2027) Goat's personality can be described as "serene and peaceful", so a happy life for them is drama free. This sign also enjoys routine and organisation, but would benefit from a few relationships which allow them to let loose a little. Monkey (1956, 1968, 1980, 1992, 2004, 2016, 2028) Ever the "problem solver", Monkey can feel absolutely delighted sitting down to a puzzle. Like Tiger, Monkey enjoys taking centre stage in their relationships and career, so would do well to cultivate situations that allow them to do this. Rooster (1957, 1969, 1981, 1993, 2005, 2017, 2029) Rooster's happiness lies in a crowded room full of people, socialising and mingling all through the night. This "confident" sign also likes to speak their mind so could do with some friends who listen keenly to their ideas. Dog (1958, 1970, 1982, 1994, 2006, 2018, 2030) Dog is empathetic and compassionate, instinctively putting the needs of others before their own. However, it's important for Dog to take some time for themselves, even if this does not come naturally to them. Pig (1959, 1971, 1983, 1995, 2007, 2019, 2031) Pig believes in the "basic goodness of mankind" and is happy when allowed to live freely. This sign is full of "wonder" about the world we live in but could be happier if they slowed down and appreciated things more, according to The Power of Happy.
