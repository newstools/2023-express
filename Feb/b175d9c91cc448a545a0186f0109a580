The music legend and the 36-year-old looked smitten as they walked hand-in-hand. The couple were seen arriving at Matsuhisa restaurant last night, ahead of the Grammy Awards tomorrow. Wearing her blonde tresses down, the 76-year-old teamed a white jacket with loose grey trousers. The couple first met at Paris Fashion Week in September, and were said to be dating two months later. Cher poked fun at their 40-year age gap while appearing on The Kelly Clarkson Show in December. She commented: "Well, on paper it's kind of ridiculous but in real life we get along great. He's fabulous and I don't give men qualities that they don't deserve."
