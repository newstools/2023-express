The news was announced by Nintendo on Twitter: "Tune in at 22:00 GMT tomorrow, 08/02, for a Nintendo Direct livestream featuring roughly 40 minutes of information mostly focused on Nintendo Switch games launching in the first half of 2023." While Nintendo remains tight-lipped about the line-up for the Direct, that hasn't stopped fans from speculating. Based on recent leaks, it looks like Metroid Prime 4 will almost certainly make an appearance during the Direct. According to Nintendo insider Fun_Way_6592 - who previously leaked Skyward Sword, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, WarioWare: Get it Together, and Splatoon 3 - Metroid news is inbound. In addition to Metroid Prime 4, there are rumours that remastered versions of the first three Metroid Prime games are coming to Switch. Outside of Metroid, there's a strong chance Nintendo will unveil the next wave of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe courses. That's on top of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 DLC. Elsewhere, according to a post on Famiboards, Nintendo recently assigned new ID numbers to The Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom and Advance Wars 1+2. This suggests both games will make an appearance during today's Nintendo Direct conference. Advance Wars 1+2 was originally scheduled to launch in 2022. However, the game was delayed due to the war in Ukraine. Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom, on the other hand, has a May 12 launch date for the Nintendo Switch. Express Online will keep this post updated with all the latest announcements from the Direct presentation on February 8.
