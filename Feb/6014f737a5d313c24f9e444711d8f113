F1 roars into life tomorrow with pre-season testing set to get underway in Bahrain just a week before the new campaign. Teams get just three days to perfect their packages before the lights go out for the first Grand Prix. Max Verstappen will be hoping to defend his world title after dominating 2022 with Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton eyeing their chance to dethrone the Dutchman. Despite the short amount of time to the first race, there are fears Ferrari's SF-23 could be illegal. According to reports, teams are looking at whether their radical S-duct meets the regulations. Their idea is thought to allow for better airflow to the rear wing but rivals could lodge protests. Meanwhile, Sky Sports host Ted Kravitz believes Mercedes could radically change Lewis Hamiltonâ€™s car. The Silver Arrows retained their dramatic side pod-less model on their W14 but the host feels they could have a plan B if the car is uncompetitive.
