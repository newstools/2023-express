If you have an older set-box tucked under your TV then now is a very good time to check the make and model as you could be eligible for a free upgrade to something new. The big switchover is due to the BBC scraping some of its Standard Definition (SD) content which means those with ageing Sky+ devices will no longer be able to watch shows such as the regional news. Almost all BBC news services will be moved to High Definition (HS) throughout this month so it's vital that customers act now to keep up to date. Those who don't opt for the free upgrade will soon see a message on the screen that reads, "The BBC is making all its services available in HD. To watch local BBC One programmes, you need to upgrade to HD. If you are a Sky TV customer, you should visit www.sky.com/help/bbcupgrade." Here is when all of the channels in your area are being switched over to the new format.

If you want to make sure you are prepared for the changes before they happen you can see if your Sky box is affected by simply selecting channel 105 on your remote. See Channel 5 HD? Luckily you're not affected and can carry on using your box. Sadly, if you're seeing Channel 5 in SD, you'll need to upgrade your Sky box. The affected boxes are:Digibox: 4F01 to 4F06 (Amstrad) • 4E01 to 4E05 (Grundig) • 9F01 to 9F08 and 9F0A (Pace) • 0F01 to 0F05 (Panasonic) • 4E06 to 4E08 (Thomson)Sky+: 4F2001 to 4F2006 (Amstrad) • 4F2101 to 4F2118 and 9F2101 to 9F2137 (Amstrad or Pace) • 9F2001 to 9F2024, PVR2, 9F2201 to 9F2235, 9F2301 to 9F2339 (Pace) • 4E2101 to 4E2141 (Thomson) Although it's clearly a pain switching devices, Sky is softening the blow thanks to customers getting a modern Sky Q box for free.
