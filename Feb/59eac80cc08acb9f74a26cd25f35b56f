The Europa League play-off winners were confirmed last night with the Manchester United pulling off an impressive comeback victory over Barcelona and now head into today's last-16 draw as one of the tournament favourites. The draw is split into two categories with the eight group-stage winners, as well as Real Sociedad, being seeded while the play-off winners are unseeded. UEFA rules also prevent two teams from the same territory being drawn to face each other in the next week, meaning an all-Premier League clash between Arsenal and United isn't on the cards. But there are still several top teams left in the draw for both Arsenal and United to avoid with the likes of Juventus, Bayer Leverkusen and Sevilla all possibilities for Mikel Arteta's side. United arguably have a more favourable pool of possible opponents, although they could face Real Sociedad. The Spanish side are the last team to have beaten United at Old Trafford this season, back at the start of the Europa League group stages. Arsenal also enjoyed a near-perfect group stage as they won five of their six matches. Express Sport provides live coverage of the draw as it gets underway at 11am.
