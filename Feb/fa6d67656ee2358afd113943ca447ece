Maura Higgins had been living it up at Verde Beach Dubai, which has been billed as a veritable "playground for the international jet set" and directly faces the iconic sail-shaped Burj Al Arab hotel. The single star posted from the emirate to wish herself a Happy Valentine's Day, quipping: "I can buy myself flowers!", before heading back to the UK for the Creed III event. Her sexy outfit caused a stir as it scarcely concealed her pert derriere. The former Love Island sex symbol looked scarcely recognisable as she slipped on a short jet-black wig with a dramatic fringe especially for the occasion. She rocked up to London's Cineworld Leicester Square with a host of other celebrities, including actor Michael B Jordan, who both directed and starred in the film. Maura's red carpet look, in a tight black floor length bandage dress with cut-outs at the waist, commanded plenty of attention as she enjoyed the party.
