With Fawlty Towers set to return to our television screens 48 years after it first aired on the BBC, many people are concerned the show's humour will not sit well with today's audiences. The wildly popular BBC series was written by Monty Python alumni John Cleese and his wife Connie Booth and ran for two Bafta-winning series in 1975 and 1979.   It follows the exploits of Basil Fawlty and his wife Sybil as they try to run a hotel. Birmingham Live reporter Milly Vincent, a self-confessed millennial, decided to see how the humour stood up today by watching Series 1 Episode 6 "The Germans".    Cleese previously spoke out about the character Major's controversial racist rant in 2020. He told The Age: "The major was an old fossil left over from decades before. "We were not supporting his views, we were making fun of them." It appears Milly is not the only one to feel this way. Twitter user Georgie Heath wrote: "Really sceptical over Fawlty Towers revamp. Humour has moved on, the world has moved on and it was iconic at its time." Other Twitter users suggested that the show will latch on to modern-day tropes as material. They wrote: "You can probably put good money on Basil's daughter being vegan in the new Fawlty Towers." Another Twitter user wrote: "A follow up to Fawlty Towers, in this day and age? Calling it now, it'll be utter dog sh**." Whilst one commented: "Is anyone else concerned that this is going to be utter sh*** that sullies the legacy of an amazing sitcom?" An official release date for the Fawlty Towers reboot is yet to be announced. On Tuesday, February 7, the US production company Castle Rock Entertainment shared the news they would be rebooting the show, Deadline reports.
