Jake Paul has agreed terms to face another one of his long-term rivals in British YouTuber KSI in a winner-takes-all fight. Paul and KSI have been linked with one another for nearly five years now, after the Jake's brother, Logan, previously fought KSI in 2018 and once again in 2019. The Briton would get the better of the older Paul, winning the second bout after a draw in the first. Logan and KSI have since become friends and even started a business together with PRIME energy drink, which has partnered with Arsenal FC and the UFC. But there's still no love lost between Jake and KSI, with the influencers turned boxers calling each other out on numerous occasions. A fight has never materialised though, with KSI taking three years away from the sport before returning in 2022. As well as that, the two reportedly could not a agree on a fight weight, but that has now been resolved, with the winner of the fight taking the whole purse and the loser taking home nothing. Paul tweeted: "I will agree to fight KSI at 180 pounds plus his request for a 10 pound rehydration clause. BUT it has to be 100% winner takes all like he requested. ZERO to the loser. ZERO." KSI has recently hinted that a fight could be held at Wembley Stadium, after he defeated Brazilian influencer and gamer FaZe Temperrr with a first-round knockout. The British star is reportedly looking to face former David Haye opponent Joe Fournier, but no date or confirmation of that fight is yet set. For Paul, all of his concentration will be on Tommy Fury, who he is set to face later this month after 18 months of going back and forth. The two have had two previous fight dates set, with Fury pulling out after suffering injuries the first time around, before failing to secure an ESTA to travel to the United States. Both men come into the fight undefeated, with Paul facing the first opponent with a boxing background in his career, previously defeating MMA stars Anderson Silva, Tyron Woodley and Ben Askren.
