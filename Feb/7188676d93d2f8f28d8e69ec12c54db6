Four years ago (2019) We revealed how Shamima Begum, 19, who fled to Syria aged 15 and married an Islamic State fighter, had been stripped of her British citizenship. She had begged the authorities to be allowed back with her new baby but Home Secretary Sajid Javid said she would never be allowed to return. Begum’s lawyers have argued she should be treated as a victim of trafficking.  85 years ago (1938) Anthony Eden resigned as Foreign Secretary in protest at Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain’s appeasement of Fascist Italy, which he concluded posed a threat to Britain. He later opposed the Munich Agreement, championed by Chamberlain, which allowed Hitler to annex the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia. 37 years ago (1986) The Russians launched the Mir space station, opening up a new era of Soviet space exploration. It came just three weeks after the US Space Shuttle Challenger disaster in which seven astronauts died. The first of Mir’s crew arrived three weeks later and it remained occupied until November 2000.
