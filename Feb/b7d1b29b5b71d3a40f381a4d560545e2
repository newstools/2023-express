Maya Jama, 28, bared her waist and taut stomach as she returned to her Love Island presenting role in time for the fearfully awaited Casa Amor recoupling episode. Contestants wait with baited breath to find out who faces being evicted from paradise, after it was reported that nine of them will get the boot. Choices must be made about whether the hopefuls want to remain in their original couplings or find a new partner - and the shake-up is bound to see emotions running high. To match the drama of the occasion, Maya donned her epic red satin dress, which featured cut-out sections at the middle, and a saucy split revealing one of her thighs. She paired the long gown with a pair of dark red strappy heels, prompting fans to joke: "Maya Jama has no business looking this good!"
