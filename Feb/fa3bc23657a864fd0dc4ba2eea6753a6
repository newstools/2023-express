Gemma Arterton made a spectacular entrance at the premiere of Funny Woman, which was screened at the Electric Cinema in London. The 37-year-old gave birth to her son, who she shares with Peaky Blinders actor Rory Keenan, during the Christmas season, and she has spoken of her adoration for her "little elf". However, she made a major comeback when she waltzed in wearing an all-black outfit consisting of a dramatically plunging button up blazer dress, a pair of black tights and some patent skyscraper heels. She stars in six-part TV series Funny Woman as Barbara Parker, a Miss Blackpool beauty queen turned comedian during the Swinging Sixties - and so far, it's had some rave reviews. Back in 2008, Gemma previously wowed as secret agent Strawberry Fields in the James Bond movie Quantum of Solace.
