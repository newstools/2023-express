Rita Ora, 32, looked radiant as she arrived at Jazz Lincoln Centre in NYC last night to perform at the American Heart Association's Go Red For Women Red Dress Collection concert. Hot Right Now hitmaker Rita, who is newly-married to Hollywood director Taika Waititi, 47, turned heads as she stepped out in see-through lace trousers, exposing her black underwear. The Masked Singer panellist couldn't resist showing off her dazzling diamond ring, while waving at fans, which is rumoured to be her wedding band. Rita paired her daring trousers with a tiny black crop top, unveiling her gym-honed abs. The British singer accessorised with a diamond necklace and a black satin jacket before taking to the stage in not one, but two red dresses. Rita went on theme for the rest of the night, as she helped raise awareness of the impact of heart disease on women in America.
