Haider Siddique has admitted to the sexual assault of a vulnerable 13-year-old girl he met online. The former PC was arrested after a bus driver noticed him acting inappropriately towards the victim. Siddique admitted two counts of sexual activity with a child at Birmingham Crown Court. The 22-year-old joined West Midlands Police in August 2021 but had been off sick since November that year and was never deployed to an operational role. On the day of the incident, a bus driver noticed Siddiques behaviour and alerted the police. The incident occurred whilst Siddique was on long-term sick leave. Judge Tom Rochford told the defendant said the harm caused was "in the most serious category" before adjourning sentencing. Deputy Chief Constable Vanessa Jardine branded Siddique a "sickening criminal act". Constable Jardine continued: "We did not hesitate to arrest Siddique and have carried out a robust and meticulous investigation to establish the full extent of his abuse. “We are committed to rooting out any member of staff who engages in criminality whenever we find evidence of it.

West Midlands Police confirmed that the force will convene a "former officer" misconduct hearing following the conclusion of criminal proceedings.
