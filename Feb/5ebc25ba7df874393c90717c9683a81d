Manchester United head coach Erik ten Hag may be feeling justified in taking a hardline approach towards player behaviour after a video emerged of one of his former stars unleashing a furious rant. The Dutchman seems to have a knack for rooting out negative influences in the dressing room, and his decision to sell Noa Lang proves he might just have been right to offload the forward. The 23-year-old, now playing for Club Brugge, reacted angrily to his team's failure to win their local derby with rivals Cercle Brugge after twice throwing away the lead in a 2-2 draw. Lang had given his side the lead on 18 minutes but Cercle Brugge fought back valiantly to earn a point. In a short video clip uploaded to social media, a player identified as Lang can be seen storming through the tunnel past a club official after the full-time whistle, seemingly furious with their inability to win. On his way to the dressing room, Lang can he heard dishing out a verbal tirade towards his team-mates, accusing them of being "f*****g p*****s" and bemoaning their tendency to drop points "every f*****g week".

The footage soon went viral on Twitter as fans tore into Lang's behaviour, with Ten Hag perhaps able to rest a little easier knowing he made the right call to move the winger on when he was at Ajax. The six-cap Netherlands international was one in a long line of players to come through the academy system at Ajax during Ten Hag's five-year spell with the Eredivisie giants, and it appeared they had unearthed another gem when he bagged a hat-trick on his debut back in 2019. However, those goals were to be the only times Lang scored for Ajax as he then headed out on loan to Twente and then Brugge.

The moment I indicated that a transfer would be better, I was no longer in the trainer’s plans. “I wanted to be loaned, but he was so angry that he wanted to sell me. Not the management, but the trainer got his way. I never spoke to him again and I don’t want to." Two years down the line, Ten Hag is thriving at Old Trafford and leading his side to a potential Premier League title challenge, while Lang's club might fail to make it into Europe altogether. And that could give the United boss some vindication in how he turned his back on the forward following his latest outburst.
