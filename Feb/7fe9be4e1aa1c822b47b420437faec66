Zara McDermott, 26, appeared to suffer a wardrobe mishap as she became one of the first stars to walk the red carpet at the Brit Awards 2023. The former Love Island star turned heads in a show-stopping nude sequinned gown that was see-through and highlighted her figure. The stunning, floor-length dress featured a key-hole cleavage and split-cuff sleeves. Zara gave the cameras a fierce look as she posed up a storm, showing off her long, blonde tresses, which were styled in classic waves. The TV personality finished off the polished look with a pair of dainty silver earrings and a light smokey eye in earthy tones.
