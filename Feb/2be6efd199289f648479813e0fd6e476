TikTok poses privacy concerns for its users as it collects "very sensitive personal information", an expert has said. Caitlin Chin, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies said TikTok is one of many "underregulated" apps in the mobile app industry. However, she has argued a lot of fears surrounding the app are based on projections about what China could do with the data rather than specific evidence of wrongdoing. It comes as TikTok faces allegations that it harvests a huge amount of user data to hand it over to the Chinese Government. The US yesterday bumped up its concerns over the app, giving its federal agencies 30 days to delete TikTok from government mobile devices, citing the need to "curb foreign adversaries" from accessing US data. And last week, Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee Alicia Kearns warned TikTok's mass data collection was a more "meaningful" threat than Chinese spy planes. She said it could be used as part of Chinese espionage. But according to Ms Chin, "we have not actually seen examples of the CCP using Tiktok for these purposes". She told the BBC: "We know that TikTok collects a lot of very sensitive personal information from Americans. We know that the Chinese government is interested in surveillance and propping it more broadly but we have just not seen specific examples of Tiktok being used as a propaganda vessel or a direct surveillance vessel so far." In response to the US ban of the app, TikTok told ABC News: "The ban of TikTok on federal devices was passed in December without any deliberation, and unfortunately that approach has served as a blueprint for other world governments. These bans are little more than political theatre." The type of data TikTok collects includes geolocation, your mobile phone contacts, biometrics, facial and voice data, explained Ms Chin. She added that TikTok is also able to reveal who someone is, where they go on a daily basis, who they are in contact with, their interests and what they search for online. Ms Chin said: "So TikTok poses privacy concerns for sure but it is not the only mobile app and banning TikTok would not solve the larger privacy problems within the US infrastructure."
