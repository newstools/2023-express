Billionaire Elon Musk hinted on Wednesday that he will be stepping down as Twitter CEO by the end of 2023. Speaking via a video call to the World Government Summit in Dubai, Musk said he could be looking for a successor by the end of the year, following his controversial takeover of the social media platform.   “I think I need to stabilize the organization and just make sure it’s in a financial healthy place,” Musk said when asked about when he'd name a CEO. “I’m guessing probably toward the end of this year would be good timing to find someone else to run the company.” Musk made his wealth at PayPal, then founded SpaceX and invested in the electric car company Tesla. His recent $44 billion purchase of Twitter was met with mixed reaction, with some believing it would be good for free speech on the platform.    Musk offered a wide-ranging 35-minute discussion which touched on the billionaire’s fears about artificial intelligence, the collapse of civilization and the possibility of space aliens. But questions about Twitter kept coming back up as Musk described both Tesla and SpaceX as able to function without his direct, day-to-day involvement. “Twitter is still somewhat a startup in reverse,” he said. “There’s work required here to get Twitter to sort of a stable position and to really build the engine of software engineering." The billionaire also said Twitter was "imposing a niche" view on users before he took over the flagging site.  “I think that the general idea is just to reflect the values of the people as opposed to imposing the values of essentially San Francisco and Berkeley, which are so somewhat of a niche ideology as compared to the rest of the world," he said. "And, you know, Twitter was, I think, doing a little too much to impose a niche.” Musk's takeover at Twitter has seen mass firings and other cost-cutting measures. Musk, who is on the hook for about $1 billion in yearly interest payments for his purchase, has been trying to find way to maximize profits at the company.    He said: “Twitter is certainly quite the rollercoaster." Forbes estimates Musk's wealth at just under $200 billion. The Forbes analysis ranks Musk as the second-wealthiest person on Earth, just behind French luxury brand magnate Bernard Arnault. But Musk has also become a thought leader for some as well, albeit an oracle that is trying to get six hours of sleep a night despite the challenges at Twitter.  Musk described his children as being “programmed by Reddit and YouTube”. He warned that artificial intelligence should be regulated “very carefully”, describing it as akin to the promise of nuclear power but the danger of atomic bombs. He also cautioned against having a single civilization or “too much cooperation” on Earth, saying it could “collapse” a society that's like a “tiny candle in a vast darkness”. And asked about the existence of aliens, Musk had a firm response. “The crazy thing is, I’ve seen no evidence of alien technology or alien life whatsoever. And I think I’d know because of SpaceX,” he said. “I don't think anybody knows more about space, you know, than me.”
