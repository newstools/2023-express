Police pulled over a learner driver after spotting the instructor using his mobile phone during the lesson. The instructor was issued with a Traffic Offence Report after the car was pulled over in Greater Manchester earlier this week.  The student driving the white Toyota had spotted police patrols and stopped the car in Salford, Greater Manchester, on Tuesday, January 31. But police claim the instructor had not noticed as he was "engrossed in his mobile phone call", reports Manchester Evening News.   The instructor was issued a Traffic Offence Report (TOR) for using his mobile phone while under tuition, according to Greater Manchester Police. The force shared an image of the car next to an officer after the vehicle was pulled over. In a post, GMP Traffic said: "The instructor of this learning vehicle was so engrossed in his mobile phone call he failed to notice the #RPTF patrol on Great Clowes Street. "Luckily his student did and kindly pulled over. "Instructor issued with TOR for using a mobile phone under tuition."   People flocked to Manchester Evening New's Facebook page to comment on the incident. One person wrote: "Needs naming and shaming! People are paying good money for inferior services! In fact, needs his instructor license rescinding!" "I had a driving instructor who fell asleep. He only woke up when I went round a bend too fast and the car swung round the corner. Then on top of that, said he didn't know where he was in the area", another person claimed. A third person added: "This is a duty of care towards his or her pupils, disgusting behaviour". "So many instructors I see doing this. I would be fuming if I was paying them to play on phone", a fourth person said.
