HR software provider Ciphr looked at 50 UK cities to find out the top 15 cities offering the best job opportunities. Researchers compared multiple factors such as average earnings, recent salary growth, employment rate changes, unemployment rate, number of job listings, and the number of small and medium-sized businesses to identify the top 15 cities for job hunters. The study also took into consideration the local population’s general level of well-being, affordability and the city’s cost of living.  The city ranked the highest overall for job opportunities was Milton Keynes, with Oxford, York, St Albans, and Norwich also making the top 10. Milton Keynes, in Buckinghamshire, scored consistently well across multiple criteria, boasting a high average median wage of £38,613. The county’s average full-time salary is 17 percent above the UK average of £33,000, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics. It has also enjoyed a significant 9.4 percent salary growth over the last 12 months compared to the UK average of 1.3 percent.

Meanwhile, the number of job listings on Indeed currently stands at 201 per 10,000 working-age adults - the UK averages are 68 and 183 per 10,000 respectively. The city is less competitive in terms of housing affordability though, as typical homes cost an average of 9.1 times earnings and the average rental property will eat up around 32 percent of someone's gross pay.
