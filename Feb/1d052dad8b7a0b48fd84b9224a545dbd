Posting her outfit to Instagram, Holly excitedly waited in anticipation for Props Week, saying: “Let the unpredictability commence…good luck everyone.” Fans gushed over the gorgeous gown, with Hollywillsuk writing: “This dress is very unique I love it.” Lauraanderson1x said Holly is “always nailing the looks” while Lifeispasty joked: “What was the ice cream you bought with 3 different flavours? Reminds me of that.”
