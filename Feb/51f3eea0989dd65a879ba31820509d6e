The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has confirmed it is shutting the doors on 20 jobcentres in the next few weeks. The Government said it won't affect people's benefits as these jobcentres were all set up during the pandemic and were always meant to be temporary.

The closures are spread across the UK and are all expected to happen before the end of March.
