Manchester City are still reeling from the charges levelled against them by the Premier League earlier this week, with the defending champions having been hit with allegations of over 100 rule breaches relating to their financial activity over the last decade. They appear to be facing a highly uncertain future as things stand after the news was made official on Monday following a lengthy investigation by the Premier League sparked by the publication of leaked emails by German outlet Der Spiegel back in 2018. The emails suggested that City owner Sheikh Mansour had inflated the club's commercial figures in an attempt to get around financial restrictions, sparking a four-year Premier League inquest which has resulted in the charges being brought against them. City remain adamant that no wrongdoing has ever taken place, though, and are expected to enter into a long and drawn-out legal battle in an attempt to clear their name in due course. The situation leaves City facing the threat of being sanctioned if they are found guilty of the charges, with a range of punishments available to the powers that be in the Premier League if they fail to prove their innocence over the coming months. A points deduction and a hefty fine are said to be among the many options on the table, while it has been suggested that City could be relegated to the EFL or even the National League in a possible worst-case scenario.
