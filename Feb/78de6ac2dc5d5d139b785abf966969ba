A boy aged just 14 was found behind the wheel of a Land Rover with his drunk parents in the back of the vehicle in County Tyrone, police allege. The teenager was detained and charges have been brought following the incident in which the luxury SUV failed to stop when confronted by a police patrol. The PSNI claimed that the driver of the Land Rover Discovery refused to stop and attempted to flee before mounting a kerb in a post on the Police Mid Ulster Facebook page. The post read: "Last weekend was a busy one for officers across Mid Ulster. Whilst travelling to another incident a Dungannon crew has come across this Land Rover Discovery "After questioning the manner of driving they have tried to pull it over. On activating the blue lights the driver has failed to stop and tried to make off.  "The vehicle has entered the Newell Road before mounting a kerb and stopping. "On speaking with the driver, officers have discovered a 14-year-old behind the wheel. "To make matters worse, the child was accompanied by two passengers - his drunk parents." In connection with the incident on January 29, two people—a 59-year-old male and a 49-year-old woman—appeared at Enniskillen Magistrates Court on Monday. After being detained, the 14-year-old was released on police bail. Following their Monday court appearance, the couple were remanded in custody and the case was postponed until a later meeting of Dungannon Magistrates Court this month.
