Life goes on as normal at the Etihad Stadium as Manchester City start what promises to be an agonisingly long wait to decide if they have been found guilty of over 100 breaches of financial rules. The Premier League's four-year investigation has led to a high-profile case in which if Man City are found guilty, they could face severe consequences. Despite uncertainty around the unprecedented situation, Pep Guardiola must continue to guide his side through the 2022/23 season. The Citizens host Aston Villa this weekend as they look to close the gap on Arsenal at the top of the Premier League. But with their 'whole being' at stake over recent allegations, as believed by some club figures, Gary Neville has admitted he has 'sympathy' for Manchester United's rivals. City have also been compared to the Red Devils after the latter slipped to a 2-2 draw at home to managerless Leeds United on Wednesday. The Etihad club's financial controversy is unlikely to halt their spending this summer, and they are eyeing a heist of one of Chelsea's star players to bolster Guardiola's ranks. Express Sport provides all the latest news and updates coming out of City on and off the pitch. Follow LIVE updates below...
