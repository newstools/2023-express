Manchester City have today been charged by the Premier League for breaking financial rules following a four-year investigation. The league champions, who are expected to 'lawyer up,' could now face several possible sanctions including a points deduction if found guilty. The Premier League released a statement on Monday confirming that they had charged City with over 100 breaches of rules. The Premier League's findings have now been referred to a Commission under Premier League Rules W.3.4. It remains to be seen how this news will impact this season's current title race, with Arsenal currently five points ahead of City with a game in a hand. However, if found guilty, City could be hit with several punishments, including a points deduction, expulsion from the league, huge fines, stripped titles or transfer bans and spending limits. Renowned Arsenal fan Piers Morgan, meanwhile, has already called on the Premier League to deduct points following the revelations. Pep Guardiola defended the club last year after their Champions League ban for allegedly breaking financial fair play rules was overturned on appeal but vowed he would not stay at the club if it emerged they had lied to him. Speaking in August of last yea, he said: "I said to them: ‘If you lie to me, the day after I am not here. I will be out and I will not be your friend any more. I put my faith in you because I believe you 100% from day one and I defend the club because of that.’" Follow Express Sport's live blog below for all the latest on this developing story
