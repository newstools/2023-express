It looks like a stack of old dishes strewn across the sea bed but this crockery, and the ship it went down in, have just been granted special protection. The move by Historic England will stop divers from plundering the plates and other “exceptionally rare” ceramics. They were lost 167 years ago with an even more precious cargo – 70 souls –aboard Josephine Willis.  The shipwreck was discovered in 2018, lying 75ft below the waves in the Channel. When some cups, saucers and pots were brought up, unknown patterns were discovered. And some decorations on dishes still down in the deep have only previously been seen on damaged pots. The Josephine Willis packet ship set off for New Zealand – where many passengers planned new lives – on February 3, 1856. But four miles into its journey from Kent’s Folkestone Harbour, it collided with a steamer.  The wreck has been awarded “protection by scheduling” which means divers cannot even touch its contents. Historic England chief Duncan Wilson said: “The sinking of this ship is a sad story of ordinary people lost to the sea. “The rare cargo gives us clues to help improve our knowledge of the Victorian export ceramics industry.” Brave Captain Edward Canney was lost with Josephine Willis. His great-great-great-grandson James said: “I’m pleased the story is being told and the shipwreck protected.”
