From April, the state pension, disability and working age benefits will be uprated by 10.1 percent in line with the rate of inflation in September, the Chancellor confirmed in November. The uprating means that on average, a family on Universal Credit will benefit by almost £600 each month from April. As the cost of living crisis continues, this extra cash boost could be vital for families on low incomes. An estimated 19.2 million families and 39.8 million individuals across Great Britain currently in receipt of state pension or benefits from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) will see their payments go up by 10.1 percent later this year. The benefit cap will also rise in line with inflation. This will see it increase from £23,000 to £25,323 for families in Greater London and from £20,000 to £22,020 for families nationally. Lower caps for single households without children will rise from £15,410 to £16,967 in Greater London and from £13,400 to £14,753 nationally.
