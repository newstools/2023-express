Canvey Island in Essex and parts of London were badly affected by the worst storms to hit this country for more than 250 years. Official figures said 307 people lost their lives in the disaster, while more than 30,000 people were made homeless. 51 years ago (1972) A 30,000-strong crowd burned the British Embassy in Dublin as the funerals were held in Derry for 11 of the 14 people who were killed by British troops on Bloody Sunday. Other buildings in the Irish capital which had British connections were also targeted. 33 years ago (1990) South Africa’s President FW de Klerk began dismantling the country’s apartheid laws which enforced racial segregation. He also lifted the 30-year ban on the African National Congress and promised to release its leader Nelson Mandela, who was imprisoned for 27 years.
