Experts issued a safety warning after a huge increase in the number of fires caused by exploding lithium batteries in e-scooters and e-bikes. Data from the Chartered Trading Standards Institute found blazes more than doubled in a year.  Christine Heemskerk, the institute’s lead officer for product safety, said: “Don’t buy online unless you’re really certain where a product is coming from. “You also need to be very sure that you’re using the right charger for the right battery. “There should be a charger supplied with the device you’ve purchased.” Freedom of information data obtained by insurer Zurich revealed e-scooters and e-bikes were responsible for 167 fires in 2021, compared with just 67 in 2020. And blazes last year were on course to exceed 2021, with 161 incidents recorded to the end of September – a 28 per cent increase on the previous year’s monthly average. Fire-fighters in London alone attended 88 blazes caused by e-bikes in 2022. The equivalent figure in 2021 was 49.  Many fires have been attributed to conversion kits used to turn a standard bike into an electric one. The CTSI says consumers should check their vehicle displays a valid UKCA or CE safety mark. Alonso Ercilla, trading standards manager at the London Borough of Islington, said: “We advise anyone selling these devices to get them tested to make sure they comply with product safety laws.” And Will Norman, London’s walking and cycling commissioner, stressed that consumers must “be aware of the fire safety risks which come with using converted e-bikes from unverified suppliers”.
