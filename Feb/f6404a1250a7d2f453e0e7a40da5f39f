Chelsea owner Todd Boehly is said to have spied on Graham Potter's training sessions as pressure continues to mount on the Englishman. According to The Telegraph, there is a hope that results and performances will soon come as a result of the hard work being done on the training ground. Things reached a new low for the Blues under their new manager at the weekend as they were defeated 1-0 at Stamford Bridge by Southampton. The side currently bottom of the Premier League left West London with a deserved three points, as they faced little challenge from the hosts, particularly in the first half.Injury precautions caused the manager to rotate heavily from the side who were defeated in Dortmund, with crucial defenders Reece James and Thiago Silva the most notable omissions.The result has obviously resulted in more questions regarding Potter’s future, with it being well-documented amongst the Stamford Bridge faithful that their patience has run out. Even pundits in the media have now been discussing whether it would be a better option to bring in a new man at the helm instead of backing the former Brighton & Hove Albion man.Reports have continued to state though that the owners of the club are hopeful and confident that Potter can turn things around himself.The Telegraph have now claimed that they have been extremely impressed by the training and tactical analysis undertaken by the coaching staff including the manager after Boehly personally watched over some of the sessions.With it already being claimed that he will definitely be in charge for the Premier League match against Tottenham, it is likely that he will remain at the helm when the crucial Champions League match against Borussia Dortmund comes around. The Blues currently have a 1-0 deficit to turn around after defeat in Germany last week.Billionaire boss Boehly has been extremely busy in the past two transfer windows since his consortium bought Chelsea last May - and he is showing no signs of slowing down.According to Le Parisien, Boehly flew to Paris last week to discuss Neymar's future with PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi ahead of the French side's 1-0 defeat by Bayern Munich in the Champions League.Neymar is under contract with PSG until 2027, but their ropey form - they had lost three games in succession before a last-gap 4-3 win over Lille on Sunday - means nothing is certain.Nevertheless, it doesn’t look like Neymar will be pulling on a Chelsea shirt any time soon. L'Equipe reports that he wants to remain in the French capital for the foreseeable future.
