Laila Rouass, 47, shared a saucy Valentine's Day themed lingerie snap with almost 55,000 Instagram followers as she demonstrated exactly why she looks ravishing in red. Using the hashtag #fbf (flashback friday), she claimed she was going back to a time when "flock wallpaper was all the rage". However, after taking one look at her lacy red bra and matching knickers, @misterhsk quipped jokingly: "Yeah. Cos we're ALL looking at the wallpaper!" Meanwhile, TV presenter Sanjeez Bhaskar shot back: "What the actual flock!" before adding a heart emoji. Former Holby City star Laila, who has been in a relationship with snooker ace Ronnie O'Sullivan, received thousands of likes from fans after uploading the dimly lit yet intimate snap - and some quipped: "Flock me!"
