Former pupils of a school where it was allegedly an “open secret” that a PE teacher was sexually abusing boys hope to sue the local authority. Students scrawled on desks that PE teacher Michael Quinlan was a pervert who abused pupils throughout his career at the Royal Liberty School, from 1982 to 2003, according to solicitors.  They are considering a class action against the local authority for failing to safeguard children. Lawyers from Andrew Grove and Co representing victims are appealing for people to help investigate claims the teacher – now aged 73 – was able to abuse boys at the respected school. On a “Class of 1997” Facebook group for the school a former student posted a claim that Quinlan sexually abused boys at the comprehensive school for 11 to 16-year-olds, which opened in Gidea Park, east London, in 1921.  Quinlan was suspended in 2003 when a police probe began. He was found guilty in 2004 of historic sexual offences and served 15 months. Last May he appeared at Snaresbrook Crown Court charged with three counts of indecent assault on a boy under 14 and two counts of indecent assault on Andre Tyndall, who was 11 at the time. Quinlan was found guilty of all charges bar one count of indecent assault of Mr Tyndall, who has waived his right to anonymity in the hope others may come forward.  Quinlan was placed on the sex offenders’ register for life and given a 22-month suspended sentence. Mr Tyndall said: “Quinlan used to look at boys naked for sexual gratification, claiming he needed to check they were not wearing underwear underneath shorts.”  Lee Rafferty, Royal Liberty head, said: “Our sympathy goes out to the young men. We have strict policies and procedures in the school, across the Trust and within the Local Authority to mitigate against abuse.” A Havering Council spokesperson said: “We do want to stress we have strict policies and procedures in place in all our schools to protect Havering pupils.”
