Princess Eugenie's "unlikely" US move would be a "blip on the radar" for the Royal Family, an expert has said. The 32-year-old royal was reportedly spotted stateside recently amid rumours of a move across the pond with husband Jack Brooksbank.  However, a US-based royal commentator believes such a move would have little impact in the UK and America. Marlene Koenig, a royal historian focusing on blue-blooded Brits and Europeans, told Express.co.uk: "Eugenie is now the niece of the king, no longer the granddaughter of the Queen.

"She is listed as Eugenie York on LinkedIn and on the Hauser and Wirth website. "Most Americans have no idea who Princess Eugenie is and there would be limited coverage.

The couple, who tied the knot in October 2018 and are expecting their second child this summer, were said to have received details of homes from Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.
