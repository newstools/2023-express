British sniffer dogs are among rescue workers still working in Turkey this week, with four specially trained canines combing through the rubble of razed buildings. The team includes black labrador Sid, Colin the collie, Vesper, a black Belgian malinois and springer spaniel Davey. Together, they make up a vital presence within the UK Government-backed International Search and Rescue (ISAR) team and hail from different specialist fire services in the UK. The dogs have spent the last week with their handlers in Hatay province, one of the worst-hit in Turkey, where their heightened senses have helped locate men, women and children still trapped beneath debris. Videos show the dogs threading between pieces of concrete and metal to find people pinned underneath, where they also risk injury. While they are well-equipped with special harnesses, boots and hats, Colin was left with a â€œreally nasty cut" during one rescue attempt. He was nicked "down to the tendon" on a rear paw last week, and after attention from a vet and a brief rest, he was back in top form on Saturday, February 11. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
