Shocking video footage shows a stolen Kia smash through a shop front as part of an expensive bid to steal several cartons of cigarettes. The looter, who repeatedly rammed the facade before breaking through, later gave officers the slip when they arrived on scene. In the shocking clip, captured on the Cigar Land store's CCTV, the car drives through the glass and into the middle of the store. The crime at 7am on Wednesday in King County, Washington State is made all the more shocking given the thief made away with just a few cartons of cigarettes. When police show up, it appears they have the suspected crook boxed in with their police car. However, the thief was undetered. He jumps in the car and smashes further into the store before reversing out and around the cop car outside.  The unidentified man escaped and authorities in King County, Washington State are searching for the suspect. The employees at the store have already begun cleaning up the mess and Cigar Land was open for business the next day. "Tragedies don’t stop people from having to live their lives," Fantaysia Riley, an employee at the business, told FOX 13 News. She said the owner of the shop just took over earlier this month. "I don’t know where to start from here. I don’t know where he’s going to start from here. I guess just hope for the best, you can’t expect the worst anymore because the worst has happened," she added.
