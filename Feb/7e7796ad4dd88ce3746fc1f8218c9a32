He said: “Instead of making the wealthy pay their fair share, some Republicans … want Medicare and Social Security sunset.” The President also addressed controversial issues, garnering murmurs from the crowd as he spoke about the return of Roe v Wade, Medicare, police brutality and the fentanyl epidemic.
