Jessica Chastain, 45, has been compared to Jennifer Lawrence after the Hollywood actress got briefly caught in her dress on her way to accept a SAG Award last night. The Good Nurse actress was making her way to the stage in the live moment to accept the SAG Award for Best Female Actor in a TV movie or mini-series. She received some much-needed assistance from Irish actor Paul Mescal who was sat in the front row. Many viewers rushed to Twitter to comment on the SAG Awards mishap.
