Meghan Markle and Prince Harry have been warned they can no longer expect to receive the same treatment they got when they were senior members of the Firm. As non-working royals, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have now slipped down the pecking order and are likely to be invited to attend only events open to the whole family with seatings in less prominent positions. Royal author Katie Nicholl wrote for Vanity Fair: "Now that they are no longer working royals, the Sussexes can expect to be treated the same way as Harry’s cousins Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, who attend important family occasions but are not in the spotlight and do not appear on the Buckingham Palace balcony." The Palace has already let it be known only full-time working royals will be invited to make a balcony appearance during Coronation weekend in May. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES…
