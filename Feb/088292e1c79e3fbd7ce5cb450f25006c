Gregg Wallace, who fronts the popular BBC cooking show and its spin-offs alongside John Torode, has been recognised for services to food and charity, as he accepted the prestigious award from Princess Anne. Taking to his Instagram Stories today, the popular broadcaster shared a photo alongside his wife Anne-Marie Sterpini. The couple looked chic as Gregg sported a light blue waiscoat teamed with grey trousers and a navy blue tailcoat. His other half looked equally smart in floral black and pink dress which she accompanied with a pink jacket and a matching fascinator. Gregg captioned the post: "Off to Windsor Castle."
