If you use Sky TV it might be worth checking your inbox. The satellite TV company recently revealed that it will be hiking prices by an average of 8.1 percent from April 1 and now those increases are being confirmed with customers finding out just how much extra they will soon pay. Due to the way in which Sky works out its yearly rises, each customer will face a unique amount being added to their bill. That's why it's important to check your emails as this will confirm the exact rise coming this April. For example, an email seen by Express.co.uk shows one customer facing a hike of £5 extra per month. That is split between Sky Entertainment going up by £2, Sky HD rising by £1 and Sky Sports by £2. Clearly, the more things you subscribe to the bigger your bill will get come April 1. Explaining more about its hikes, Sky said: "At Sky, we’re all about bringing you the unmissable entertainment you love. We know that reliability is important. That’s why we continually invest in making our services even better. "We understand that things are tough right now, and alongside investing in improvements, we’re committed to keeping our prices as low as we can. "The costs of providing services have however increased significantly, and it is affecting the entire industry."

For example, BT is added a whopping 14.4 percent to bills and Virgin Media is hiking costs by an average of 13.8 percent. Other firms that announced hikes of over 14 percent include EE, Plusnet, TalkTalk and Shell Energy. Here are all the increases announced so far by UK TV and broadband firms.

For those not aware, ITVX offers instant access to over 10,000 hours of free catch-up TV, movies and box sets such as Broadchurch, Vera and Love Island. Movies currently available also include Back to the Future, The Green Mile, Reservoir Dogs and The Aviator.
