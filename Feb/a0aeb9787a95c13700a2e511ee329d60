  The Dancing On Ice professional was pictured leaving the reality star’s house at 10.30am, wearing a bright orange puffer jacket and some black leggings, Express.co.uk can exclusively report. Joey wore a red varsity jacket over a white hoodie and some black tracksuit bottoms in preparation for their day of training on the ice. The pair appeared to be laughing together over some hot beverages as they enjoyed a casual breakfast. Joey and Vanessa are believed to have then returned to the I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! star’s mansion at midday to grab their bags, before hopping into a waiting taxi to take them to the ice rink.  Joey appeared to hint at a romance between himself and Vanessa a few weeks ago during Dancing On Ice, as host Holly Willoughby asked the pair on musicals week: “You’re like a real-life Sandy and Danny out there, have you got something you want to tell us you two?” Although Vanessa laughed at the question and kept quiet, Joey replied: “Danny and Sandy are getting on pretty well, if you know what I mean.” Cheekily winking at the camera, Phillip Schofield asked the TOWIE star if he was confirming there was more to their relationship. Putting his hands up in defence, Joey commented: “I’m not confirming anything.” Express.co.uk has contacted Joey Essex and Vanessa Bauer representatives for comment.
