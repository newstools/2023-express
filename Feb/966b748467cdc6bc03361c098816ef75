Interest rates on savings accounts are at their highest level in more than 10 years following consecutive Bank of England Base Rate increases over the last year. It's good news for savers who are being offered a better return on savings - Yorkshire Building Society customers can get up to 4.5 percent interest.  Yorkshire Building Society is offering a number of savings accounts that may appeal to Britons looking to get a good rate on their savings. The Building Society’s Rainy Day Account (Issue Two) is offering a competitive interest rate of 3.5 percent and savers can get started with as little as £1. Alternatively, its Christmas Regular Saver account is offering an interest rate of 4.5 percent to help people save for next Christmas. This account allows customers to deposit between £1 and £300 per month and they can access their savings on one day in the year without penalty.

The 3.35 percent rate is applied to balances up to £5,000, while a 2.85 percent rate is applied to balances over £5,000.01 with two withdrawals allowed every year.    Meanwhile, Lloyds Bank’s Club Lloyds Monthly Saver is offering an AER of 5.25 percent. A £25 deposit is required to open this account and the term runs for 12 months, which means up to £4,800 can be invested over the course of the year. NatWest’s Digital Regular Saver falls just behind with an AER of 5.12 percent. The 5.12 percent interest rate is awarded to savings up to £5,000, after which a 0.65 percent rate will be awarded to figures from £5,001 and over.   Santander has also just increased the interest rate on its current accounts - offering £396 boost each year.  The bank announced earlier today that it is raising the in-credit interest rate on its 1I2I3, Select and Private Current Accounts. Following this rate hike, a monthly interest rate of two percent AER/1.98 percent gross (variable) will be paid on balances up to £20,000. With this new 2.0 percent rate, customers can get up to £396.38 in interest on their account each year, based on a continuous balance of £20,000.
