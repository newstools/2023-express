The Brooklyn Nets look like they have found an ideal replacement for Kyrie Irving in a man who is on the team already. The Nets were forced to trade Irving away after he demanded a trade following a breakdown in communications. It all looked rosey for Irving and the Nets moving forward, with the point guard giving the team an indication that he'd like to remain in Brooklyn and sign a long-term deal. That offer came in, but was said to have featured a stipulation which angered Irving, as The Athletic reporter Shams Charania stated that he 'vehemently disagreed' with what was written into his deal, and he handed in a transfer request. The Nets knew that Irving was about to leave either way, with his contract set to expire in the summer and having little belief that he would resign with the team, as the Los Angeles Lakers interest became apparent. And therefore, the team decided to take the best available offer, which came from the Dallas Mavericks, with Brooklyn receiving solid starting players Spencer Dinwiddie and Dorian Finney-Smith as well as a first-round pick. Without Irving, an opportunity has come for a ball-dominant guard to see more plays called for him, to pick up the slack left after the point guard's departure. And second-year pro Cam Thomas has grasped that opportunity with both hands, having dominant performances scoring 40 points in three consecutive games. In doing so, Thomas became the youngest player ever in NBA history to score 40 points on three straight games, at tge age of just 21.  Although not a like-for-like replacement, Thomas is a score-first guard who can do much of what Irving used to, whilst being a raw prospect. Taking at the end of the first round in the 2021 class from LSU, primarily a footballing programme rather than basketball, Thomas has shown flashes throughout his career, but has taken a huge leap since Irving's exit.
