A hole was cut into the bottom of the vat to help rescue the pair. The tank was supposedly waist-high in chocolate. Over two dozen rescuers responded and one worker was taken to hospital by helicopter, local reports have revealed. However, neither of the two workers sustained any injuries. JUST IN: De La Soul rapper David Jolicoeur ‘Trugoy the Dove’ dies at 54 Regulators described the incident, which occurred at the factory in Elizabethtown in Pennsylvania, as "serious". Workers were hired to clean the tanks but were not provided with proper safety training. The OHSA said: "Employees of an outside employer, IK Stoltzfus Service Corporation, cleaned tanks, including the Dove chocolate batching 20 micron tank, owned by the onsite/host employer, Mars Wrigley. "The host employer did not provide the outside employer with the correct energy control procedure or work authorisation permit that included verification of flowable material isolation given the permitted entry, on or about June 9, 2022."  Dove chocolate, a brand sold in the US, is sold as Galaxy in the UK. Mars and Wrigley merged in 2008 and produces other popular sweets, including Snickers. A representative for Mars Wrigley welcomed the outcome of Osha's investigation. A spokesperson said: "The safety of our associates and outside contractors is a top priority for our business."
