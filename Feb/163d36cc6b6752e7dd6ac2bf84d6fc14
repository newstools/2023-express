Sadly, while The Father used shifting perspectives and clever editing to create a cinematic experience, The Son remains moored to its theatrical origins.  High-flying New York lawyer Peter Miller (Hugh Jackman) left his wife Kate (Laura Dern) and teenage son Nicholas (Zen McGrath) to raise a baby with his mistress Beth (Vanessa Kirby). Their divorce appears to cut the deepest for Nicholas who is clearly suffering from serious mental health problems. In desperation, Kate agrees to let the lad move in with his father and new partner.  Sadly, the relentlessly upbeat Peter has father issues of his own and isn’t emotionally equipped to deal with his boy’s chronic depression. There are some heartbreaking moments but the tone is relentlessly grim, the performances are stilted and the outcome is predictable.
