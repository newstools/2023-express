 At a fan convention in Oregon on Saturday, Michael J Fox, 61, joined his former co-stars Lea Thompson, 61, Christopher Lloyd, 84 and Tom Wilson, 63. Lea, who starred as Lorraine Baines in the franchise, shared the heartwarming reunion with her 380,000 Instagram followers in a series of snaps and short clips. Michael, who was diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease at the age of 30, was seen by fans slightly staggering around the event as a result of the disease but otherwise appeared in high spirits as he joined his former castmates. Since his diagnosis the star had devoted much of his time and assets to raising money for Parkinson’s research, collecting over $1billion for the cause through his Michael J Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research. The Family Ties star took to his own Instagram during the event, sharing a sweet snap with his three co-stars on his Instagram story.
