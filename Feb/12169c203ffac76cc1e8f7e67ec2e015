A town was left shocked after a loose cow caused traffic havoc and collided with a Tesla. The electric car was driving in Pleasanton when a cow, “rambling” freely in the road, hit the vehicle. Police said on Twitter: “This evening we received multiple calls about a loose cow causing slowdowns along Bernal and Stanley. “Our team of officers quickly responded and spotted a brown cow. “Despite a cow-llision with a sedan, the cow safely returned home. There were no reported injuries.” The Tesla Model S’ front windshield was left shattered, pictures from the police show. The runaway cattle was reported at around 8pm, and hit a Tesla Model S but was not injured. Caroline, a witness to the bizarre scenes while walking her dog, told NBC Bay Area that she could “hear horse feet or clomping” in the area. “We look back and we saw a cow running down the street, and a guy running behind it trying to lasso it. “It was crazy, I was like ‘what is going on’.” READ MORE: Texas truck slides down frozen Fort Worth road Officer Marty Billdt also told the station: “A brown cow running down, we’re getting updates over - we’ve just heard 50 calls from people. “We started to give chase to try and corral it, and weren’t too successful.” He said the bovine breakaway managed to get past several stores and businesses. “The cow was a sneaky little cow”, he remarked. “And was able to get out between the cars.” Follow our social media accounts here on facebook.com/ExpressUSNews and @expressusnews
