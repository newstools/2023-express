But that’s because it actually has a different name than what the Earl of Wessex refers to it as. The Sunday Post reported that Prince Edward enjoys eating what he calls “Balmoral Butties”. The Earl of Wessex named the food after Balmoral Castle, which was his late mother’s holiday home located in Scotland.  Prince Edward was born on March 10, 1964. At the time of his birth, he was third in line to the throne behind only his two older brothers then-Prince Charles and Prince Andrew. Today, he’s 13th in the line of succession and unlike his siblings, Edward is not a Duke.   But it could happen after King Charles' coronation on May 6, 2023.
