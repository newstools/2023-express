Golf influencer Paige Spiranac wants to see Tiger Woods repeat his tampon-giving gesture to Phil Mickelson should the two golfing rivals ever meet in a 'LIV vs PGA Tour Ryder Cup type event'. Woods is playing in his first non-major event since October 2020 at the Genesis Invitational this week. He was grouped with close friends Justin Thomas and Rory McIlroy with the trio seen sharing some laughs throughout their opening round. They were all close in scoring as well after the front nine with all three on one-under par. And Woods had surprised many with the length of his driving, even pushing his ball further than his two playing partners on occasions. The 15-time major champion was then spotted handing Thomas a tampon in jest after outdriving his compatriot once again on the ninth. The pair shared a laugh about the joke after walking off the tee box, but the incident drew a mixed response on social media. Woods was under scrutiny by many, but Spiranac showed her support for the golfing icon.  "If anyone tries to cancel Tiger over this we riot. It's funny," she tweeted. And the top influencer went on to state her wish to see Woods repeat the same gesture for Mickelson. "I need a LIV vs PGA tour Ryder cup type event just so Tiger can give Phil a tampon after out driving him," she added. Neither Thomas or Woods were asked about the incident in their post-round interviews.  The American duo have struck up a close friendship over the years with Woods considering Thomas as family. "We have become so close that I think Charlie's like Justin's little brother he never had and Justin has become the little brother I never had," Woods said recently. "We are extremely close with the family and we do a lot of things together, and to be able to have that experience tomorrow again. "You know, we don't want them wearing that belt again, so we are going to give it our best. Christmas dinner wasn't quite as pleasurable last year as it hopefully will be this year."
