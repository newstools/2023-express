Manchester United co-owner Avram Glazer will be in attendance this afternoon at Wembley as Erik ten Hag's side look to end the club's six-year trophy drought by beating Newcastle in the Carabao Cup final. It was just last week that three bids for a full takeover of United were sent to US investment firm Raine Group, who are looking after negotiations for the Glazers. Each party have now been given access to the 'data room', where relevant financial information will be made available. But it's been suggested that the Glazers still haven't decided whether or not they will sell the club with both Avram and Joel Glazer still emotionally invested in the club. The former will be at Wembley as United take on Newcastle in the Carabao Cup final today. It's the club's first Carabao Cup final since winning the competition back in 2017 under Jose Mourinho. There's a feeling around Old Trafford that a win at Wembley today could spark even more trophies under Ten Hag. United remain in all four competitions that they started the season in and are one of the favourites to win the Europa League.
