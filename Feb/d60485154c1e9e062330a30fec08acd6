A builder died after falling asleep in the DJ booth of a nightclub which burnt down, a coroner heard. Tomas Ceida, 28, was working at Studio 338 in Greenwich, southeast London, when the fire broke out in August 2016. The Lithuanian-born labourer was rescued by a firefighter and the nightclub’s manager after he was seen crawling through the inferno “fully alight”.It is believed he fell asleep in the DJ booth after working late and became trapped when the fire broke out at around 11.45am on August 8.Around 15 people were working at the club at the time but Tomas was the only fatality, the court heard.More than 100 firefighters tackled the blaze, which spread to a nearby industrial warehouse and a recycling yard. Southwark Coroner’s Court heard this week Tomas, who was living in Grays, Essex, at the time, had full thickness burns to 75% of his body and died in hospital a day later.A pathologist gave a cause of death as burns and inhalation of fire fumes.The inquest, which is being heard by a jury, heard the fire may have been started by sparks falling from power tools being used on a steel beam on the roof.Matthew Cullen, from the fire investigations team at the London Fire Brigade, said CCTV shows a “shower of hot sparks” falling from the roof down to a ‘soundproof wall’ before the fire started.He said the wall was constructed of a timber frame stuffed with bales of straw and covered in a layer of ‘fake vegetation’.He told jurors: “I have never encountered a wall like that.” It was said the building was gutted in around 25 minutes.Mr Cullen told the court the LFB found canisters used in oxyacetylene welding, also known as gas welding, which had fire damaged hoses attached, and disc cutters.They also found a 1.3m long steel beam on the roof.Mr Cullen said: “We have CCTV footage from outside the nightclub in the recycling yard adjacent, which showed two people on the roof doing works that generated a lot of sparks during the course of the morning.“They were working above the area where we saw the fire start. We know from experience that sparks generated by hot works, whether it be by disc cutting or oxyacetylene work, are very adept at starting a fire particularly where the wall is constructed of something like straw.”Police arrested a number of the labourers at the scene on suspicion of arson but all were released without charge. Mr Cullen confirmed to jurors the London Fire Brigade found no evidence of arson during their investigation.At the time, Studio 338 paid tribute to Tomas, saying "our hearts are smashed and broken".The statement said: "Tomas fought for as long as he could given the extent of his injuries. He was as strong as an ox but it was too much even for him."He was so pure and beautiful, an inspiration to us all: always positive, never complaining, working through the night to make sure the parties were the best they could be for you and us."We are all so devastated to lose him like this. Everything we do from now on is for you, our brother."The inquest continues.
