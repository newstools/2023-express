Nicola Bulley's friends have slammed "disgusting" theories that her partner is involved in her disappearance. The disappearance of Nicola has led to a number of sick conspiracies surrounding her whereabouts after specialist search teams were brought in in an attempt to find her, which have been condemned by the police as being unhelpful. The mum-of-two has been missing since Friday, January 27 as the search continues. The mum-of-two's friends have now been forced to defend her heartbroken partner Paul Ansell after people online began circulating wild theories that he was involved. Nicola's friend Tilly Ann released a statement with the family's permission to dispel the rumours. She said: "Paul and Nikki both mostly work from home which is why he was at home that day. "They have CCTV and there is a reason why Paul has never been a suspect.  "Family and friends need these accusations to stop immediately. The fact that I've had to write this is disgusting to be honest." Paul released another heartfelt plea over the weekend as the search for Nicola continued. He said the family needs a "happy ending to this nightmare". Paul added: "The agony continues but the hope is stronger than ever of finding you."
