Manchester United were put up for sale last autumn, with the Glazer family owners reportedly seeking £5billion in exchange for the 13-time Premier League champions. Sheikh Jassim Bin Hamid Al Thani and Sir Jim Ratcliffe appear to be the frontrunners to buy the club after submitting offers earlier this month. And they are now said to be looking for clarity about the next stage of the sale. On Monday, the United share price declined by 9.61 per cent to close the day at £17.13 ($20.62). The shares had flown all the way up to £22.70 ($27.32) after Sheikh Jassim and Ratcliffe had put their offers forward on the day of the soft deadline. But they have since retracted by almost 25 per cent amid concerns a sale of the club won’t happen. United have enjoyed a precipitous upturn in fortunes under Erik ten Hag this season and won their first trophy of the campaign on Sunday when they defeated Newcastle 2-0 in the Carabao Cup final. The Red Devils had seen off Barcelona in the second leg of the Europa League play-offs just days earlier and are now the favourites to win Europe's second-tier club competition. Ten Hag’s side have also climbed to third in the Premier League table and have an outside chance of winning the title for the first time since 2013. And with an FA Cup fifth round showdown with West Ham to look forward to on Wednesday night, the mood at Old Trafford is certainly bright.
