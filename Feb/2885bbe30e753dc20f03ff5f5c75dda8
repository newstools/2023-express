Dr Mine Conkbayir, a member of the Practitioners of the Early Years Sector, said: “We are well accustomed to MPs and royalty vising early years settings. But nothing is done.   “The time has long passed for ‘awareness’. We need action – long-term investment and funding in the early years.” The reasons for Dr Mine’s comments stem from the fact that while awareness can help raise the profile of a cause, it doesn’t necessarily lead to any additional funding.

Such has been the pressure on some childcare providers than they were now “having to turn to food charities to provide nutritious meals for children” added Dr Conkbayir. She criticised the government funding, describing it as “paltry”. Most notably Dr Conkbayir took aim at Princess Kate’s latest campaign and the Royal Foundation for Early Childhood she founded. Among her criticisms were that no early years experts were on the team that wrote a key report for the foundation last year.  Despite this detail, the announcement of the Shaping Us campaign marks a distinct change in direction for the current Princess of Wales who has declared her future efforts in Early Years sector to be her life’s work.   It was to this end that the Shaping Us campaign was launched.   In a video message at the launch of the campaign, the Princess said: “Our early childhood, the time from pregnancy to the age of five, fundamentally shapes the rest of our lives. “But as a society, we currently spend much more of our time and energy on later life. Today the Royal Foundation Centre for Early Childhood is launching a new campaign, Shaping Us, to raise awareness of the life-changing impact we can have when we build a supportive, nurturing world around children and those who care for them.”
