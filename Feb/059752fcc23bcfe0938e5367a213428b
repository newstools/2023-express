A Place in the Sun host Laura Hamilton, 40, took a break from assisting guests with finding their dream homes and followed the advice of Strictly's Tess Daly, 53, instead, who recommended the perfect holiday location for her. Together with luxury swimwear brand Naia Beach co-founder Gayle Lawton, Tess suggested Laura try out the Rixos The Palm hotel in the UAE. Lounging on the beach contentedly while clad in their brand, Laura thanked them for "recommending such an amazing place" and vowed she would be "living in @naia_beach all week". True to her word, she showed off a skimpy zebra-patterned bikini in one photoshoot, and a bright red halterneck bralet from the brand in another. Her idyllic surroundings offered panoramic views of the Arabian Gulf, but Laura wasn't being entirely self-indulgent as she swapped lazing on the sandy beach for lifting weights on it instead, helped by her attentive children.
