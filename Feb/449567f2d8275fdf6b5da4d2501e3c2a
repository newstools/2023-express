A ring of steel has been set up around Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, while Westminster has been placed on high alert for security threats. Mr Zelensky is currently travelling across London, surrounded by a fleet of armoured cars, after arriving in Stansted airport earlier this morning. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who met him at the airport, is travelling with Mr Zelensky to Downing Street. The two leaders shared a warm hug after the Ukrainian President touched down on the tarmac at Stansted. Foreign Secretary James Cleverly was also in situ to greet Mr Zelensky.  The Ukrainian leader is set to give an address to MPs in Westminster Hall this afternoon, before visiting troops in the South West with Mr Sunak. The two leaders will give a joint press conference this afternoon.  Later today, Mr Zelensky will also meet with King Charles III at the royal residence this afternoon. Mr Zelensky will use the surprise visit to see Ukrainian troops being trained by the British armed forces.  Mr Sunak announced plans for the British Armed Forces to train Ukrainian pilots, paving the way for them to be able to fly sophisticated NATO-standard jets. More than 10,000 Ukrainian troops have so far been trained at bases throughout the UK, with training being given recently on how to use Challenger 2 tanks being sent from Britain to to Ukraine. This is Mr Zelensky's first UK visit since the Ukraine war began last February. It is only his second international trip since the start of the conflict. UPDATES TO FOLLOW...
