A man has been jailed after stabbing a mourner several times at a funeral. Nathan Bibby, 36, of Common Road, Potton, Bedfordshire, attacked the victim outside a pub where a wake was being held leaving the victim with multiple stab wounds and a punctured lung. Police branded the attack as "extremely violent" saying it was only through "sheer luck" there were not more grave consequences for the victim.  The court heard that the defendant left the venue following an argument with a man but returned later armed with a knife. The victim suffered several stab wounds to the torso in front of witnesses before Bibby fled the scene. He was arrested and later charged with wounding with intent and possession of a bladed article. During a hearing at Luton Crown Court Bibby admitted the charges. Bibby was sentenced to six years and two months in prison for wounding with intent and one year for possession of a bladed article, each to run concurrently. He was also sentenced to four months, to run consecutively, for breaching the suspended sentence order he had been given for a prior assault on an emergency service worker. Detective Constable Jack Heredia, who led the investigation said the attack was "extremely violent" with the victim left with "serious injuries".
