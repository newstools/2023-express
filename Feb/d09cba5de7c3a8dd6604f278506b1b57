Kate Garraway, 55, was the epitome of chic this morning when she was spotted in London wearing baby pink flares. The Good Morning Britain presenter could be seen smiling for the cameras, putting on a brave face amid her husband Derek Draper’s long Covid battle. Kate could be seen carrying a big pile of newspapers, while pulling along a small suitcase. The TV presenter paired the head-turning flares with a navy shearling coat and a matching turtleneck. The appearance comes comes just days after Kate took to social media to share a moment of hope after a "tricky 48 hours”. The broadcaster uploaded a close-up picture of some yellow flowers, adding in the caption: “So this is why I love nature and gardening so much - after a tricky 48 hours of feeling like am trudging up hill on ice my first crocus bursts up - the spirit of life and hope in gorgeous yellow form!! @smoothradio #lovenature #hope #love.
