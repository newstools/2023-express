Fortnite developer Epic Games has released a surprise new update for February 7. As part of the new Fortnite update, Geralt of Rivia has joined the Battle Pass, which means you can now unlock the popular character from The Witcher. If you want to start unlocking Geralt's outfit and items, then you'll need to start completing his quests, the first page of which is available now. The second page of Geralt's quests will open up on February 28, alongside the release of update 23.50. Needless to say, you'll need to own the Battle Pass in order to unlock the Geralt of Rivia items and skins. Fortunately, however, there are additional Witcher items available without the need for a Battle Pass. It's all part of the Fortnite School of Llama challenges, which is made up of four different paths. Epic Games explains more: "As you progress through each path, you’ll be challenged with in-game tasks that can be completed in Battle Royale and Zero Build. "Finishing a task unlocks the next one, until you reach an obstacle. Upon reaching an obstacle, players will be presented with a creator-made island centered on a particular School of Llama sign. "Complete all creator-made islands and unlock the School of the Llama Emoticon!" Completing the first path unlocks the Witcher Silver Sword pickaxe, while the second path unlocks the Geralt of Rivia lobby track. Completing the third and fourth paths reward players with a grand total of 160,000 XP. Furthermore, each school is worth a new emoticon, including the School of the Cat Emoticon, the School of the Griffin Emoticon, School of the Viper Emoticon, and the School of the Bear Emoticon. Outside of Witcher content, the surprise midweek Fortnite update unvaults the Slurp Juice for use in Battle Royale.
