Manchester United will be hoping to maintain their impressive run of form in the Premier League by defeating managerless Leeds United in tonight's hotly-anticipated clash at Old Trafford. The Red Devils have won each of their four games since losing to table-toppers Arsenal at the end of last month and will be the overwhelming favourites to claim all three points against Leeds, who are still without a permanent head coach in the dugout after sacking Jesse Marsch earlier this week. Tonight's match will not be shown live in the UK due to Premier League broadcast rules, which state that if a game not selected for broadcast is postponed then the rearranged fixture is still not able to be shown on TV. The original date was scheduled for September but was postponed in the wake of the Queen's death, leading to the clash being pushed back to this week. It remains to be seen whether United will be able to take full advantage of Leeds' recent on-pitch woes by putting the Whites to the sword over the course of the 90 minutes, although Erik ten Hag insisted in yesterday's press conference that it will be important to prepare for a possible change in style brought on by Marsch's departure. "We have to be aware of that," said the Red Devils manager. "When Jesse was at Leeds, it was clear how they play, their way of play, system, style. Now, it's possible they change but it's also possible they don't change. We will find out on the pitch tomorrow and then we need good anticipation on that if they change, and if not, we know what to do." Follow Express Sport's live updates below.
