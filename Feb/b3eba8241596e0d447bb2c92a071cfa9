  Helen put her new breasts on full display as she posed in a stunning red dress for some pictures that left little to the imagination. The glamorous Valentine's Day outfit featured a plunging neckline, a structured top and matching skirt, which paired together give the illusion of a figure-hugging maxi dress. The former I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! star shared a video of herself trying on the garment with fans, captioning the clip: “Fave Valentines outfit [rose emoji].” Helen revealed to her followers that she had decided to have breast surgery last month in a bid to feel "more confident" after going from an E-Cup to a B-Cup, and claiming her boobs were "saggy."
