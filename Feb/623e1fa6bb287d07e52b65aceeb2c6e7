Numerous players have been signed over the course of the last two transfer windows, though very only one regular first-team star has been offloaded.

Potter himself has also admitted that he has done very little to justify why he remains well-supported, though a change of face in the dugout remains very unlikely. Though it has emerged that the 47-year-old does not believe he is solely to blame for his side’s poor form, per reports. According to the Daily Mail, Potter fears that his training sessions are being ‘undermined’ by having too many players to work with.
