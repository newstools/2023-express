British tennis star Cameron Norrie won the fifth ATP singles title of his career by getting his sweet revenge over former world No.1 Carlos Alcaraz. Last year's US Open winner Alcaraz beat the British No.1 in the Argentina Open final a week earlier and said he felt guilty afterwards. World No.12 Norrie had to work hard for the ATP 500 title win after losing the opening set 5-7 against the world No.2. However, the British star came fighting back winning the next two sets 6-4,7-5 to secure his second title on clay. "I had to battle a lot of demons in the last couple of weeks but managed to play well in the big moments and that's what it took today," Norrie sad post-match. "It's so special to win this one especially after losing a couple of finals already this year. "I had to do it the tough way, I was a set and a break down and 0-30 on my serve. I managed to flick a switch and turn it around, so it was a good day."
