Part of the M25 was closed this rush hour due to a severe crash. Commuters faced lengthy delays on the anticlockwise carriageway from junction nine for Leatherhead, Surrey to junction six for Godstone in the same county. The road, which orbits London, was closed from junction eight at Reigate, Surrey to junction six. The crash happened in the early hours just after the Reigate exit, Surrey Live reports. It left a car overturned. Surrey Police led the response and all emergency services dashed to the scene, National Highways said in an update. Strategic diversions were implemented to help ease traffic congestion. An update from traffic data company Inrix, posted at 4.01am, stated that the motorway had been closed due to an "overturned vehicle from J8 A217 Brighton Road (Reigate) to J6 A22 (Godstone)". Inrix also noted that police "have now closed the entire carriageway". Surrey police have indicated that the road was likely to remain closed for a number of hours throughout the morning for investigation work at the scene.  Traffic was also slow on the clockwise carriageway from junction seven for the M23 to junction eight due to onlookers. And due to the congestion, traffic was heavy on the M23 north in the build-up to the M25 link. It was slow from near junction nine for Gatwick Airport. The diversion for anticlockwise drivers on the M25 saw them exit at the Reigate junction and use local roads through Reigate and Redhill, and then the A25 eastbound through Bletchingley and Godstone. Drivers rejoined the motorway at junction six for Godstone itself and continued anticlockwise. It meant, though, local roads were also congested as a result, and these included the A25, which was slow in Redhill.
