Two policemen - a Metropolitan Police constable and a Kent Police sergeant - will face misconduct cases relating to disgraced ex-policeman Wayne Couzens. The cases will cover the handling of reports of indecent exposure by former Met officer Wayne Couzens before he murdered Sarah Everard, the Independent Office for Police Conduct said. The Met Police constable will answer a case for gross misconduct, while the Kent Police sergeant attends a meeting over separate reports of Couzens flashing. Couzens, 49, pleaded guilty on Monday, February 13 to three counts of indecent exposure in Kent between November 2020 and February 2021. Sal Naseem, the IOPC Regional Director, said officials within the Kent and Metropolitan police would decide whether the allegations are proven based on evidence the forces have gathered. He said: "We have been unable to publish our findings until now due to the risk of prejudicing criminal proceedings against Couzens. "Now that those have concluded it will be for the Metropolitan and Kent police forces to organise disciplinary proceedings which will consider the evidence we have gathered and determine whether the allegations against the officers are proven or not."
