An MP has spoken out as he slams people turning up at St Michael's on Wyre for "hampering" the investigation into Nicola Bulley's disappearance. Speaking during Home Office questions, the MP for Blackpool North and Cleveleys said: “Would the minister join me in imploring people to avoid the speculation, and the gossip, and the guesswork that has been going on, people descending upon St Michael’s on Wyre?  "It’s actually hampering this investigation and causing inordinate distress to Nicola’s family." Home Office minister Chris Philp agreed, adding: "It’s important that the public respect the family’s need for privacy at what is obviously an extremely difficult, upsetting and unimaginably distressing time. It’s important they let the police get on with their work, and the local authority as well. "If anyone has any information at all, however minor or innocuous it may seem to them, please do come forward and share it with the local police, but anything at all could help them get to the bottom of this." The 45-year-old was last seen on a riverside dog walk in St Michael's on Wyre in Lancashire 10 days ago.
