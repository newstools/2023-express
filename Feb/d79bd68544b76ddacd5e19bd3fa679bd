Liz showed off her modelling credentials as she wowed in a very small bikini from her own collection yesterday. The 57-year-old didnâ€™t appear to have aged a day as she showcased her svelte physique by the ocean. Liz stared seductively down the camera while posing by the beautiful coastline. She then later wrapped up in a gorgeous robe that was adorned with a tropical print. In one photo she stood against a stone column while another featured her strutting into a sun-drenched location with the gown trailing behind her. Introducing the product to her fans, she said: "Lo! A wondrous new robe from @elizabethhurleybeach The Parrot Robe. V limited edition." (sic) She also attached a link to her website and a string of heart emojis. Her followers were blown away by the show-stopping images, as one called her "unreal" and a second dubbed her a "queen".
