An “exceptional” Navy Seal has died in a tragic free-fall parachuting accident. Chief Special Warfare Operator Michael T. Ernst died on February 19 in Marana, Arizona during a parachute training exercise. "Our thoughts and prayers are with the Ernst family," Rear Admiral Keith Davids, leader of Naval Special Warfare Command, said in tribute to Ernst. "Mike was an exceptional teammate. He was a dedicated NSW Sailor who applied his talents and skills towards some of our nation’s hardest challenges, while selflessly mentoring his teammates. "Mike and his family will always be part of the NSW family, and he will never be forgotten.” He was taken to Banner University Medical Center in Phoenix but pronounced dead shortly after 2pm, officials said in a statement. The cause of the incident was not immediately clear and remains under investigation. "It would be inappropriate to comment further on the ongoing investigation until complete," the Naval Special Warfare Command said. Ernst, from Massachusetts, enlisted in the Navy in 2009 and joined his first naval special warfare unit three years later. He was serving in an East Coast-based naval special warfare unit at the time of the parachute training incident.

While the precise details on Ernst’s death have not been released, it is believed to be the first fatal accident involving a Navy SEAL in six years. In May 2017, Remington Peters, a SEAL and member of the Leap Frogs parachute demonstration team, died in New York City. The 27-year-old fell into the harbour near the Statue of Liberty.
