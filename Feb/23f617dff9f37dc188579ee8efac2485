Northern Ireland benefits from the Consumer Council’s fuel price checker, which helps promote competitiveness across the country. Its latest data, from last week, shows that diesel is 162.5p and petrol is just 143.7p per litre. The tool has been hailed by experts as being one of the best ways to force prices down for drivers during the cost of living crisis. For example, drivers in Strabane are seeing an average price of 151.9p per litre for diesel, compared to the most expensive region of Magherafelt, although it is still cheaper than the rest of the UK. Strabane, in County Tyrone, also has the lowest petrol price, at just 134.7p per litre, with prices like that not being seen since 2021.
