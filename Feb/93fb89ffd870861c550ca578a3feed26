Chelsea fans slated Mason Mount after the midfielder was seen sharing a laugh with West Ham goalscorer Emerson Palmieri after the Blues’ disappointing 1-1 draw. Former Chelsea defender Emerson struck the equaliser in yet another poor result for Graham Potter’s side. Mount was surprisingly named as a substitute for the game. The England midfielder came off the bench just after the hour-mark but was unable to find a winning goal for his side. Chelsea, who led through Joao Felix, staggered to a seventh Premier League draw of the campaign and their point leaves them ninth in the top-flight. The west Londoners could find themselves further down the division should Liverpool beat Everton on Monday night. So fans were extremely unhappy with Mount as he was seen laughing with West Ham star Emerson. As much as the 24-year-old is allowed to speak to opposition players, his happy demeanour does not reflect the mood at Stamford Bridge right now.

Performances aren't good enough and his attitude is becoming questionable as well.” Reflecting the view of Chelsea fans who want to see Mount sold, @Clinicalkai simply demanded: “SELL MICKEY MOUNT!” DON'T MISS...Man knocked out by one punch outside West Ham vs Chelsea clashRio Ferdinand details private chat with Graham Potter over Joao FelixChelsea's Boehly has caused 'difficult' transfer problem for Potter @Ibzsmo3k was also furious, tweeting: “I’m f***ing done man. We just dropped points? Mount is laughing. F*** off.” Opposition fans also took the incident as an opportunity to mock Chelsea. Sharing the image of Mount laughing, Arsenal supporter @PeakSanti joked: “Mason Mount is all rival fans right now.” That was not the only thing Mount did in his second-half cameo to anger fans. Despite the Blues feeling they should have won a penalty, supporters felt Mount cost them an extra two points by failing to set up Hakim Ziyech in added-time. Ziyech was free in the middle of the penalty area but Mount’s pass did not find the Moroccan. @Elsdawg tweeted: “Forget about the penalty we were robbed of, why didn’t Mount pass to Ziyech here.” Come the summer, Mount will have just 12 months remaining on his Chelsea contract. Discussions over a new deal have stalled, with the academy graduate seemingly not convinced about his future in Potter’s team. Liverpool have been linked with the Three Lions star. The Reds want to revamp their midfield in the summer and could target Mount alongside England team-mate Jude Bellingham.
