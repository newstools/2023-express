Happy Valley stars have taken to Instagram following the end of the series to give fans an insight into the filming of the show. James Norton, who plays Tommy Lee Royce, uploaded a picture alongside his co-lead actress Sarah Lancashire, who portrays Sergeant Catherine Cawood. The photo, which shows James wrapping an arm around his co-star, was simply captioned: “#happyvalley.” Ryan Cawood star Rhys Connah shared a carousel of snaps along with an emotional statement as he thanked creator Sally Wainwright for casting him. He wrote: “Nearly 10 years ago I started auditioning for the role (which is more than half my life). I have been honoured to be Ryan Cawood. “Thank you to #sallywainwright for trusting me with Ryan but most importantly for letting me grow to complete series three.” The final episode was watched by an average audience of 7.5 million, according to overnight ratings.
