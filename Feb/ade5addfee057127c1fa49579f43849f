An early morning helicopter raid resulted in the capture of a high ranking ISIS official named "Batar" in eastern Syria. The mission follows a similar raid last week which resulted in four US soldiers and a military dog being injured.   "Batar" is described as "an ISIS Syria Province Official involved in planning attacks on Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) guarded detention centres and manufacturing improvised explosive devices" in eastern Syria, according to a statement from US Central Command. No civilians or US soldiers were injured in the raid, according to the statement. It follows a similar operation on Thursday night, which led to the death of Hamza al-Homsi, another senior ISIS official. Four US military personnel and a dog were injured during the mission when an explosion was triggered.   Officials said US forces were "close to" al-Homsi when the blast occurred, resulting in his death, according to reporting by CNN. It is unclear whether the blast was caused by a suicide vest, booby trap or something else. The news comes as CENTCOM released a statement on Saturday night which said two rockets landed near a Coalition base named Green Village in northeast Syria. No Coalition forces were killed or injured as a result and no one has claimed responsibility, the statement read. US forces are investigating the incident.
