The Countdown legend undoubtedly turned heads at Alison Hammond's star-studded birthday party. The 62-year-old wowed in a cut-out khaki knit dress, which clung to her curves. Wearing her tresses down, the presenter accessorised with gold jewellery and added glitter to her face. She shared a number of snaps with her 307,000 Instagram followers, wowing in the tight ensemble. Carol Vorderman captioned her uploads: "BL**DY GOOD PARTY. Happy Birthday Kween @alisonhammond55. "And your Aidan #18. Having too good a night,"(sic) referencing Alison's teenage son.
