Former NFL player Stanley Wilson Jr. has died after reportedly collapsing ‘at a mental hospital’ earlier this month. According to TMZ, the 40-year-old - who played as a cornerback for the Detroit Lions between 2005 and 2007 - collapsed and died during intake at Metropolitan State Hospital in Los Angeles. According to sources cited by TMZ, the death is believed to not be linked to 'foul play’. Autopsy results, which may help determine the cause of the sudden collapse, are pending toxicology. Last year, Wilson was charged with two felony counts of vandalism and one count of second-degree burglary after he allegedly broke into a Hollywood Hills mansion on two separate occasions. The second time saw Wilson rtake a bath in an outdoor fountain after moving and damaging items in the home on August 24. His alleged outdoor bath reportedly caused $5,000 in damages. Wilson was arrested on both occasions and - after a stint behind bars - was ruled unfit to stand trial and as such was moved to the mental facility on February 1.
