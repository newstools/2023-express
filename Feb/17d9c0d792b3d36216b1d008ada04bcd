David Carrick will be sentenced this week after admitting 49 offences, including 24 counts of rape against 12 women. The former Metropolitan Police officer is expected to be handed a lengthy sentence after the force admitted he "should not have been a police officer". Since his admission, it emerged that Carrick faced numerous complaints about his behaviour throughout his career but no action was taken. Repeating an apology to his victims, Assistant Commissioner Barbara Gray said he "should not have been a police officer" saying the force "let them down".
