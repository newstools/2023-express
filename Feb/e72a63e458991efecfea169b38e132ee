NFL superstar quarterback Aaron Rodgers has completed his four-day darkness retreat after going into voluntary solitary confinement in an Oregon facility. The 39-year-old has openly stated that he would use the time to help make a decision over his NFL future, as well as giving himself "a better sense of where my life is at". In the facility, RodgersÂ was isolated in just 300 square feet of space, devoid of light, with a queen bed, a bathroom and a meditation-like mat on the floor - images have revealed. The legendary passer has been with the Packers his entire career, but now looks destined to move on after reports have emerged that the team are looking to give former first-round pick Jordan Love a chance to start. The Packers could also bring in a number of draft picks for Rodgers - likely the last year they'll be able to do so as he closes in on his 40's.  Although Rodgers signed a contract to remain with the Packers last year, he is able to be traded and would save the Packers some money against the cap, as they'd likely begin to rebuild their roster. Rodgers has been heavily linked with the Las Vegas Raiders, who waived their long-time starter Derek Carr in a telling move. The Raiders would be an ideal spot for Rodgers, after they traded for Davante Adams, who spent eight years in Green Bay being the quarterback's best receiver. Rodgers won back to back MVP awards in 2020 and 2021, but a disappointing 2022 season has seen the team question their ability to remain as contenders with the quarterback. Should the Raiders not make a move for him, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers could be a potential team to watch out for, after Tom Brady announced his retirement.
