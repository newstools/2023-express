The UK state pension age is 66 years old for both men and women but is due to increase to 67 between 2026 and 2028, and a further rise to 68 is set to occur shortly after, sooner than expected. Yet a new Express.co.uk poll has found that the state pension age should be 65 years old. The UK Government regularly reviews the state pension age under the Pensions Act 2014 to evaluate its appropriateness compared to the latest data including life expectancy. The age is timetabled to increase to 67 in the next three to five years, and again to 68 between 2044 and 2046. However, a second increase could happen up to 11 years sooner, with The Sun reporting that it could be changed to 68 as soon as 2035. A Department for Work and Pensions spokesperson recently told Express.co.uk: “No decision has been taken on changes to the state pension age. The Government is required by law to regularly review the state pension age and the second state pension age review is currently considering, based on a wide range of evidence including the latest life expectancy data and two independent reports, whether the rules around state pension age remain appropriate.” However, increases in the state pension age will force older Britons to change their retirement plans, with thousands having to work for longer than expected. The latest Government report is due to be published in May this year.

The second most common response was 60 years old with 30 per cent (514 people), followed by 62 years old with six per cent (100 people) and 66 years old with five per cent (87 people). A further five per cent (80 people) answered 63 years old, while four per cent (73 people) said it should be 70 years old and three per cent (43 people) said 64 years old.  In addition, two per cent of readers answered under 60, 67 years old and 68 years old respectively and other ages received less than one per cent. Just five people answered “other” and three people said they did not know. Dozens of comments were left below the accompanying article as readers shared their thoughts on the state pension age. Many argued that 65 was a suitable age for the state pension to begin. Username Yarm dave commented: “65 would be very realistic!” Similarly, username jc69 said: “65 would be a responsible age since life expectancy is reducing.” DON'T MISS: 'Millions of people missing out on £5,000' Benefits expert explains [ADVICE]State pension calculator shows when you can get it and the amount [SUPPORT]‘Nail in his coffin’ - Hiking state pension age to ‘destroy Sunak' [COMMENT] Another, username SpocksBeard, said: “As we all do different jobs it is hard to say. Office workers can carry on longer than engineering and construction workers. 65 seems fair.” And username JL77 added: “No later than 65.” However, other readers thought differently, with username BROX77 writing: “If you work in a heavy industry you should be able to retire at 60.” Likewise, username REVet said: “I think 50, but it wouldn't be sustainable so 65 would probably be better.” Yet, username 7985 thought it should be higher, commenting: “We can't afford pensioners the age must go up to at least 69.” While username Booo said: “They need to make allowances for employment type and health problems. One size fits all is not appropriate.”  The pension age is also set to increase in France from 62 to 64, with French President Emmanuel Macron facing nationwide strikes and protests over his pension reforms. Many European countries have a lower state pension age than the UK with both Poland and Austria having a retirement age of 60 for women and 65 for men. Belgium and Cyprus' retirement age is 65, while Portugal and Spain’s is 66. Germany’s official retirement age is 65 years and seven months, gradually increasing to 67 years by 2029. Only a few countries have a state pension age higher than the UK, Italy, Greece, and Denmark, where the state pension age is 67 years old.
