The Duke of Sussex hinted at a future return to the UK in a clip shared on Tuesday. Prince Harry filmed a video focused on one of his most beloved patronages, WellChild. Based in the UK, the organisation helps children and young people who need special care and support to be assisted at home rather than in hospital, whenever possible. In the video, the fifth-in-line to the throne expressed his admiration for those working with the charity, as well as the extraordinary children who every year are given a number of awards at the WellChild Awards ceremony for their exceptional qualities and fortitude. Referring to the next ceremony to take place later this year, the Duke said after asking people to nominate a person they deemed worthy of being acknowledged: "Each year, I so look forward to meeting with the Award winners and spreading awareness about this incredible charity. I hope this year you'll join me and get involved. Nominate someone today." WellChild is one of the organisations that received Harry's proceeds from his memoir, Spare, as a donation.
