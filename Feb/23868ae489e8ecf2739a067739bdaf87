Julia Fox, 33, flaunted her slim physique as she arrived in a skimpy crop top and low-cut jeans to the Diesel show at Milan Fashion Week. The model rocked an all-Diesel look, in a skimpy khaki bikini-style top, paired with light-wash jeans and matching denim heels. The Uncut Gems star layered the number with a khaki-coloured denim jacket and a small denim clutch bag. She was joined by her two-year-old son Valentino, who looked very stylish alongside his famous mum in double denim and a pin-striped waistcoat. In one picture, Julia posed under a red light, exposing her washboard abs and flawless makeup.
