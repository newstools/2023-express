In fact, the research, by easyJet Holidays, found that there has been an 83 percent surge in demand for solo trips on Valentine's Day since last year – showing that being single on February 14 doesn't have to be depressing. Spain is the most popular country for solo travellers, making up four of the top five dream destinations – including Costa Blanca, Lanzarote, and Majorca. And the Algarve in Portugal rounded out the top five list. Young adults aged under 23 years old are leading the solo travelling trend, with three-quarters (76 percent) of those holidaying alone falling within this age group. And those treating themselves to a trip say past experiences have put them off taking a romantic holiday with a partner – with 35 percent admitting it exposed cracks in the relationship. One in four (26 percent) claim they didn't get the holiday they wanted, and 30 percent say they didn't get to do things they enjoyed. However, despite the rise in demand for solo trips, 28 percent are held back by the cost of going it alone – as they are hit with the “single-person tax”. There's no doubt it costs more to be single, with travel experts revealing that solo travellers typically end up paying 90 percent more than couples – be it in rent, fuel, or food. In response to the rise in solo travel, easyJet Holidays is launching cheaper solo packages, dubbed “Solidays”, for Valentine’s Day, as well as offering a £100 discount for those going it alone. Paul Bixby, Commercial Director at easyJet Holidays, said: “It’s clear that there’s a rising trend in solo travel, which is why we’re showing some love to our single customers this Valentine’s Day – offering a special deal for those looking to plan a voyage of self-discovery, or just enjoy some well-earned me-time.” easyJet Holidays’ recommendations for the best “Solidays” to redeem the discount against can be found here.
