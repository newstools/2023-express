An emotional Volodymyr Zelensky had to fight back tears as he heard the cries of “Glory to Ukraine” shouted back at him during the beginning of his speech at the European Parliament on Thursday. As the President took to the stage, he uttered the phrase “Slava Ukraini!”, which translates to “Glory to Ukraine”. It has become a phrase symbolic of the fight against Russia, as much as Mr Zelensky himself has become the face of the resistance. As he shouted the phrase, a standing crowd of European members of Parliament then shouted the phrase back in a powerful moment that speaks to the unity of the West with Ukraine in the fight against Russia and Vladimir Putin. This is the longest known period Mr Zelensky has spent away from Ukraine since Russia first invaded. FOLLOW EXPRESS.CO.UK BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
