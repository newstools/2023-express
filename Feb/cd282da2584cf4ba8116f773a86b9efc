Alongside his Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, Mr Sunak has lowered inflation, despite it remaining high, and worked to increase growth and get public finances back on a sustainable path. Mr Sunak promised to clear up Tory sleaze but has still been faced with several issues. Last week Mr Sunak sacked his Party Chairman Nadhim Zahawi over his tax affairs after an independent investigation. Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab is also the subject of a formal investigation into bullying. He also pledged to unite the Conservative Party, but the latest Techne UK tracker poll of 1,624 voters on January 26 and 27 shows his party to trail by 21 points. Labour holds 47 per cent compared to the Conservative’s 26 per cent and Reform UK’s seven per cent. So what do YOU think? Is Mr Sunak doing well as Prime Minister?
