George Harrison died 22 years ago at just 58 after losing his battle with cancer and would have been 80-years-old on Saturday. Celebrating his incredible life and legacy, Sir Paul McCartney and Sir Ringo Starr paid tribute to the Quiet Beatle on social media, alongside his widow Olivia Harrison and only child Dhani Harrison. Sir Paul, who turned 80 last summer, posted a picture on Instagram of himself during a solo concert with an image of George and him playing guitar in a studio. Macca captioned the post: “Happy would’ve been to my mate @georgeharrisonofficial - Paul.” Meanwhile, Sir Ringo shared a black and white photo of himself with George and captioned it: “Happy 80 my friend, peace and love. I miss you man.” George’s widow Olivia Harrison, who he married in 1978, posted a picture of them as a couple and simply wrote: “George, February 25th 1943.” Their son Dhani Harrison, 44, wrote: “Happy George’s 80th to everyone out there. Bliss be upon you all.” His post featured a spiritual interview quote from his father.

That’s really what we’re supposed to be here for. And the difficult thing is we all go through our lives and our days and we don’t experience bliss. It’s a very subtle thing to experience that and to be able to know how to do that is something you don’t just stumble across. You have to search for it.” The Beatles star embraced Hinduism after finding fame empty. His final message to the world before his death was: "Everything else can wait, but the search for God cannot wait, and love one another."
