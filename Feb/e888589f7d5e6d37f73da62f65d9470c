Lancashire Police are holding a press conference this morning as their search continues for missing mother-of-two Nicola Bulley. The briefing, which aims to combat disinformation about her disappearance, is taking place 19 days after Ms Bulley vanished on January 27. The mortgage advisor disappeared while walking her springer spaniel Willow in the village of St Michael's on Wyre, Lancashire, after she dropped her two daughters - aged six and nine - at school. Since then, a lot of speculation about her disappearance has surfaced online, with the police urging members of the public to avoid taking the law into their own hands following reports that homes had been broken into in the area. At a press conference on February 3, the force first told the public of its "main working hypothesis" that the mortgage adviser fell in the river during a "10-minute window" between 9.10am and 9.20am that day. This has been hit with criticism from Ms Bulley's family members who said there is "no evidence" that she had fallen into the icy water. FOLLOW BELOW FOR UPDATES...
