It’s been a year and a half since Daniel Craig starred in his last James Bond movie No Time To Die. Since then there’s been little official news surrounding the next 007. Yet rumours have been abounding that Kick-Ass and Bullet Train star Aaron Taylor-Johnson has impressed producer Barbara Broccoli in secret auditions. The 32-year-old gave a coy response when asked about this last week, telling Vanity Fair: “It’s flattering. You can have something really positive [written about you], but you can also have something really negative that can circulate. You just want to stay in your lane, stay grounded, stay around the people that you love and love you back, and stay in that world. Because the moment you start believing the s*** people say about you, you’ve lost your f***ing mind. You’ve lost it.” And now Broccoli has given an update on where she’s at with the next Bond preparations, when caught on the BAFTAs red carpet last night. Speaking with LADBible, Broccoli said that despite all the rumours, EON Productions are much further back than at first thought. She said: “No, we haven’t even started casting yet. There isn’t even a script." The producer has previously said they decide what sort of tone and direction they want to take a Bond reboot before beginning auditions. The 007 boss has previously confirmed Craig’s replacement will be male but she’s open to actors of any ethnicity. Meanwhile, co-producer Michael G Wilson says they’re looking for someone in the thirties. Taylor-Johnson is 32 so he’d certainly be a good match. In the meantime, here’s the latest odds which should of course be taken with a pinch of salt.
