Meghan Markle and Prince Harry could be set for yet another bumper payday after they reportedly hired a big-time Hollywood deal-maker that could provide a huge boost to their careers after life in the Royal Family. The couple are understood to have been introduced to Adam Lilling by close friend Ellen DeGeneres. He was crowned one of Tinseltown’s top deal-makers and has worked with the entrepreneur for several years, Page Six reports. Meghan, Harry and Mr Lilling were seen in conversation at Ms DeGeneres’ surprise vow renewal to Portia de Rossi in the Duke and Duchess's home town of Montecito in California last week. The prince was spotted introducing him to a fellow guest. Mr Lilling and his business partner Amanda Groves were included in The Hollywood Reporter’s "Top deal-makers of 2022" in December, along with 43 other power players "who brokered big-ticket pacts, cultivated content and built brands from scratch amid the streaming wars". One industry expert who works with Mr Lilling told Page Six that he works at the “intersection of celebrity and venture investing", adding: "He has worked with Ellen forever, as well as Matthew McConaughey and a bunch of A-listers. It’s very possible that Ellen introduced him to Harry and Meghan." THIS IS A LIVE BLOG. FOLLOW BELOW FOR UPDATES:
