Zac Thompson, 11, died after drowning off West Angle Bay and suffering from a lack of oxygen to the brain. An inquest heard the boy, from Pembrokeshire was sitting with his brother and cousin on the rocks overlooking the bay when a large wave pulled them into the water. His brother and cousin reached dry land, while Za was pulled into the whirlpool. The inquest heard how the boys were planning to swim into the trepid waters. A passer-by helped Zac's brother and cousin pull him out the water, but he died a day later after being airlifted to hospital. Assistant coroner Mark Layton recorded a conclusion of accidental death at Haverfordwest. He said: "Despite their best efforts, Zac had sustained injuries from which he did not recover." Coroner's officer PC James Lang said that there was no evidence suggesting foul-play or third-party involvement. A tribute submitted by Carli Newell said: "Zac was a complete one of a kind. "He was funny, cheeky, kind, caring, courageous and a big ball of fun with mischief running through his bones. A water safety charity, Forever 11, has been set up in memory of Zac. Michele Thomas, Zac's head eacher at Pembroke Dock Community School, told the BBC: "Zac attended the school since he was two years old. "Even back then, he was a big character. "He was intelligent, caring, funny and sport mad. "We have always been very proud of Zac, he was an absolute star. "Zac had a warm heart and frequently spoke about the love he had for his family and friends. "He was a talented sportsman and has left a huge void in that year group, who will all remember him forever 11."
