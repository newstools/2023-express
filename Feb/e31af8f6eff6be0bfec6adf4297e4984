Police have appealed for witnesses after a woman was assaulted on board a bus in west London in what police believe was a religiously motivated attack - and have issued a CCTV image of a man they want to speak to about the incident. At about 11.30pm on November 27, 2022, the victim was on a Route 207 bus from Westfield Shopping Centre in White City when she was approached by a man who began speaking to her. The woman, aged in her 40s, was wearing a hijab and told the man she did not want to engage with him. He ignored her request and went on to make unwanted comments before assaulting her. She did not require hospital treatment after the incident. The man got off the bus on Uxbridge Road near to the town hall. A Met Police spokesman said: "Detectives from the Met's Roads and Transport Policing Command have carried out a number of enquiries, including a review of CCTV from the bus. "They are now appealing for the public's help to identify the suspect." Witnesses are being asked to call 101 quoting CAD 1753/27Nov22. To remain anonymous contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
