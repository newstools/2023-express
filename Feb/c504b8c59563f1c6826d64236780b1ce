Manchester United's future remains unclear as the takeover process continues, with the prospect of the Glazers maintaining control of the club seemingly growing. The Raine Group have received a third bid after Friday's soft deadline, which opens the door to Joel and Avram Glazer remaining at the helm. Qatari banker Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani and British businessman Sir Jim Ratcliffe have emerged as the two frontrunners to buy United after their offers and public pledges. But neither bid is thought to have met the Glazers' asking price worth between £6billion and £7bn, despite the club being valued at £5bn. And if the American owners' demands aren't satisfied, they could continue holding majority control at Old Trafford. A third bid from Elliott Investment Management could allow them to do just that, sparking fear among fans desperate for a change of power in M16. The process is far from concluded, though, and there are expected to be more waves of bidding in the coming weeks with the view of completing the process before Easter. Follow LIVE updates below...
