It’s been well over a year now since the last James Bond movie was released. Daniel Craig bowed out explosively in No Time To Die and now 007 producers will be busy planning the reboot with a new star for the first time in almost 20 years. Rumours abound of auditions and screen tests, especially for odds frontrunner Aaron Taylor-Johnson who is the favourite on 6-4 with Coral. However, he’s got hot competition as one star’s odds have slashed from 10-1 to 3-1. The star in question is Happy Valley’s James Norton, with Coral saying: “We are set for a tense finale of Happy Valley on Sunday evening, and as we approach that final episode, punters are backing villain James Norton to become the next James Bond.” Take it with a pinch of salt, but the 37-year-old certainly has the backing of many fans to take up the Licence to Kill next. Here are the full latest odds for the next Bond, which could be announced as soon as next month if rumours are to be believed.
