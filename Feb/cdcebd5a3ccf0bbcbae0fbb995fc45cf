Prince Harry and Meghan are likely to be subjected to "proper rigorous questioning", journalist Petronella Wyatt said while discussing the defamation case. This would be the "first time", the British media personality went on to claim, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have undergone a "proper grilling", as they have so far been interviewed only by "their hand-picked friends in the media". Appearing on GB News, Ms Wyatt claimed: "Nobody has challenged them, they had a terribly easy ride and I do think, because a lot of the people they are making accusations against obviously can't answer back because some of them are members of the Royal Family, it's time that they were subjected to a proper grilling, because they have been going on and on for years." Earlier this week, it was revealed judge Charlene Edwards Honeywell rejected a bid to stop Meghan and Harry from having to give evidence in a legal deposition as part of Miss Markle's defamation case. Which means that, if the case goes ahead, the Sussexes may need to give legal deposition under oath. However, the judge said a "preliminary peek" suggested some of the claims "may be ripe for dismissal". In her civil case, Miss Markle alleged, among other things, that Meghan falsely and maliciously stated" she was "an only child" when she was interviewed by Oprah Winfrey in early 2021. The Duchess is also accused of misrepresenting the relationship she had with Miss Markle while growing up. Meghan's legal team said in response that this is a "vague and ambiguous" request and "not relevant to any party's claim or defence". The Duchess' lawyers also said, in response to the claim Meghan was not an only child, that "a statement that she grew up or did not grow up as an 'only child' cannot be defamatory as a matter of law". They argue that a comment about an only child "does not distinguish between biological relations, on the one hand, and the manner in which a child was raised, on the other".
