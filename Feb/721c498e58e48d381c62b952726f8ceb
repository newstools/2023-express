Prince Harry and Meghan have not yet decided whether they will attend King Charles's Coronation, sources close to the couple have claimed. As revealed earlier this month by Express.co.uk, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are on the list of people set to receive an invitation to attend the historic event on May 6. But the couple is reportedly waiting to see what type of welcome they could get if they travel across the pond. To this end, the Duke is understood to want a summit with Prince William and King Charles prior to a possible trip to the UK. A source told the Mirror: "Harry has been very clear and his position hasn’t wavered – he isn’t going to come if he feels the atmosphere will be as toxic as it was during the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee and funeral. "He’s said he wants to reconcile with his family and it’s their call, but so far nothing has changed." FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES…
