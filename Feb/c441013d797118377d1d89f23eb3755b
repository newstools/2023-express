A new mum has told of her astonishment after heartless thieves stole her car from hospital parking as she was on a labour ward. Caroline Evans was admitted on February 1 and was ready to give birth.   However, when her husband David needed to collect some items from their home, he could not find his wife's car where it had been left in hospital parking,Â reports Coventry Live. The 30-year-old said this was her first car and she had a vision of "coming home as a three in the car". She said the car must have been stolen while she was induced on the labour ward at University Hospital Coventry. Speaking to the BBC, Caroline, from Rugby, said: "It was my first car when I got my first full-time job. I went 'I'm gonna have something that's a real, real treat for me." Recalling the moment she was told the car had disappeared, she said: "I thought this is weird - is my husband just being a numpty and just can't literally locate it? "I couldn't quite believe what I was actually hearing and then disbelief when you go down to security whilst you're having mild contractions trying to file a report." West Midlands Police said a car was stolen from Clifford Bridge Road between 3pm and 7pm on February 1. Caroline said her husband found part of the vehicle lock in the car park which the Hospital Trust say is covered by CCTV cameras. She said: "We were very fortunate in that we've got family around us, so actually it was more of an inconvenience around getting home rather than it only being our lifeline." A spokesman from the Hospital Trust said security monitor the car park every day. They said: "Security officers monitor our car parks 24 hours a day, seven days a week and we have further stepped up the number of patrols following this incident. "We would continue to ask all staff and visitors to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity to our security team."
