Rihanna performed at the Super Bowl LVII half-time show on Sunday night, but the opening song and the stage production had fans fearing for her safety. Rihanna performed the opening song while on a floating stage seemingly only supported by a few cords. The global music superstar was making her return to live performing with the Super Bowl show, and didn't disappoint. Her first song, 'Better Have My Money', was performed while shje was suepended at least 30 feet in the air on a floating stage. While Rihanna was strapped onto the stage with a harness, some fans were concerned and compared the sight to an infamous scene in the Netflix show 'Squid Game'. In the scene in question, contestants have to cross from one platform to another over two ladders. However, in the gruesome scene, the glass flooring of half of the ladder panels fall underneath contestants when they are stepped on. Luckily for Rihanna, however, the stages in her performance were kept stationary with harnesses. That didn't stop fans from joking on social media, with one writing: "Rihanna looking like she’s ready for Squid games," while another wrote: "Very brave of Rihanna to do the halftime show on the Squid Game bridge." One fan joked: "It was nice of Squid Game to loan out their stages to Rihanna for this halftime show." "Rihanna’s stage giving me major Squid Game vibes," one fan wrote. Rihanna was heavily rumoured to bring out a special guest for her show, but instead chose to keep it as a solo performance. Her show was well received on social media, with some praising it as the greatest half-time show performance ever. One fan wrote: "Honestly that could be the best halftime performance I’ve ever seen. Rihanna gave me chills," while another posted: "Best halftime performance ever. Rihanna is such a Queen."
