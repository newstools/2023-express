Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are reportedly moving away from producing content centred on themselves. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's next step in their careers as video producers for US streaming platform Netflix will include "fun" television series, it has been claimed. A source told the Telegraph: "There will be more of a heavy focus on fictional, scripted content. It will be rom coms, feel good and light-hearted programmes." The Sussexes signed a multi-year deal with Netflix in 2020, only weeks after they officially stepped down as full-time working members of the Firm and relocated to California. In late 2022, they launched their first two products: Harry and Meghan, a biographical six-part docu-series entirely focused on their romance and struggles with the media and the Firm, and Live to Lead, a documentary series featuring interviews with world leaders and leading personalities such as feminist Gloria Steinem and former New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern. In Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex launched a series of blistering allegations and attacks against the Royal Family. Among the potentially damaging claims for the Firm included in the programme, it was alleged the communications offices of other members of the Firm briefed the media against the Sussexes. Prince Harry also alleged the Palace released in January 2020 a statement in both his and Prince William's name quashing allegations the Prince of Wales had driven out of the Firm the Sussexes. The Duke claimed no one had spoken to him about that message nor asked him if he wanted to issue it. Neither Buckingham Palace nor Kensington Palace commented on the claims made by the Sussexes in their docu-series. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATESâ€¦
