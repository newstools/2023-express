At least one sailor has been hospitalised after the drinking water on board a Royal Navy ship has been contaminated. The type 23 frigate, HMS Portland, was diverted to Portsmouth on Friday following "an issue with one of the ship's freshwater systems". An unnamed sailor was rushed to Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth with symptoms. A Navy source confirmed that the "poisoning" of the water happened after the wrong chemicals were put into it. The error was then flagged by the individual, and sources praised them last night for their "integrity" in coming forwards which "reduced the consequences". A source told The Telegraph: "The individual made a mistake and informed their chain of command. It's really unfortunate, and their integrity should be acknowledged." A Royal Navy spokesman said: "We can confirm that HMS Portland has returned to HMNB Portsmouth as a precautionary measure, following an issue with one of the ship’s freshwater systems. "The health and safety of our personnel is of the utmost importance and we are taking a number of measures to safeguard the ship’s company whilst the issue is investigated." It is, as of yet, unclear what substance the water was contaminated with. A source told Mailonline: "The situation is quite serious. "The ship has done everything they should do. They found out about it this morning and came alongside in Portsmouth. "They have got scientists on board investigating. The water has been contaminated by something. A number of personnel have been taken to Queen Alexandra Hospital for treatment." HMS Portland departed from its home port at Plymouth on Saturday, January 7. It comes just weeks after the Royal Navy announced a Russian warship armed with hypersonic missiles is being tracked by HMS Portland. The Admiral Gorshkov is the first Russian vessel armed with hypersonic weapons and was sailing “close to the UK” through the North Sea.
