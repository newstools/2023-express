The spiky superstar is one of pop's biggest success stories with her global album sales topping 60 million and 21 UK Top 10 singles. She calls her career "the longest fluke in history" - a joke soundly undermined by her ninth full-length release.  Belters include the euphoric title track, an infectious synth-heavy explosion of energy - co-written by Snow Patrol's Johnny McDaid - about finding real love. The kind that means if you fall backwards, you can trust your other half to catch you. "Go where love is on our side," she sings over the pulsing dance-pop beat. "It's a trust fall, baby." Pink's powerhouse vocals, a thing of wonder, are properly showcased on heartfelt opener When I Get There with that distinctive, raspy voice ringing out over a sombre, repeated keyboard note. The 'there' is heaven - she is singing to someone she has loved and lost. Her father? It's quite beautiful. The bittersweet relationship song Turbulence has a jauntier vibe. "Panic is temporary but I'll be permanent," she pledges. Quality guest artists abound.  Alt-folk band The Lumineers join her on the plaintive Long Way To Go. Swedish folk duo First Aid Kit enhance nostalgic Kids In Love, and the superb Chris Stapleton guests on tear-stained country number Just Say I'm Sorry. Pink's at her poppiest on Never Gonna Not Dance Again, a carefree Latin-flavoured floor filler. Runaway ups the tempo, Hate Me is catchy and defiant, Last Call is an apocalyptic foot tapper - "Last call before the world ends". Let's hope not. Quirky, smart and versatile, Pink remains a major talent. It's no fluke.
