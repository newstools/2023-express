Higher earners in England are set to pay more to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and lose their Personal Savings Allowance. Anyone earnings over £125,140 a year is set to be levied with a 45 percent tax charge come April. Last year, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt announced a wave of tax changes as part of his Autumn Statement. One of the most controversial proposals was the reduction of the additional-rate income tax threshold. As of April 6, 2023, this tax rate will drop from £150,000 to £125,140 with around 250,000 taxpayers to be pushed into a higher band band. With this decision, those affected with end up paying 45 percent tax on any income above the new threshold Mr Hunt said lowering the additional-rate means someone earning £150,000 will pay an extra £1,200 income tax per year.

She explained: “A whole cohort of higher earners will shortly lose their Personal Savings Allowance altogether, as the threshold for paying the 45 percent income tax band is about to drop from £150,000 to £125,140 in April. “This makes it imperative to hunt out more tax-efficient options for savings such as ISAs or transferring savings to a spouse if they are subject to a lower tax band.” The finance expert shared the options available to people seeking to avoid this 45 percent charge on income tax. Ms Haine added: “While an easy-access savings account makes sense for an emergency fund to cover life’s unexpected expenses, those with longer-term savings goals – more than five years and ideally at least 10 – might want to consider an investment ISA that protects their money from tax. “While higher returns from the markets can never be guaranteed, a long-term approach allows a diversified investment portfolio to absorb the highs as well as the lows and potentially deliver inflation-beating growth. “Plus, with the end of the tax year looming and a less attractive tax environment from April 6, maximising a £20,000 tax-free ISA allowance makes sense to reduce income tax liabilities further down the line.” It should be noted that the other rates for tax bands will remain unchanged despite Mr Hunt’s alteration to the additional rate.

For lower earners, the basic rate of tax will stay at 20 percent on any amount between £12,570 to £50,271. In comparison, higher earners will see a 40 percent tax charge on any money made between £50,271 to £150,000. According to the Draft Welsh Budget, taxpayers in Wales will pay the same amount of income tax as those in England and Northern Ireland from April 2023. However, those living in Scotland will see the income tax rates increase for higher earners in the country. As part of the Scottish Budget, the higher rate of tax will rise from 41 to 42 percent in the pound, with the highest top rate going up from 46 to 47 percent. The threshold for Scotland's top rate of tax will be reduced to £125,140, which aligns the additional-rate tax band in the rest of the UK. Similar to England, the personal allowance and other income tax bands will remain frozen for this year.
