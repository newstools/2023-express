A lookalike White House is up for sale for a staggering £7million ($8,415,820). The five-bedroom, 11-bathroom luxury property features towering columns, a circular front facade and the US national flag standing proud next to it. An elegant dining room adds to the the Presidential finish - but no feature is more fitting than the replica Oval Office. It is located 730 miles away from Washington DC in Evansville, a city of around 120,000, in Indiana. Berkshire Hathaway Homes listed the home for an eye-watering $8.5million, describing it as a “single family” property.

Another user called it “eye-bleedingly tacky”, adding: “If this were the White House, I'd renounce my citizenship.” "Not sure anyone else will want to spend that much money to live in Evansville, Indiana," another user said.

It has 13 bedrooms, 35 bathrooms and sits on 18 acres.
