A teenager has made headlines after securing an investment from entrepreneur Steven Bartlett when he appeared as the youngest solo pitcher ever on Dragons' Den. A university dropout, the teen appeared on the hit BBC One show on Thursday, February 2, and received a £35,000 investment in return for a 35 per cent stake in his business which makes personalised bank cards. Speaking to the Manchester Evening News, Myles Dickinson said that Mr Bartlett had been his first choice. The teenager founded Haze Customisation in Manchester in October 2021 while studying at The London Institute of Banking and Finance. He dropped out in August 2022 and went on to co-found Blatant Skin in Manchester this month with entrepreneur Johnny Lye.  Writing on LinkedIn before the episode was aired, Myles said: "Bringing an exciting business to the show, whilst also being the youngest person to ever go on alone at 18. It wasn’t easy but I hope me going on the show inspires more young entrepreneurs to start their own businesses." Speaking later to the Manchester Evening News, Mr Dickinson, now 19, said Haze Customisation was born out of a university project and initially funded by his student loan. After purchasing laser engravers from China, and experimenting with transferring data from bank cards, the budding entrepreneur is now able to let customers create their own personalised credit cards.  Mr Dickinson said: "It was exam season at the time the show was being filmed so it was full on. I headed up to Salford and it only hit me when I entered the waiting room before hand that it was real. "For a few reasons my final pitch wasn't actually ready until just before filming started which made me extra nervous. Steven Bartlett was my first choice of backer and I'm so excited to be working with him."
