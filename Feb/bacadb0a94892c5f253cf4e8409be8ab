On Sunday night, Dancing on Ice viewers tuned in to watch the remaining eight contestants tackle icon’s week. However, when hosts Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby were about to introduce comedian Darren Harriott, Holly couldn’t help but have a jibe at her friend's age. Week five of the ITV show saw the line-up tackle huge hits from some of the biggest musical icons from across the decades.Dancing on Ice viewers saw the likes of Joey Essex skate to Elton John, Nile Wilson to Robbie Williams, Patsy Palmer to the Spice Girls and Mollie Gallagher to Billie Eilish.With the competition heating up with the celebrities improving each week, the two hosts reiterated the importance of the public voting to save their favourite contestant.Phil commented that the line-up was in need of star quality this week as somebody would be going home later on in the same show.

But-”Phil quickly interjected: “Shut your face! It’s Darren and Tippy” Although, Holly seemed taken aback by his outburst as she visibly jumped when he demanded her to quiet as she mimed to the live audience she was zipping her mouth.Holly, who is 42 years old, was born at the start of the 80s whereas Phil was born in 1962 and would have a clear recollection of what the era was like.However, the exchange between the two friends seemed to be in good humour as the live crowd giggled and they laughed the ageing probe over before Darren took to the ice.The comedian and his partner Tippy performed a routine to the classic 80s hit - I'm Your Man by Wham.
