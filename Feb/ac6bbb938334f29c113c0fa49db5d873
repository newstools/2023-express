Amanda Holden, 52, arrived at the Superdrug Presents event at London's Old Truman Brewery dressed to impress. She flaunted a figure more often seen on women half her age, as she donned a coral-coloured two-piece outfit which bared her waist and toned abs. Meanwhile, her skirt featured a dramatic slit up the front and was paired with patent rose gold heels to complete the look. Slinging a matching cape over her shoulders, she looked the picture of perfection at the festival, which has been offering free Beauty Studio treatments and interactions with the nation's favourite beauty influencers. The action kicks off today, but Amanda worked the red carpet yesterday in preparation for the event, channelling effortless glam for the wowed onlookers around her.
