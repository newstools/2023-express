Prince Harry may appear alone at King Charles' Coronation, sources have claimed. One of the working theories reportedly devised to include the Duke and Duchess of Sussex at the sacred event has been dubbed "Harry in a hurry". According to this plan, Harry would attend the event by flying in and out of Britain within 48 hours on Coronation weekend. This theory would see Harry joining thousands more guests at Westminster Abbey for the first Coronation in seven decades while Meghan remained at home with their two children - Archie Harrison and Lilibet 'Lili' Diana. But this working theory, published by the Mail on Sunday, implies the Duke missing the fourth birthday of his son, celebrated the same day of the Coronation. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATESâ€¦
