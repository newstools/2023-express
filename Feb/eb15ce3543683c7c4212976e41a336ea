Hollywood superstar Ryan Reynolds and Always Sunny in Philadelphia creator Rob McElhenney will suit up in Wrexham AFC colours this summer to take part in a 7v7 tournament in the United States. A new format named 'The Soccer Tournament' will see Wrexham AFC take part beginning this June. Reynolds and McElhenney have been named in the squad to take part in the tournament alongside some legends of the club in Paul Rutherford, Mark Carrington, Shaun Pearson and David Jones. The tournament will see 32 teams go head-to-head for the title, with British esports and non-league club Hashtag United also take part, meanwhile Premier League legend Clint Dempsey will also field his own team. Reynolds and McElhenney will be seen playing the sport for the first time since they took over as owners of the club two years ago, when they admittedly knew very little about football. Reynolds and McElhenney have become beloved figures in the Welsh city since their takeover, guiding the team to a playoff run last season and looking to secure automatic promotion this year. They have seemingly fallen in love with the sport since joining the club as owners, reguarly visiting the ground with Reynolds being seen very emotional in a number of games. The tournament will see them pull on the jersey themselves for the first time though, playing a sport in which neither have played much in their lives. In a statement, Wrexham advisor Shaun Harvey explained: "We look forward to debuting in the US with a legends team and the ambition of winning the tournament. "Should we be successful, $500,000 of the prize money will be used to enhance the club's work in the local community. Wrexham AFC is more than just a first team. It represents the people of North Wales and this tournament will allow us to incorporate former players of the club like we have never been able to do before."
