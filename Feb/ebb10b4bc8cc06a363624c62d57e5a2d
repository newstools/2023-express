Prince Harry and Meghan were spotted celebrating the vow renewal of Ellen Degeneres and her wife, Portia De Rossi. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were among the host of high-profile guests present with Kris Jenner officiating the vow renewals. The couple have stayed out of the public eye since their last public appearance in New York for the Ripple of Hope Awards in December. This bombshell book, as well as Harry's host of interviews to coincide with the release on January 10, have resulted in a sharp decline in the couple's popularity.

Ellen and Portia are among the couple's famous neighbours. FOLLOW BELOW FOR THE LATEST ROYAL UPDATES...
