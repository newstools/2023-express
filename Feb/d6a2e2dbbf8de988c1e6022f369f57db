During the Wessexes' tour of the Cayman Islands, yesterday, February 21, Sophie visited the YMCA Field of Dreams, where she met local community volunteers. She also joined children in taking part in activities, including ice cream making and archery. For the occasion, Sophie opted for white dress with a blue, gold, and black pattern. It featured three-quarter sleeves and had a flowing skirt that reached the Countess' knees. Called the Cotton Patterned Midi Dress in Light Blue, the garment was by Italian designer Etro. The dress is a new addition to Sophie's wardrobe and costs a huge £1,350 at Selfridges.  Sophie matched her dress with a pair of white flats, which were the Cream Leather Pointed Pumps by Nicola Sexton. These are still available to buy on the designer's website and cost £175. As for accessories, Sophie donned a few gold pieces of jewellery. She wore a gold necklace with a turquoise-coloured stone, as well as dangling gold earrings, which also features the turquoise stones.  Sophie's hair was styled in a simple low ponytail and she wore minimal make-up. Royal watchers were quick to comment on her outfit, with many praising it.
