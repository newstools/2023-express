Maya Jama, 28, set pulses racing with a new series of pictures that flaunted her taut stomach on social media. The Love Island star took to Instagram yesterday to share a carousel of photos from recent events following her huge success as the ITV show’s new host. In view of her 2.7 million followers, Maya put her fabulous curves on display in a stylish outfit consisting of a white crop top and a low-waisted maxi skirt. In the snaps, Maya could be seen tucking into some McDonald’s fries and smiling for the camera while posing with friends. She also included some pictures wearing a jaw-dropping black sequined jumpsuit that cinched at the waist, highlighting her trim figure.
