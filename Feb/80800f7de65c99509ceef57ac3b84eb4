President Zelensky refused to give any territory to Vladimir Putin in a potential peace deal, saying: “Weapons are the only language Russia understands.” In an interview marking a year since Moscow’s invasion, Ukraine’s leader warned that conceding land meant Russia could “keep coming back”. However, he said Western military hardware would bring peace closer. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer pledged total support before he and Mr Zelensky met in Kyiv for the first time. Mr Zelensky said Putin’s predicted spring offensive had already begun but believed Ukraine’s forces could keep resisting the advance ­until they were able to launch a counter-offensive. Repeating his calls for more military aid from the West, he told the BBC: “Of course, modern weapons speed up peace. Weapons are the only language Russia understands.” He also addressed a threat by Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko to wage war alongside Russian troops from his territory if a Ukrainian soldier crossed the border. Mr Zelensky said: “I hope Belarus won’t join [the war]. If it does, we will fight and we will survive.” He warned that allowing Russia to use Belarus as a staging post for an attack for a second time would be a “huge mistake”. Mr Zelensky also described Moscow’s tactics in the war as “valueless”. Before his meeting with President Zelensky, Sir Keir said: “Should there be an election next year and a change of government, the position on Ukraine will remain the same. “It’s very important for me to be here with the people, making it clear that support for Ukraine in the United Kingdom is united.” Sir Keir also visited Irpin and Bucha, regions scarred by heavy fighting.
