When asked if some states had the right to leave the 247-year-old Union, South Carolina's former Governor said: "I think that they do, I mean the Constitution says that."

"See, Texas v White, 74 U.S. (7 Wall) 700 (1869). See also, The Civil War." However, when asked if she would countenance the Palmetto State's secession, Haley added: "I'm one of those people that doesn't think it's going to get to that point and let me tell you why.

Haley officially launched her 2024 bid yesterday in a clip uploaded to social media. The former Palmetto State Governor previously said she would not take on Donald Trump if he entered the race.
