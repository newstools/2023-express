Yorkshire-based investigative series Happy Valley has returned to our screens for a third series after a seven-year wait. The finale will air on BBC One on Sunday, February 5, but do you think there should be a fourth series? Vote in our poll. The crime drama sees Sarah Lancashire return as sergeant Catherine Cawood as she nears retirement and continues to tackle a series of brutal murders, while her grandson Ryan Cawood, played by Rhys Connah, is now 16 and able to make his own decisions in life. Creator Sally Wainwright previously said after the second series aired that the popular drama “would only return once more”. More recently, she told Radio Times magazine that they had made a “definite decision that this was going to be the final season”. She explained: “Just because it’s been successful, we weren’t going to let it drift on until it became a pale shadow of itself.” READ MORE: Happy Valley star teases 'more to come' and final season 'felt right' Similarly, at a BFI screening for the premiere of the third series last December, executive producer Will Johnston hinted that this would be the conclusion of the show. He said: “It definitely isn't coming back – and again this is [from] Sally and Sarah who completely and rightly feel that you can have too much of a good thing.” He continued: “We're really not doing any more. You're a few weeks away from the ending but when you get to it, I really hope you'll feel content that if that's the last you ever see of the characters of Happy Valley, it was a big way to go out.” So what do YOU think? Should Happy Valley come to an end or continue? Vote in our poll and leave your thoughts in the comment section below.
