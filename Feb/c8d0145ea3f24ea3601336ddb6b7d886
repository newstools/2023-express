Joan Collins, 89, was all smiles as she was pictured at the prestigious Los Angeles restaurant Craigs alongside her husband, Percy Gibson, 58. The Hollywood star went for an all-black ensemble, consisting of an oversized black flowing coat, with a black top and pointed heels. She went for her usual glamorous makeup look, with a sultry red lip and smokey eyes as she walked hand in hand with Percy. Joan accessorised with a bold statement necklace, a clutch purse and dangly earrings. Percy, meanwhile, looked dapper in a light brown blazer, paired with grey pants and black shoes.
