Excitement is reaching fever pitch at the 02 as fans prepare for the action at the 2023 Brit Awards - and 24-year-old Tallia Storm sent jaws dropping to the floor as she made an early red carpet appearance ahead of the event. Tallia was equally early when she launched herself onto the music scene, thanks to the support of Elton John, who invited her to open one of his concerts when she was aged just 13. After hearing her first demo tape, he declared her voice "one of the most impressive soul signatures I've heard in 20 years" - and her star has continued to rise ever since. Now in her 20s, the pop sensation ensured all eyes were on her this evening as she donned an eye-popping all-pink ensemble. Already renowned for leaving little to the imagination, Tallia lived up to her signature sense of raunchy style on Saturday when she stepped out in skimpy candy pink lingerie with a matching pink furry coat slung wide open.
