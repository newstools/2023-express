Alongside the snap shared on Sunday, Simon wrote: “Nice to meet up for lunch with some old friends today.” Their reunion comes decades after the trio presented together on BBC's legendary show Blue Peter. Simon and Matt presented the children's TV programme from 1999 until 2005, while Konnie is the third-longest serving presenter after presenting it from 1997 until 2008. Fans rushed to comment on the photo as many gushed over the trio's ageless appearance. Tanya wrote: "A photo of loveliness. None of you have aged!" Kevin agreed: "You're all looking well," while cheeky quizzed: "Does Konnie Huq age?"
