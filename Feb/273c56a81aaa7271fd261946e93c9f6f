As you can read in our full Galaxy S23 Ultra review, this latest device from Samsung is definitely the phone to beat in 2023. With a fabulous camera, speedy processor and the unique S Pen tucked inside its shell there's very little else on the market that comes close to matching its features but there is one sticking point... the price. The S23 Ultra starts from a very hefty £1,245 and those adding more internal storage could find themselves facing a bill of over £1,500 - ouch! It's a lot of money for a smartphone but Samsung is trying to soften the blow thanks to its trade-in deals and a new code that offers an instant discount. In fact, some Samsung Galaxy phone owners could find they can slash the price of a new S23 Ultra by as much as £750. That makes things way more affordable, especially as you can also spread the cost over 36 months without paying any interest. If that sounds enticing then the first thing you'll need to do is head to Samsung's store and pop an S23 Ultra in your shopping basket. You'll then be asked if you have a current Galaxy - or another smartphone brand such as Apple, Oppo or Xiaomi - that you wish to trade in. Once you've added your current device there's then the option to add the code S23BOOST which applies a further £150 discount. With Samsung offering £600 trade-in values on devices such as the S22 Ultra it's possible to reduce the S23 Ultra by over £700.
