Conor McGregor's return to the UFC has been confirmed, with The Notorious set to take on fellow lightweight Michael Chandler. The two UFC stars will coach teams in The Ultimate Fighter before going head-to-head.    He has only won once in the UFC since then, however, and has suffered defeats against Poirier, Charles Oliveira and Justin Gaethje in the process. Chandler will likely view McGregor as the ideal chance to propel himself back into the mix for a title shot with a win. Before fighting, both will work as coaches on the reality series 'The Ultimate Fighter'. They will train a number of young fighters in a knockout team tournament, which will run from May 30 to August 15. There is no date set for McGregor and Chandler to meet in the octagon just yet, but White confirmed on Saturday that they will fight before the end of the year. McGregor's coach John Kavanagh indicated last week that the decision to join 'TUF' was made to allow McGregor to fully immerse himself in the sport again before fighting himself.
