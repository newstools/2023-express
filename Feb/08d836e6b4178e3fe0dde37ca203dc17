Dinnerladies star Maxine Peake is battling to stop a historic theatre from being demolished and turned into flats. The actress – known for roles in TV blockbusters Shameless and Silk – has joined campaigners fighting to save Oldham Coliseum.  The final curtain will fall on the 135-year-old North-west venue next month after it lost its £600,000 Arts Council England funding. Maxine, 48, told a public meeting the Coliseum was “the lifeblood of its community”. She said the “vital, vibrant, institution has an amazing history and if we can keep it alive it will have an amazing future”. A new £24million theatre will not open until 2026, leaving a “vacuum of arts access” for three years, according to actors union Equity. It would have been a new home for the Coliseum before its funding was axed. Coliseum boss Chris Lawson warned “time is running out”.   Amanda Chadderton, the leader of Oldham Council, insisted the Coliseum was not fit for purpose and was “riddled with asbestos”. She said the new site – with a 300-seat auditorium and 120-seat studio space – would add to the “buzz” of the town centre and create jobs. The council say £1.85million of Arts Council funds will provide cultural activities in the area while the theatre is built. Past stars to play the Coliseum include Coronation Street actors Jean Alexander (Hilda Ogden) and William Roache (Ken Barlow).
