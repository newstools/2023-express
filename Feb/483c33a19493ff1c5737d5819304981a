A 69-year-old woman stands accused of keeping her mother's dead body in a freezer for almost two years. Eva Bratcher appeared in court in the US on Thursday facing charges of concealing her 96-year-old mother’s death and possessing a fraudulent identification card. Regina Michalski’s body was discovered this week in a freezer in the garage near the apartment they had shared in Chicago, police said. Investigators believe she died in March 2021. The cause won’t be determined until the body is thawed. The allegations are “very disturbing,” Judge David Kelly said while setting a $20,000 bond for Ms Bratcher. Judge Kelly turned down a defence lawyer’s request for a lower bond to have Ms Bratcher released from custody.
