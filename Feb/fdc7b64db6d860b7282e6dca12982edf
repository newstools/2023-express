Geri Horner, 50, and Lily James, 33, led stars amping up the glamour at this year's BAFTA Awards in London. Spice Girl Geri arrived with her dapper husband, F1 boss Christian Horner, but the singer stole the show in her elegant white satin dress, complete with a plunging neckline. Pam and Tommy actress Lily followed suit, as she also dressed in white with a racy low-cut design, featuring an opulent pearl-encrusted cage. Bond Girl Ana de Armas also opted for a satin look, stunning onlookers in a blush pink gown, emulating bombshell Marilyn Monroe, who she portrayed in BAFTA nominated Netflix film, Blonde. The BAFTAs are taking place at Southbank Centre's Royal Festival Hall this evening, with All Quiet On The Western Front, The Banshees Of Inisherin, Everything Everywhere All At Once, Elvis and Tar receiving the most nominations.
