Prince Harry has seen his popularity in the US take another blow as Prince William secured a strong lead on his brother in a new survey. A poll by Redfield & Wilton asked respondents to rate which brother better embodied loyalty, duty or trustworthiness and five other characteristics. The Prince of Wales emerged on top in five of the categories, with Prince Harry coming second to his brother on key royal traits. Of the 1,500 participants in the survey, 43 percent said Prince William better upheld the concept of duty so dear to the monarchy. The Duke of Sussex himself appeared to struggle with his duty as a royal, criticising William for his refusal to set aside his role as heir to the throne even during personal arguments. Writing in his book Spare about a spat with the Prince of Wales about Meghan Markle, Harry wrote: "He was in full Heir mode, and couldn't fathom why I wasn't dutifully playing the role of the Spare." The Redfield & Wilton poll saw William secure a 17-point lead over Prince Harry on leadership, a blow for the Duke as he has increasingly tried to emerge himself as a leader and advocate.

Poll respondents also said the Duke of Sussex had shown more effort to bridge the gap with the Royal Family compared to Prince William. While the Prince of Wales has adopted the family motto of "never complain, never explain", Harry has insisted he is eager to get his brother and father "back". He is also believed to be pushing for a private meeting with the King ahead of his Coronation to discuss their differences. The survey did also bring the brothers together in the last question of the poll, where William and Harry were tied to 31 percent each when participants were asked whether the brothers were a "positive force for change."
