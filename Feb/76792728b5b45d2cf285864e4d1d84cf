Trying new beauty products doesn't have to break the bank, and Amazon has been expanding its range of beauty products, including launching discounts on top selling products. Maybelline is an affordable brand with a huge range of beauty, including many products which come in at below the £15 mark.    The mascara has thousands of five star reviews, with some calling the product 'the best mascara ever'. Mrs Biggs said: ''Really impressed by this mascara. My lashes are very short and light coloured - this mascara gave me visibly longer lashes and the fibres in the product meant it stayed on well, little smudging even in bad winter weather! It does take a little effort to remove but that’s to be expected when it stays on so long and so well. Totally worth the money and I’d buy again.'' Lina commented: ''Honestly the best mascara ever, my lashes looks amazing long and wide, it doesn't leave excessive product on your eyelashes. 10/10!'' Amanda also added: ''This is the best mascara I have ever owned, it makes my lashes look amazing and definitely no smudges, I have terribly hooded eyes so smudging is a real problem, not with this little treasure. Huge thumbs up from me.''
