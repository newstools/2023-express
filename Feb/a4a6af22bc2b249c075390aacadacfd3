Dame Helen Mirren looked ageless as she donned a glamorous floor-length gown which highlighted her toned and lean physique. The fitted black dress featured a low-cut neckline as she posed for pictures at the Golda premiere. The 77-year-old looked totally different from her usual sleek updo and instead opted to wear her long locks loose as they cascaded down past her shoulders. Dame Helen's long-sleeved frock featured a ruffled design on the shoulders and was gathered across the neckline. She wore a pair of black high-heeled shoes to add a few inches to elongate her long legs and opted for a glamorous look with her make-up, including a bold red lip.
