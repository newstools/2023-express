Maya Jama, 28, put her amazing curves on display as she donned a tiny black bikini to make the most of her stay in South Africa. The Love Island presenter took to Instagram to share an update with her fans ahead of tonight’s double-dumping in the famous ITV villa. Maya shared a video to her story of herself lip-syncing to a background song while modelling her triangle bikini and showing off her taut abs. The TV presenter, who appeared to go makeup free for her tanning session, arrived in South Africa from the UK yesterday. Tonight’s instalment of the popular dating reality show will see at least one more contestant kicked out of the villa following a public vote.
