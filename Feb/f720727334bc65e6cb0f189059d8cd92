Mick McCarthy took over as Blackpool boss last month, more than 30 years after being handed his first managerial role with Millwall. The two-time Ireland manager is celebrating his 64th birthday today - and Express Sport takes a look at his funniest outbursts, from mocking a Steven Gerrard question to taunting a former club. Reaction to Steven Gerrard question In the early stages of the 2011/12 campaign Wolves travelled to Liverpool in the Premier League, with Steven Gerrard returning to action for the first time in six months following a groin injury. When McCarthy was asked if he was pleased that the England international would be involved in the clash, he replied: “Oh aye, thrilled. I’m delighted that they’re getting all their best players back. I don’t want to go up there and win. I want to go up there and let them play and have all their good players in the team.” Ipswich are mocked Back in 2018, McCarthy left then-Championship team Ipswich following a six-year reign at Portman Road. He wasn’t handed a new contract by the club and ended up leaving his role four games early after fans reacted angrily to a substitution he made against Barnsley. McCarthy went on to become Republic of Ireland boss for a second time, with Ipswich suffering relegation to the third tier the following season. And when asked about Chris Hughton’s departure from Brighton in 2019, McCarthy said: “Maybe they just thought it was time for a change. Same for me at Ipswich - they thought it was time for a change. That went well.” READ MORE: Man City must have three Premier League titles stripped if guilty    A potty-mouth tirade After watching his Wolves side lose 1-0 to Reading in the Championship following a second-minute own goal from Neill Collins in January 2009, McCarthy had no issues launching into a foul-mouthed tirade. “F***ing abysmal, that was what I f***ing thought of it,” he said. “Come on, let's get to it - I'm trying my best here. What did I make of it? I thought it was the best bit of f***ing football I've seen in a long time. Do me a favour. It was a c**p start to a game. There you have it, can you print all that? F***ing rubbish, absolute tosh. Drivel. S**te. Bulls**t. That's what I thought of it. Did that help? I'm quite pleased, apart from the fact that's given them the poxy result, I'm f***ing livid about it - of course I am.
