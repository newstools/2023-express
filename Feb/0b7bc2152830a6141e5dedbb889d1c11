 The three leading ladies of Friends reunited as Courteney was honoured with the 2750th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her 38 years of work in the industry. Courteney Cox, 58, was joined by a slew of celebrities including Paul Newman, Laura Dern and her Friends co-stars. In a short speech, Courteney admitted that speaking in public “terrifies me”, and got a bit teary as she thanked Laura, Jennifer and Lisa for supporting her throughout her career. The actress first started in the industry as a model in New York City shortly after graduating high school, earning one of her first big acting accolades on the hit show Family Ties alongside the series’ breakout star Michael J Fox. The producer went on to build her repertoire, including big films like Ace Ventura and did plenty of guest appearances on shows like Seinfeld but catapulted to international fame in 1994 as Monica Geller.
