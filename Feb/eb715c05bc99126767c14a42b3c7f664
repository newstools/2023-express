A devastated mum had to give birth to her baby early so that the child could meet her father who died of cancer just two days afterwards. After the birth of Harper-May, mother Beccy Hunter was then forced to undertake a brutal legal battle to get Jamie Hunter's name on their daughter's birth certificate. In October 2019, the teacher and father-to-be complained of severe pains to the abdomen, and was then diagnosed with kidney cancer, the Mirror reports. Beccy went on to deliver the baby and Jamie met his daughter, but sadly died two days later. The heartbroken mum of six then had to spend Â£3,500 just to get Jamie's name on the birth certificate because the couple weren't married.   Even though Beccy changed her surname from Flint to Hunter before Jamie died, she nonetheless had to go to solicitors and arrange for DNA samples to be collected from Jamie and daughter Harper-May. Jamie's body was then moved from a funeral directors to Heartlands Hospital in Birmingham, which meant she was unable to visit him for almost a month. After meeting with social services, Beccy then appeared in court to explain why she wanted to add Jamie's name on the certificate. She said: "It's been hell, it makes me so mad that we had to go through this. "If we had been married, they would have just taken it as gospel that he was the dad. "It's just because the law is so outdated. Today, lots of people aren't married when they have kids." Beccy also had to endure a social services interview in which she was made to explain why Jamie wanted to be a father and prove she was a fit parent. She added: "When an unmarried couple register a birth, they go to the register office together and that way the dad gives his consent to be named on the birth certificate. "The difficulty here was that Jamie was not here to prove his consent." Two tears after Harper-May was born, Beccy finally had a birth certificate delivered in July 2022 with Jamie's name on.
