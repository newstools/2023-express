  Amanda could be seen smiling as she left her hotel in the fiery red ensemble, which included a large, matching trench coat draped over her shoulders. The Heart Radio presenterâ€™s dress featured a high neckline, with a daring slit at the thigh to show off her incredibly toned legs.

She finished off the ensemble with some dark sunglasses and wore her hair back in a relaxed ponytail.
