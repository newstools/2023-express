Elon Musk has reversed the ban of a Norfolk based bird charity for apparently tweeting about woodcocks. The British Trust for Ornithology, based in Thetford, Norfolk, was preparing for a nationwide survey of woodcocks, a threatened wading bird with the RSPB and BBC.  However, on January 20 disaster struck and they were locked out of their Twitter account. Media manager Tom Stewart said it had been "impossible" to get in touch with anyone from the social media. He said: "We don’t know exactly what happened but we did do a lot of tweets about a bird called a woodcock. "After the age verification prompt, we were locked out for eight days and it was impossible to get hold of anyone from Twitter."  BBC Winterwatch host Chris Packham took up their cause sending Twitter owner Elon Musk a tweet asking for the account to be reinstated on January 27. He said: "I’m afraid the excellent BTO have now inexplicably disappeared. "They are very important and well respected scientists and educators working to support critical conservation projects. Any chance."  READ MORE: Missing walker's haunting words about 'spooky' path before vanishing On January 29 the British Trust for Ornithology account was reinstated. Mr Musk described the ban as "ironic" and attempted a joke about the woodcock. He said: "Most ironic thing I’ve read in a while. How much wood could a woodcock. . ."

Twitter users must verify their date of birth and be at least 13 years old when they open an account, which in the case of the charity was 2009. When the charity's social media officer included their age, Twitter suspended the account.
