Madonna, 64, showed off her ageless appearance as she posed in a lace bralette for her Celebration World Tour rehearsals. The Like a Virgin hit singer declared it was not her "first day at the rodeo" as they rehearsed her hits. She flashed her ample cleavage in the tiny top, which she paired with a tight-fitted pencil skirt and black stockings. Madonna layered up with a black bomber jacket and accessorised with several silver necklaces. Proving she's not bothered about her "ageist" critics, Madonna looked more youthful than ever in the snaps. She sported a light brown cowboy hat, as she captioned the snap in view of her 18.8 million Instagram followers: "Not my first day at the rodeo!"
