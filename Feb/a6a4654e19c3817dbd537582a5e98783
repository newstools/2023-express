Amanda Holden travelled to sunny Dubai for a lavish holiday to celebrate her 52nd birthday. Earlier this month, Amanda arrived in the popular destination with her friends and family and stayed in a lavish villa. Taking to Instagram on Wednesday, Amanda gave her fans a tour of the luxury accommodation which included five bedrooms each with an en-suite, a pool, and a stunning beach view. The villa, which is advertised by Driven Holiday Homes, is available to book for a whopping Â£2,565 per night. In the caption of her post, Amanda wrote: "On our trip to Dubai this year, we opted out of a hotel and into a beautiful villa. It was so relaxing."
