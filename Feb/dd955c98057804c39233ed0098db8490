Martin Roberts has saved a pub after it was closed at the start of lockdown following the Covid pandemic. The Homes Under The Hammer presenter has spilled all the details in an exclusive interview with Express.co.uk. The 59-year-old has big plans to renovate the derelict pub located in Blaencwm in Wales. The BBC favourite said he planned to reopen the pub for the community but didn't initially tell his wife Kirsty Roberts. The small-screen star revealed she was left "surprised" but his supportive wife of 13 years was also intrigued by the move. "I've bought a pub. It's a derelict rundown pub and I'm going to transform into a vital, social community, tourism place," Martin explained.

It closed at the start of lockdown and I want to reopen it to give the community back it's pub but also expand it." He added: "I want to put disabled accomodation in it, all sorts of things, to open up the area and create tourism in the area." Martin has also shared that his latest purchase may be aired on TV screens. He shared: "Hopefully, I'm going to be filming it for a new TV show.  "We haven't had the go ahead yet but we're working on it. I would love for it to be a TV documentary all about the amazing people of the Rhondda Valley. "Also my attempts to run a family pub and a restaurant when I've never done any of the above." Addressing his wife's reaction, Martin said: "There's a slight twist to that. I kind of didn't tell them much about it when I bought it. It was a bit of a surprise. "I was like, 'Erm... I bought a pub.' They were like, 'What?' DON'T MISS...
