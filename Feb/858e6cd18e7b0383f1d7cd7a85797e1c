Newly-traded Dallas Mavericks superstar Kyrie Irving has responded as to why he deleted his apology from his Instagram page after being questioned this week. Irving first apologised two weeks after sharing the film, which contains racial stereotypes connected to the Jewish faith, when he firstly refused to do so when asked on two separate occasions. Irving was suspended by his previous team, the Brooklyn Nets, for five games without pay after he failed to apologise for sharing a link to an antisemitic film on social media. After being traded to Dallas, Irving gave his first press conference as a Maverick on Tuesday, and was quizzed about his social media - which did not feature his apology. Irving responded: "Yeah, I delete a lot of things on my Instagram. I’ve had things that have happened before in my life, probably not as drastic as that moment, which led to a lot of confusion and uncertainty I felt like in what I meant and what I stand for. "I had to just sit up at these mics and explain to the world who I am, and I know who I am. So I delete things all the time, and it’s no disrespect to anyone within the community. Just living my life."  He was then pushed as to if he stood by his apology, responding: "I stand by who I am and why I apologized. I did it because I care about my family. And I have Jewish members of my family that care for me deeply. "Did the media know that beforehand when they called me that word antisemitic? No. Did they know anything about my family? No. Everything was assumed, everything was put out before I had anything to say.  And I reacted instead of responding emotionally and truly. I didn’t need to be defensive or go at anybody. So I stand by my apology and I stand by my people everywhere. All walks of life. All races, all religions." Irving is set to make his debut with the Mavericks on Thursday night against the LA Clippers, having joined up for practice earlier this week.
