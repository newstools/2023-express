Prince Andrew has been tipped to write his own memoir in an effort to clear his name and fix his public image. But would you be interested in reading the Duke of York’s book? Vote in our poll.  A source described as a “long-time friend” of Andrew told the Daily Mail that the Queen’s second son may try to rehabilitate his reputation by putting pen to paper. They claimed: “​​It is inconceivable that he has not thought of this. Plenty in his circle think that’s just what he should do and Fergie, who has written her own memoir, My Story, has got all the contacts in publishing.” Andrew’s ex-wife Sarah Ferguson has written two memoirs, My Story published in 1996 and a second released in 2011 titled Finding Sarah. Prince Edward, Duke of Kent shared his life story last summer, while Andrew’s nephew Prince Harry published his memoir Spare in January, which made a series of claims against the Firm.

Of course, the royals wouldn’t like it, but Fergie did hers and wasn’t ostracised — and as for Harry, they are even now talking about family reconciliation.” Andrew has been living a private life since stepping down from his royal duties in November 2019 following his Newsnight interview. He was later stripped of his HRH status, royal patronages and honorary military titles by the late Queen Elizabeth II when a civil sexual assault case was brought against him by Virginia Giuffre, which was settled out of court. He has repeatedly and vehemently denied the allegations against him and his lawyers say his financial settlement did not equal admission. So how about YOU? Would you read Andrew’s memoir?
