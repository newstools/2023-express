 Hollywood Veteran Kathleen Turner, 68, graced the red carpet on Thursday evening alongside a string of other celebrities. The actress has been in the entertainment business for 45 years now, having received her breakout role in NBC soap The Doctors in 1978. Since then the award-winning star has rubbed shoulders with the likes of Madonna, Hilary Clinton and Calvin Klein. Kathleen proved she still knows how to strut a red carpet, donning an all-black ensemble with comfortable trainers for the opening night of End Game, a play by Samuel Beckett. The Friends actress also had a surprise catch-up with her former Broadway costar, Bill Irwin.
