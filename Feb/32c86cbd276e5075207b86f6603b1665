Ant and Dec didn't hold back on Saturday Night Takeaway as they pulled a series of pranks on audience members and This Morning host Alison Hammond. It was clear the comedy duo were thrilled to be back on screens as they energetically introduced the show and welcomed guest announcer, David Tennant. However, some viewers claimed they were going to complain to Ofcom after a comment Dec made about a studio audience member. As David introduced the comedy duo, Dec shouted: "We're still the only show on telly who says, don't just watch the adverts, win them." "What an audience we have got tonight, it is so good to be back," Ant continued. "Let's say hello to our first star guest announcer of the series, he starred in the likes of Doctor Who and Harry Potter, it's David Tennant." Dec continued: "Now David, gotta speak to you about this, it has had a lot of coverage in the press.

"Well, I don't want to say who I am playing," the actor replied. "Needless to say, I'm going back in time and I am returning as..." "Our guest announcer," the presenters said in sync. Continuing with what was in store, Dec said: "Even though we have been off air, we've still kept a very close eye on all of you here, and all of you out there." Turning to a member of the audience, he continued: Yes, you should look nervous, madam and close your legs." However, Dec's remark sparked a backlash among viewers, and many took to social media to complain. Another segment which caused controversy, was when the pair pranked a dad-to-be with a fake baby scan.
