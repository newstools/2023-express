Charli XCX ensured all eyes were on her as she made her grand entrance to the Brit Awards 2023. Her floor-length dress might have seemed demure at first glance, but on closer inspection, viewers could see she was totally nude underneath save for a pair of white knickers. She completed her eye-popping look with a couple of simple silver bangles, plus some dramatic winged eyeliner. Charli's 2022 album Crash, which she has revealed was inspired by Janet Jackson, has been selling like hot cakes, and it's safe to say there are plenty of fans watching out for the musical star on the red carpet this Saturday.
