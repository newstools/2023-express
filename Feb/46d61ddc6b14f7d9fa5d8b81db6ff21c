Volodymyr Zelensky received a standing ovation in Westminster Hall as he addressed MPs today. The Ukrainian President thanked Britain for its support in the face of Vladimir Putin's brutal invasion, saying he was in the UK on behalf of Ukrainian "warriors" and "every mother and every father who is waiting for their brave son to come back from the war". Mr Zelensky also singled out former prime minister Boris Johnson, who he has struck up a close friendship with, for praise in his speech. He said: "Boris, you got others united when it seemed absolutely impossible." Mr Zelensky used his address to Parliament to urge the UK and the West to provide fighter jets to help defeat Russian forces. He said: "I appeal to you and the world with simple and yet most important words: combat aircraft for Ukraine, wings for freedom." Elsewhere in his speech, the Ukrainian President accused Russia of "investing in violence" through its war in Ukraine. He called for a special tribunal to punish Moscow for its war crimes in Ukraine, saying that "justice is one of ten elements of the peace proposal put forward by Ukraine". As PM, Mr Johnson was widely praised for his response to the Ukraine crisis, with the UK being among the first to provide weapons to support Ukraine in the wake of the invasion. Alongside other Western allies, the UK under Mr Johnson also imposed harsh sanctions on Russian targets.  Mr Zelensky described Mr Johnson as an "important ally" and "friend" to Ukraine. In January, the UK agreed to send next-generation tanks to Kyiv in a bid "to seize on the moment with an acceleration of global military and diplomatic support to Ukraine", Downing Street said. Britain was the first Western nation to upply Kyiv with modern tanks and the move led to others following suit.   The Ukrainian President arrived in London this morning, flying in from Ukraine to Stansted airport. He was met by Mr Sunak on the runway, before the two leaders travelled to Downing Street together. This is Mr Zelensky's first UK visit since the Ukraine war began last February. Mr Zelensky, who for the visit was dressed in his trademark khaki green military fatigues, met the King at Buckingham Palace this afternoon. Later he will meet Ukrainian troops being trained by the British armed forces.
