Manchester City are still reeling from the charges levelled against them by the Premier League earlier this week, with the defending champions having been hit with allegations of over 100 rule breaches relating to their financial activity over the last decade. They appear to be facing a highly uncertain future as things stand after the news was made official on Monday following a lengthy investigation by the Premier League, which drew a passionate response from Pep Guardiola as he spoke about the topic for the first time on Friday. "My first thought is we're already being condemned," said the Spaniard in response to questions about City's situation. "It's the same with UEFA [when City were accused in 2020]. We were already condemned. The club proved we were completely innocent. You know on what side I am. "We are lucky we live in a country where everyone is innocent until proven guilty. It seems like we have already been sentenced. What is going to happen, I don't know. We think we have good lawyers and I think we are going to defend our position. "Time will depend what happens. We will see what a judge, the Premier League decides. In the same way with UEFA, we are innocent." Follow Express Sport's live updates below.
