Australian royal commentator Daniela Elser believes one of the reasons why the Prince of Wales was reportedly particularly shocked to see Harry recounting in his best-selling memoir the behind-the-scenes about the Nazi costume saga dating back to Halloween 2005 may have to do with Kate, the Princess of Wales. In a comment piece for the NZ Herald, Ms Elser wrote: "While Harry and Meghan have both made the Princess out to be a bit of a cold fish who failed to dispense hugs or share lip gloss with appropriate enthusiasm, her involvement in the Nazi uniform escapade is not just unflattering but actually harmful." This reported involvement with Harry's decision to don an incredibly offensive costume represents "a much more serious charge" than all the "bad press" and criticism Kate may have received over the years. In his book Spare, the Duke of Sussex claimed William and Kate played a minor part in his ill-advised decision to wear a Nazi costume at a private gathering. The pair, he wrote in his 416-memoir, "howled" when he showed them his deeply offensive outfit picked for a fancy dress party, and gave him the final push that convinced him to wear it. A photograph of Harry taken by a fellow party-goer later appeared on the front page of a British newspaper. In the memoir, the Duke recalled the shame he felt and how he educated himself on the Holocaust in the months that followed. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATESâ€¦
