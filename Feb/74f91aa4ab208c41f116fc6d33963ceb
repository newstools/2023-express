The Chinese zodiac is represented by 12 animals, all with different personality traits - both good and bad. What's your best quality, according to Chinese astrology? Rat (1948, 1960, 1972, 1984, 1996, 2008, 2020) According to Chinese astrology, Rat has many positive attributes, but one that stands out in particular is "resourcefulness". Rat is a "survivor" and knows what to do in a "crisis" - "whenever it seems all hope is lost, you are the one to pull yourself and others through". Ox (1949, 1961, 1973, 1985, 1997, 2009, 2021) Ox's "persistence" is not to be ignored - this sign will not give up at the first hurdle. Ox is great to have on side during a project: "If you have a goal in mind, you will reach that goal, no matter what."

"You are the one who charges in fearlessly when there are dragons to slay and monsters to overcome." Rabbit (1951, 1963, 1975, 1987, 1999, 2011, 2023) According to Chinese astrology, Rabbit is "intuitive", with their emotional intelligence second to none.

Dragon (1952, 1964, 1976, 1988, 2000, 2012, 2024) Dragon's greatest quality is their "charisma". This sign can truly light up a room and make others feel special. This makes Dragon a great leader, as other signs are in awe of their "fire and tenacity". Snake (1953, 1965, 1977, 1989, 2001, 2013, 2025) People often think that Snake is "wise beyond their years", as they simply "know stuff that others cannot comprehend".

Brave Horse will go where their heart leads them - "and damn the consequences!".

Goat (1955, 1967, 1979, 1991, 2003, 2015, 2027) Goats' most marvellous trait is their "compassion" for others, always willing and ready to help a friend in need.

Monkey (1956, 1968, 1980, 1992, 2004, 2016, 2028) Monkey's greatest quality is their "charm" - they can not only talk the talk but walk the walk too. Monkey has a way of making others laugh incessantly and feel at ease within an instant. Rooster (1957, 1969, 1981, 1993, 2005, 2017, 2029) Chinese astrology maintains the Rooster is the most "outspoken" of the signs, never afraid to speak their mind. This quality means that this sign is great to have around during conflict or confrontation - if they're on your side. "You are brave and ready to stand for what you believe in. If you think something is wrong, then you will speak out, no matter who is watching or listening." Dog (1958, 1970, 1982, 1994, 2006, 2018, 2030) Just like their "furry counterpart", Dog is loyal til the end - "it is your finest quality". Dog will never give up on those they love, even when things get tough, prepared to go through "hell and high water to be there for someone". Pig (1959, 1971, 1983, 1995, 2007, 2019, 2031) One of the "most wonderful" things about Pig is that they have a "genuine soul". "Your inner child shines brightly, and you are open and honest. You tend to accept others for who they are, no matter what they have done or their background," reported Astrology Answers.
