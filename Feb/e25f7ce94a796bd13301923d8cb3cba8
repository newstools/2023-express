Police have been engaged in a high-speed chase after discovering a man was being kept inside a car "against his will". Derbyshire Police said the pursuit, which involved armed officers, dogs and a police helicopter, began after they were alerted to a potential kidnapping. Officers quickly located the suspected vehicle but it took off at high-speed as they approached. Police chased the three suspects through Derby city centre and through Barton-Under-Needwood with the pursuit sometimes going against the flow of traffic. After a chase, the suspects reportedly tried to hide in a nearby housing estate. Derbyshire Roads Policing Unit detailed the chase on Twitter, writing at 1.28pm: "Following a report of a male being held in a car against his will our units locate the vehicle, which immediately makes off. "The driver chooses to lead Derbyshire ARU on a pursuit through Derby city centre and on to Barton-Under-Needwood at times going contraflow." Minutes later the unit posted again stating: "The offenders decide they canâ€™t do anymore so decide to ditch and run before going to ground in a nearby housing estate. "NPAS arrive right on time and locate three offenders hiding who are detained by ARU, Derbyshire Police Dog section and RPU." Police arrested the three offenders for kidnap with the driver also being arrested for dangerous driving, failing to stop, disqualified driving and drug driving. The force said the "aggrieved party" had been found with the vehicle and was "safe and well". They also thanked Force Incident Manager, Sarah Barraclough, and the Derbyshire Police Contact Centre for their support.
