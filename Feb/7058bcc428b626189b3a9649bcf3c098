Morrisons has banned a popular product from being sold in its stores following safety concerns. The supermarket has prohibited its sale, with the likes of Tesco and Sainsbury's following suit.  It comes after watermelon-flavoured ELFBAR 600s were discovered to contain at least 50 per cent more nicotine than the legal e-liquid limit. Morrisons, Sainsbury's, and Tesco have all removed the affected watermelon Elf bars from their shelves, but other flavours remain. However, Morrisons has taken it a step further and has banned the sale of all ELFBARs in all of its stores, reports Manchester Evening News. An investigation is ongoing, with the store revealing the product will only return to its shelves once stock fully complies with UK legislation. A spokesperson for Morrisons told ITV News: "As part of our ongoing investigation into the legal compliance of ELFBAR 600 disposable electronic cigarettes with Trading Standards, we have made the decision to remove all flavoured variants from sale. "The products will only be returned to sale once stock that fully complies with UK legislation becomes available".  Tesco is currently investigating the issue about the nicotine levels in the watermelon-flavoured vape with ELFBAR. A Tesco spokesperson said: "We have temporarily removed one ELFBAR vape line from sale as a precautionary measure, whilst the manufacturer urgently investigates these claims." A spokesperson for Sainsbury's said: "We are in close contact with our supplier and have temporarily removed the affected Elf Bar product whilst they investigate further.” A spokesperson for ELFBAR said: ""We found out that some batches of the Elf Bar product have been overfilled in the UK. It appears that e-liquid tank sizes, which are standard in other markets [such as the US], have been inadvertently fitted to some of our UK products. "We wholeheartedly apologise for the inconvenience this has caused."
