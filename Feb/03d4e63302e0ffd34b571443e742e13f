A grandmother says she plans to eat less this year so she can afford her heating bills next winter. Carmel Hill, who has had three strokes, rarely turns on the heating; instead, she keeps herself warm with blankets and dressing gowns. The rising cost of gas and electricity has left the 58-year-old unable to pay her bills, and she is in debt to her supplier. The former painter and decorator, who lives alone in her flat in Castle Vale, West Midlands, can no longer work because of her health problems. She explained how she intends to cut costs on shopping and other essentials during spring and summer in preparation for when the weather turns cold again, reports Birmingham Live.  She says she will not need to eat as much in the summer to help stay warm and will get by on as little as she can. Bills will rise again in April when the monthly energy bill discount comes to an end and average prices rise to £3,000 a year, increasing the strain on millions.  Carmel said: "I'm looking at £167 a month at the moment. I don't know how families are going to be coping. "I normally have my onesie on and my dressing gown. It's sometimes warmer outside than it is inside so every time I get the chance I go out for a little walk. "It's just when it's cold, my circulation means I can't go out. "When it comes to summer I'm going to have to find extra. "I'll be keeping my bills down where I can, watching what I spend when it comes to shopping. "In the summer time I can cut back on my food as I don't need as much to keep warm." Ms Hill added: "It shouldn't be like this. "We're supposed to be one of the wealthiest countries in the world but I'm having to look at what I eat in the summer so I can afford to eat in the winter and use the heating at the same time."
