Britney Spears, 41, sparked concern among fans as she left Instagram in late January. However, the singer has now returned with a series of topless snaps as she posed on top of a lush bed with just some blue-patterned underwear. The pop sensation also posted a short clip, showing only her ceiling, as she sang her 2000 hit track Oops!...I Did It Again. Within a few hours each post received tens of thousands of likes, with the clip of her singing garnering almost 100,000 in just four hours. Britney also proved sheâ€™s her own worst critic as she sarcastically berated her singing, photography and styling skills in all three posts.
