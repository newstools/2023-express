This is the shocking moment a dogwalker was kicked in a head by a rampaging moose running down a path. Tracy Hansen was taking her dog, Gunner, on their usual walk when she was struck by the giant mammal in snowy Alaska, US. In the clip, filmed by the passenger of a passing car, the moose runs down a street behind Ms Hansen, who appears unaware. “Knowing that the moose had been somewhere behind me and now, here this moose is in front of me, and I’m like, ‘Was that the moose?’” Ms Hansen added. Kate Timmons, who filmed the video, also told the broadcaster: “My husband was able to help pull her over the snow bank, so we could get her in the truck with her dog and kind of get her out of the way. “It definitely seemed unprovoked from our standpoint and it happened so fast it was just like, a matter of getting her out of the situation, getting her help, making sure, you know, my big thing was that she didn’t have a head trauma, that there wasn’t a bleed or something.” Ms Hansen said of Ms Timmons: “Kate and I were discussing that the Lord put her in the right place, at the right time to be able to help.” READ MORE: Biden slams Putin's 'craven lust for land and power' Despite the moose attack, Ms Hansen will continue to walk her dog on the same route in the city of Anchorage. There are approximately 1,500 moose in the state capital and they are regularly seen around the city. According to Alaska’s Department of Fish and Game, more people in Alaska are injured by moose than by bears each year. Earlier in February, Arkansas native Bridgett Watkins and her sled dog team were attacked by a bull moose for over an hour while visiting the state.
