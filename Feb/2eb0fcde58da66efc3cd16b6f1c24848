Super Bowl LVII is upon us, and NFL fans are desperate to get into the State Farm Arena to see Patrick Mahomes and Jalen Hurts in action. The Kansas City Chiefs are taking on the Philadelphia Eagles, and fans are forced to pay extortionate amounts to get in. The Chiefs are aiming to create a dynasty after winning the Super Bowl in 2019. Mahomes, who had an incredible year, is hoping to win the Vince Lombardi Trophy for the second time in his career. Standing in their way are the Eagles, who had one of the best seasons in their franchise's history. Led by quarterback Hurts, the Eagles have been somewhat of a surprise package and are aiming to win their second ring in five years. Tickets, as they do every year, sold out in minutes, with fans desperate to see the biggest game in the world. But for those fans leaving it until the last minute, they face forking out a significant amount. According to Ticketmaster, the official resale site of the NFL, tickets are selling for as much as £20,000. Those, of course, are the most expensive ones currently on resale, with the cheapest starting at £2,983. Mahomes has been nursing an injury since the Divisional Round, having suffered a high-grade ankle sprain, and Chiefs head coach Andy Reid conceded he didn't believe the quarterback was fully fit. He told Mirror NFL and Express Sport: “I wouldn’t tell you he’s 100 percent. The training staff works with him endlessly. I guess it’s a tribute to both of them. Pat coming back for more and for those guys cranking on him. Julie [Frymyer] spent most of the time with him, rehabbing him. “We’ve got all the latest and greatest stuff to use technology-wise. He’s used it all and he’s been able to make these jumps here where he can actually function and play in a game, which is pretty remarkable.”
